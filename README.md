  Zw~049.057 is a moderate mass, dusty, early-type galaxy that hosts a powerful compact obscured nucleus (CON, L$_{FIR,CON} \geq$10$^{11}$~L$_{\odot}$). The resolution of HST enabled measurements of the stellar light distribution and characterization of dust features. Zw~049.057 is inclined with a prominent three zone disk; the R$\approx$ 1kpc star forming inner dusty disk contains molecular gas, a main disk with less dust and an older stellar population, and a newly detected outer stellar region at R$&gt;$6~kpc with circular isophotes. Previously unknown polar dust lanes are signatures of a past minor merger that could have warped the outer disk to near face-on. Dust transmission measurements provide lower limit gas mass estimates for dust features. An extended region with moderate optical depth and M$\geq$ 2$\times$10$^8$~M$_{\odot}$ obscures the central 2~kpc. Optical spectra show strong interstellar Na~D absorption with a constant velocity across the main disk, likely arising in this extraplanar medium. Opacity measurements of the two linear dust features, pillars, give a total mass of $\geq$10$^6$~M$_{\odot}$, flow rates of $\geq$2~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$, and few Myr flow times. Dust pillars are associated with the CON and are visible signs of its role in driving large-scale feedback. Our assessments of feedback processes suggest gas recycling sustains the CON. However, radiation pressure driven mass loss and efficient star formation must be avoided for the AGN to retain sufficient gas over its lifespan to produce substantial mass growth of the central black hole.

  The phenomenon of changing-look (CL) behavior in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is characterized by dramatic changes in luminosity and/or emission line profiles over relatively short periods, ranging from months to years. The origin of CL-AGNs remains a mystery, but one proposed explanation involves the response of the inner AGN disk to tidal disruption events (TDEs) around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this Letter, we calculate the predicted frequency of AGN TDEs as a function of SMBH mass and compare the results to the observed CL-AGN distribution. We find that if the fraction of CL-AGNs caused by AGN-TDEs is high, then: (1) most SMBHs in CL-AGN are near maximal spin, with the dimensionless spin parameter $a&gt;0.9$; (2) AGN inner disks have a high surface density ($\geq 10^{7}\, {\rm g\, cm^{-2}}$); (3) typical AGN lifetimes are $\sim 10$-$100$ Myr; and (4) a nuclear star cluster initial mass function (IMF) that scales as $\sim m_*^{-1.6}$ is preferred. Future observations of CL-AGN will help constrain the fraction of CL-AGNs caused by AGN-TDEs, SMBH spins, AGN lifetimes, and the nuclear star cluster IMF.

  The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, which had exhibited no prior optical variations during the preceding two decades, began showing significant nuclear variability in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream from December 2019 (as ZTF19acnskyy). Its behaviour suggests that SDSS1335+0728 hosts a $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) that is currently in the process of `turning on'. We present a multi-wavelength photometric analysis and spectroscopic follow-up performed with the aim of better understanding the origin of the nuclear variations detected in SDSS1335+0728. We used archival photometry and spectroscopic data to study the state of SDSS1335+0728 prior to December 2019, and new observations from Swift, SOAR/Goodman, VLT/X-shooter, and Keck/LRIS taken after its turn-on to characterise its current state. We find that: (a) since 2021, the UV flux is four times brighter than the flux reported by GALEX in 2004; (b) since June 2022, the mid-infrared flux has risen more than two times, and the W1-W2 WISE colour has become redder; (c) since February 2024, the source has begun showing X-ray emission; (d) the narrow emission line ratios are now consistent with a more energetic ionising continuum; (e) broad emission lines are not detected; and (f) the [OIII] line increased its flux $\sim 3.6$ years after the first ZTF alert, which implies a relatively compact narrow-line-emitting region. We conclude that the variations observed in SDSS1335+0728 could be either explained by an AGN that is just turning on or by an exotic tidal disruption event (TDE). If the former is true, SDSS1335+0728 is one of the strongest cases of an AGN observed in the process of activating. If the latter, it would correspond to the longest and faintest TDE ever observed (or another class of still unknown nuclear transient). Future observations of SDSS1335+0728 are crucial to further understand its behaviour.

  Given their dominance of the galaxy number density, dwarf galaxies are central to our understanding of galaxy formation. While the incidence of AGN and their impact on galaxy evolution has been extensively studied in massive galaxies, much less is known about the role of AGN in the evolution of dwarfs. We search for radiatively-efficient AGN in the nearby (0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3) dwarf (10^8 MSun &lt; M &lt; 10^10 MSun) population, using SED fitting (via Prospector) applied to deep ultraviolet to mid-infrared photometry of 508 dwarf galaxies. Around a third (32 +/- 2 per cent) of our dwarfs show signs of AGN activity. We compare the properties of our dwarf AGN to control samples, constructed from non-AGN, which have the same distributions of redshift and stellar mass as their AGN counterparts. KS tests between the AGN and control distributions indicates that the AGN do not show differences in their distances to nodes, filaments and nearby massive galaxies from their control counterparts. This indicates that AGN triggering in the dwarf regime is not strongly correlated with local environment. The fraction of AGN hosts with early-type morphology and those that are interacting are also indistinguishable from the controls within the uncertainties, suggesting that interactions do not play a significant role in inducing AGN activity in our sample. Finally, the star formation activity in dwarf AGN is only slightly lower than that in their control counterparts, suggesting that the presence of radiatively-efficient AGN does not lead to significant, prompt quenching of star formation in these systems.
