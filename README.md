  We report the discovery of a binary galaxy cluster merger via a search of the redMaPPer optical cluster catalog, with a projected separation of 535 kpc between the BCGs. Archival XMM-Newton spectro-imaging reveals a gas peak between the BCGs, suggesting a recent pericenter passage. We conduct a galaxy redshift survey to quantify the line-of-sight velocity difference ($153\pm281$ km/s) between the two subclusters. We present weak lensing mass maps from archival HST/ACS imaging, revealing masses of $M_{200}=4.5\pm0.8\times10^{14}$ and $2.8\pm0.7\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ associated with the southern and northern galaxy subclusters respectively. We also present deep GMRT 650 MHz data revealing extended emission, 420 kpc long, which may be an AGN tail but is potentially also a candidate radio relic. We draw from cosmological n-body simulations to find analog systems, which imply that this system is observed fairly soon (60-271 Myr) after pericenter, and that the subcluster separation vector is within 22$^\circ$ of the plane of the sky, making it suitable for an estimate of the dark matter scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM}=1.1\pm0.6$ cm$^2$/g, suggesting that further study of this system could support interestingly tight constraints.

  We report the discovery of three HI absorbers toward low-power radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in a pilot HI absorption survey with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Compared to past studies, FAST observations have explored lower radio powers by $\sim$0.4 dex and detected these weakest absorbers at given redshifts. By comparing the gas properties and kinematics of sources along radio powers, we aim to explore the interplay between AGN and the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). Compared to brighter sources at similar redshifts, our observations suggest a slightly lower detection rate of HI absorption lines ($\sim$$11.5\%$) in low-power radio AGNs with $\text{log}(P_{\text{1.4 GHz}}/\text{W Hz}^{-1})=21.8-23.7$. The low-power sources with $\text{log}(P_{\text{1.4 GHz}}/\text{W Hz}^{-1})&lt;23$ have a lower detection rate of $\sim$$6.7\%$. Due to the incompleteness of the sample, these detection rates may represent the lower limits. The selection of more extended sources and dilution by HI emission at lower redshifts may contribute to the lower detection rate of HI absorption lines. These detected absorbers present relatively narrow line widths and comparable column densities consistent with previous observations. One absorber has a symmetric profile with a large velocity offset, while the other two show asymmetric profiles that can be decomposed into multiple components, suggesting various possibilities of gas origins and kinematics. These HI absorbers may have connections with rotating disks, gas outflows, galactic gas clouds, gas fueling of the AGN, and jet-ISM interactions, which will be further investigated with the upcoming systematic survey and spatially resolved observations.

  Mrk 1018 is a nearby changing-look AGN that has oscillated between spectral Type 1.9 and Type 1 over a period of 40 years. Recently, a recoiling supermassive black hole (rSMBH) scenario has been proposed to explain the spectral and flux variability observed in this AGN. Detections of rSMBHs are important for understanding the processes by which SMBH binaries merge and how rSMBHs influence their galactic environment through feedback mechanisms. However, conclusive identification of any rSMBHs has remained elusive to date. In this paper, we present an analysis of 6.5 years of multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) monitoring of Mrk 1018. We find that the radio emission is compact down to 2.4 pc, and displays flux density and spectral variability over the length of our campaign, typical of a flat spectrum radio core. We observe proper motion in RA of the radio core at -36.4 $\pm$ 8.6 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ (4.2$\sigma$), or $0.10c \pm 0.02c$ at the redshift of Mrk 1018. No significant proper motion is found in DEC (31.3 $\pm$ 25.1 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$). We discuss possible physical mechanisms driving the proper motion, including a rSMBH. We conclude that the apparent velocity we observe of the VLBI radio core is too high to reconcile with theoretical predictions of rSMBH velocities and that the proper motion is most likely dominated by an unresolved, outflowing jet component. Future observations may yet reveal the true nature of Mrk 1018. However, our observations are not able to confirm it as a true rSMBH.

  Radio galaxies are a subclass of active galactic nuclei in which accretion onto the supermassive black hole releases energy via relativistic jets. The jets are not constantly active throughout the life of the host galaxy and alternate between active and quiescent phases. Remnant radio galaxies are detected during a quiescent phase and define a class of unique sources to constrain the AGN duty cycle. We present, a spatially resolved radio analysis of the radio galaxy associated with NGC 6086 and constraints on the spectral age of the diffuse emission to investigate the duty cycle and evolution of the source. We use three new low-frequency, high-sensitivity observations, performed with the Low Frequency Array at 144 MHz and with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 400 MHz and 675 MHz. To these, we add two Very Large Array archival observations at 1400 and 4700 MHz. In the new observations, we detect a second pair of larger lobes and three regions with a filamentary morphology. We analyse the spectral index trend in the inner remnant lobes and see systematic steeper values at the lower frequencies compared to the GHz ones. Steeper spectral indices are found in the newly detected outer lobes (up to 2.1), as expected if they trace a previous phase of activity of the AGN. However, the differences between the spectra suggest different dynamical evolution within the intragroup medium during their expansion and/or different magnetic field values. We place constraints on the age of the inner and outer lobes and derive the duty cycle of the source. This results in a total active time of $\sim$39%. The filamentary structures have a steep spectral index ($\sim$1) without any spectral index trend and only one of them shows a steepening in the spectrum. Their origin is not yet clear, but they may have formed due to the compression of the plasma or due to magnetic field substructures.
