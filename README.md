  The jets of radio AGN provide one of the most important forms of AGN feedback, yet considerable uncertainties remain about how they are triggered. Since the molecular gas reservoirs of the host galaxies can supply key information about the dominant triggering mechanism(s), here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) CO(1-0) observations of a complete sample of 29 powerful radio AGN ($P_{1.4GHz} &gt; 10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.3$) with an angular resolution of about 2 - 3 arcsec (corresponding to 2 - 8 kpc). We detect molecular gas with masses in the range $10^{8.9} &lt; M_{H_2} &lt; 10^{10.2}$ M$_{\odot}$ in the early-type host galaxies of 10 targets, while for the other 19 sources we derive upper limits. The detection rate of objects with such large molecular masses -- $34\pm9$% -- is higher than in the general population of non-active early-type galaxies (ETG: $&lt;$10%). The kinematics of the molecular gas are dominated in most cases by rotating disk-like structures, with diameters up to 25 kpc. Compared with the results for samples of quiescent ETG in the literature, we find a larger fraction of more massive, more extended and less settled molecular gas structures. In most of the CO-detected sources, the results are consistent with triggering of the AGN as the gas settles following a merger or close encounter with a gas-rich companion. However, in a minority of objects at the centres of rich clusters of galaxies, the accretion of gas cooling from the hot X-ray halos is a plausible alternative to galaxy interactions as a triggering mechanisms.

  [Abridged] The relation between nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and the growth of the central SMBHs, as well as their connection to the properties of the host galaxies, is crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Recent observations have revealed that about 10 per cent of nucleated galaxies host hybrid nuclei, consisting of both NSCs and accreting SMBHs that power active galactic nuclei (AGN). Motivated by the potential of the recently published multi-wavelength data sets from LeMMINGs survey, here we present the most thorough investigation to date of the incidence of hybrid nuclei in a large sample of 100 nearby nucleated galaxies (10 E, 25 S0, 63 S, and 2 Irr), covering a wide range in stellar mass ($M_{*,\rm gal} \sim 10^{8.7}-10^{12}~\rm M_{sun}$). We identify the nuclei and derive their properties by performing detailed 1D and 2D multi-component decompositions of the optical and near-infrared $HST$ stellar light distributions of the galaxies using S\'ersic and core-S\'ersic models. Our AGN diagnostics are based on homogeneously derived nuclear 1.5 GHz $e$-MERLIN radio, $Chandra$ X-ray (0.3--10 keV) and optical emission-line data. We determine the nucleation fraction ($f_{\rm nuc} $) as the relative incidence of nuclei across the LeMMINGs $HST$ sample and find $f_{\rm nuc} =~ $100/149 (= 67 $\pm$ 7 per cent), confirming previous work, with a peak value of 49/56~(= $88 \pm 13$ per cent) at bulge masses $M_{*,\rm bulge} \sim 10^{9.4}$- $10^{10.8}~\rm M_{sun}$. We identify 30 nucleated LeMMINGs galaxies that are optically active, radio-detected and X-ray luminous ($L_{X} &gt; 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$). This indicates that our nucleated sample has a lower limit $\sim$ 30 per cent occupancy of hybrid nuclei, which is a function of $M_{*,\rm bulge}$ and $M_{*,\rm gal}$. We find that hybrid nuclei have a number density of $(1.5 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.

  (abridged)Photometric redshifts for AGN (galaxies hosting an accreting supermassive black hole in their center) are notoriously challenging and currently better computed via SED fitting, assuming that deep photometry for many wavelengths is available. However, for AGN detected all-sky, the photometry is limited and provided by different projects. This makes the task of homogenising the data challenging and is a dramatic drawback for the millions of AGN that wide surveys like SRG/eROSITA will detect. This work aims to compute reliable photometric redshifts for X-ray-detected AGN using only one dataset that covers a large area: the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey (LS10) for DESI. LS10 provides deep grizW1-W4 forced photometry within various apertures, thus avoids issues related to the cross-calibration of surveys. We present the results from CircleZ, a machine-learning algorithm based on a Fully Connected Neural Network. CircleZ uses training sample of 14,000 X-ray-detected AGN and utilizes multi-aperture photometry. The accuracy and the fraction of outliers reached in a test sample of 2913 AGN are 0.067 and 11.6%, respectively. The results are comparable to or better than those obtained previously for the same field but with much less effort. We further tested the stability of the results by computing the photometric redshifts for the sources detected in CSC2 and Chandra-COSMOS Legacy, reaching comparable accuracy as in eFEDS when limiting the magnitude of the counterparts with respect to the depth of LS10. The method applies to fainter samples of AGN using deeper optical data from future surveys (e.g., LSST, Euclid), granted LS10-like information on the light distribution beyond a morphological type is provided. With the paper, we release an updated version of the photometric redshifts (including errors and probability distribution function) for eROSITA/eFEDS.   

Little Red Dots: Rapidly Growing Black Holes Reddened by Extended Dusty

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revolutionized extragalactic research, particularly with the discovery of little red dots (LRD), which we propose are dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their unique v-shape spectral feature observed through JWST/NIRCam challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV-optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at $\lambda&gt;4000$ A and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at $\lambda&lt;3000$ A, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution ($\gamma&lt;1$; $\rho\propto r^{-\gamma}$) with a characteristic gas density of $\simeq 10-10^3~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation, thereby shifting the energy peak from near- to mid-infrared bands. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift universe younger than one billion years.

  We carried out long-term monitoring of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA binary black hole (BBH) merger candidate S230922g in search of electromagnetic emission from the interaction of the merger remnant with an embedding active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disk. Using a dataset primarily composed of wide-field imaging from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and supplemented by additional photometric and spectroscopic resources, we searched ~ 70% of the sky area probability for transient phenomena, and discovered 6 counterpart candidates. One especially promising candidate - AT 2023aagj - exhibited temporally varying asymmetric components in spectral broad line regions, a feature potentially indicative of an off-center event such as a BBH merger. This represents the first live search and multiwavelength, photometric, and spectroscopic monitoring of a GW BBH optical counterpart candidate in the disk of an AGN.

  Stellar mass, binary black hole (BBH) mergers dominates the sources of gravitational wave (GW) events so far detected the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) experiment. The origin of these BBHs is unknown, and no electromagnetic (EM) counterpart has been undoubtedly associated to any of such GW events. The thin discs of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) might be viable environments where BBHs can form and at the same time produce observable radiation feedback. This paper presents new physically motivated light-curve (LC) solutions for thermal flares driven by the remnant of a BBH merger within the disc of an AGN. Following previous analyses, we consider that the BBH likely creates an under-density cavity in the disc prior to its coalescence. Depending on the merger conditions, the black hole (BH) remnant can leave the cavity, interact with the unperturbed disc, and drive a transient BH wind. The wind expels disc material that expands above and below the disc plane and we consider the emission of these plasma ejections as the EM counterpart to the merger GW. We model the LC of such eruptions as mini supernovae explosions finding that stellar mass merger remnants can drive distinguishable flares in optical and UV bands, with time lags of $\sim 10-40$ ($100-400$) days after the GW event, lasting for a few days (weeks) when occurring in AGN with central engines of $\sim 10^6$ ($10^7$) M$_\odot$. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory can potentially detect the optical component of these EM counterparts up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.5 - 1$, accordingly. The present LC models are applicable to localise flaring AGNs as sources of multi-messenger emission following GW alerts.

  We present an enhanced version of the publicly-available Stripe 82X catalog (S82-XL), featuring a comprehensive set of 22,737 unique X-ray point sources identified with a significance $\gtrsim 4\sigma$. This catalog is four times larger than the original Stripe 82X catalog, by including additional archival data from the Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Now covering $\sim54.8$ deg$^2$ of non-overlapping sky area, the S82-XL catalog roughly doubles the area and depth of the original catalog, with limiting fluxes (half-area fluxes) of 3.4$\times 10^{-16}$ (2.4$\times 10^{-15}$), 2.9$\times 10^{-15}$ (1.5$\times 10^{-14}$), and 1.4$\times 10^{-15}$ (9.5$\times 10^{-15}$) erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ across the soft (0.5-2 keV), hard (2-10 keV), and full (0.5-10 keV) bands, respectively. S82-XL occupies a unique region of flux-area parameter space compared to other X-ray surveys, identifying sources with rest-frame luminosities from $1.2\times 10^{38}$ to $1.6\times 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 2-10 keV band (median X-ray luminosity, $7.2\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and spectroscopic redshifts up to $z\sim6$. By using hardness ratios, we derived Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) obscuration obtaining a median value of $N_H=21.6_{-1.6}^{+1.0}$, and an overall, obscured fraction ($\log N_H/\mathrm{cm^{-2}}&gt;22$) of $\sim 36.9\%$. S82-XL serves as a benchmark in X-ray surveys and, with its extensive multiwavelength data, is especially valuable for comprehensive studies of luminous AGNs.

  Broad Line Regions (BLRs) are known to contain gravitationally-bound gas within r~(few) 10^2-10^3 Schwarszchild radii (Rs) near supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Photo-ionized by strong non-stellar AGN continuum, this gas emits luminous ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared lines from ionized hydrogen (and other multi-ionized atoms) that have the widest velocity profiles observed in galaxies, uniquely indicating the deep gravitational wells of SMBHs. Nearly all BLR studies focus on its ionized gas phase (hereafter BLR+), with typical masses of only a few 10-100 M_Sun, despite strong indications of neutral BLR gas reservoirs (hereafter BLR0) with M_BLR0~10^{5-6} M_Sun. We used the photoionization code CLOUDY, with its chemistry augmented using three-body reactions, to explore 1-D models of dustless BLRs, focusing on the BLR0 conditions, and the abundances of its most prevalent neutral atoms and molecules. A neutral-atom-) and molecule-rich BLR0 gas phase is found underlying the BLR+, the latter occupying only a thin outer layer of AGN-irradiated gas column densities, while the former contains the bulk of the BLR gas mass. Atomic carbon and oxygen as well as the CO molecule can reach substantial abundances in the BLR0, while their lines at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths can yield new probes of the BLR physical conditions and dynamics, unhindered by the dust absorption from outer AGN tori that readily absorb the BLR+ optical/far-ultraviolet (FUV) lines. We find that neutral-atom-rich neutral-atom-rich and even molecule-rich gas can exist in the BLR0. The corresponding spectral lines from neutral atoms and molecules promise a new spectral window of gas dynamics in the vicinity of~SMBHs unhindered by dust absorption. This may even offer the prospect of conducting novel tests of general relativity in strongly curved spacetimes.
