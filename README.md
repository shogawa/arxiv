  Binary black holes (BBHs) forming in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production. BBHs are typically expected to originate at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We quantify where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that while the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps, a substantial fraction takes place elsewhere in the disk, particularly for high-viscosity disks ($\alpha=0.1-0.4$) and SMBHs with mass above a threshold of $10^{7.5}$ solar masses, where differential migration is most efficient. The inclusion of thermal torques favors pair-up in outer locations of the disk and facilitates rapid pair-up. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups are more tightly clustered around trap locations. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.

  The knowledge of the X-ray properties of the hot gas halos of early-type galaxies has significantly advanced in the past years, for large and homogeneously investigated samples. We compare these results with the X-ray properties of an exploratory set of gas evolution models in realistic early-type galaxies, produced with our high-resolution 2D hydrodynamical code MACER that includes AGN feedback and accretion from a circumgalactic medium. The model X-ray emission and absorption are integrated along the line of sight, to obtain maps of the surface brightness Sigma_X and temperature Tx. The X-ray diagnostics considered are the luminosity and average temperature for the whole galaxy (Lx and &lt;Tx&gt;) and within 5 optical effective radii (Lx5 and &lt;Tx5&gt;), and the circularized profiles Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R). The values for Lx, Lx5, &lt;Tx&gt;, and &lt;Tx5&gt; compare very well with those observed. The Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) also present qualitative similarities with those of the representative galaxy NGC5129, and of ETGs with the most commonly observed shape for Tx(R): Sigma_X(R) matches the observed profile over many optical effective radii Re, and Tx(R) reproduces the characteristic bump that peaks at R=(1 - 3)Re. Inside the peak position, Tx(R) declines towards the center, but the explored models are systematically hotter by ~30%; possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. Interestingly, Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) as large as observed outside of R~Re are reproduced only with significant accretion from a circumgalactic medium, highlighting its importance.

  Active Galactic Nucleus jets have long be thought to exhibit a conical jet shape, but recently, several jets were found to have a transition from parabolic to conical structure. As more sources are investigated, this collimation profile appears to represent a common paradigm. Previous works suggest that the Bondi radius may serve as an indicator of the transition location, although discrepancies have been observed in some sources. To explore this further, we selected CTA 102 for which existing literature presents mixed evidence regarding the presence of a jet geometry break. We investigated the jet width profile of CTA 102 to study the possible transition changes in the jet, thereby improving the understanding of connection between Bondi radius and jet transition. We used multi-frequency VLBA images of CTA 102 at 2, 5, and 8 (single epoch), and 15, 22 and 43 GHz (stacked). The jet width profile was modeled with a single power law $W_{jet}\propto r^{\epsilon}$ yielding a power-law index of $\epsilon=0.69\pm0.02$, indicative of a quasi-parabolic geometry with no clear transition to a conical regime. The absence of discernible structural break around the Bondi radius implies that the physical conditions associated with the radius alone are insufficient to explain the jet collimation behaviour. On the other hand, we observe oscillatory features in the jet width profile, suggesting the influence of additional physical processes beyond gravitational confinement. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of jet collimation in AGN and highlight the complexity of jet-environment interactions.

  We present a multiwavelength spectroscopic survey of 23 luminous mid-infrared-selected Type-2 quasars at redshifts z = 0.88 to 3.49. The targets were selected in the SDSS Stripe 82 field based on their bright WISE W4 detections (flux &gt; 5 mJy) and extremely faint or red optical counterparts (e.g., r &gt; 23 or r - W4 &gt; 8.4), designed to identify heavily obscured quasars. Deep near-infrared (Gemini/GNIRS) and optical (Keck/LRIS and KCWI) spectroscopy confirm 23 out of 24 candidates as Type-2 quasars in this redshift range, including 12 objects at z &gt; 2. The spectra exhibit strong rest-frame UV and optical emission lines (Ly-alpha, C IV, [O III], H-alpha) with a wide range of line widths, indicating significant spectral diversity. Approximately one-third of the sample (8 of 23) shows broad H-alpha emission (FWHM &gt; 2000 km/s) despite their Type-2 classification, while the rest have only narrow lines (FWHM &lt; 2000 km/s) characteristic of classical obscured quasars. Notably, these broad-line Type-2 quasars share similar spectral energy distributions with the JWST-discovered "little red dot" (LRD) AGNs, suggesting that our sample could be lower-redshift analogues of the heavily obscured broad-line AGNs uncovered by JWST. We also find that the [O III] 5007 angstrom emission is relatively weak for their high bolometric luminosities, deviating from trends seen in lower-redshift Type-2 QSOs. A new composite spectrum for Type-2 QSOs is built using our sample. Overall, our results demonstrate that mid-IR selection efficiently uncovers a diverse population of obscured quasars and that spectroscopic follow-up is crucial for revealing their true nature. This study provides new insights into heavily obscured SMBH growth at cosmic noon and bridges the gap to the obscured AGN populations now being revealed by JWST.

  Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) with mildly relativistic velocities are frequently observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The line-force-driving mechanism is often taken as a potential mechanism for driving UFOs. Due to the line-force-driven winds moving at mildly relativistic velocities, the special relativistic effects become important. There are two special relativistic effects: one is the influence of the disc rotation on the radiation field; the other is the radiation-drag effect. We wish to study the influence of the special relativistic effects on the line-force-driven winds, and we performed numerical simulations to investigate this. We find that the line-force-driven winds are significantly weakened when the special relativistic effects are considered. Compared with the case without special relativistic effects, when special relativistic effects are considered the winds are closer to the disc surface, the maximum speed of winds is reduced by $\sim$20 percent--70 percent, and the mass outflow rate and the kinetic power is significantly reduced.
