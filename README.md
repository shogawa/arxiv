  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) observed with the technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) are used as fiducial references on the sky to precisely measure the shape and orientation of the Earth. Their positions form a celestial reference frame that plays an important role in both astronomy and geodesy. This study investigates the accuracy and stability of the positions of the AGNs that are measured by simultaneous VLBI observations at 3.3, 5.5, 6.6, and 10.5 GHz. Based on position time series from dedicated geodetic solutions, we characterize the observed source position variations and identify the possible factors causing such variations. We find that the primary contributor is source structure for sources above 20-degree declination while the sensitivity of the observations to the declination coordinate predominates for sources below 20-degree declination. The position time series are further explored to derive more realistic uncertainties for the quad-band positions. Significant position offsets with respect to the positions at 2.2/8.6 GHz are found for 15% of the sources. For 6% of the sources, the offsets are larger than 0.8 milli-arcseconds. Source structure may be divided into two parts: the invisible structure (within the beam size) and the visible structure (on larger scales). The latter causes closure delays enlarging post-fit delay residuals in geodetic solutions whereas the former causes source position changes. Such position changes will contribute significantly to the offsets between radio and optical positions. Overall, this work highlights the necessity to have a specific quad-band catalog for processing operational quad-band observations.

  Context. Quasar outflows play a significant role in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, impacting the interstellar medium and potentially influencing galaxy evolution. Characterizing these outflows is essential for understanding AGN-driven processes. Aims. We aim to analyze the physical properties of the mini-broad absorption line outflow in quasar J1402+2330 using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. We seek to measure the outflows location, energetics, and potential impact on AGN feedback processes. Methods. In the spectrum of J1402+2330, we identify multiple ionic absorption lines, including ground and excited states. We measure the ionic column densities and then use photoionization models to determine the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter of the outflow. We utilized the population ratio of the excited state to the ground state of N iii and S iv to determine the electron number density. Results. The derived electron number density, combined with the ionization parameter, indicates an outflow distance of approximately 2200 pc from the central source. Having a mass outflow rate of more than one thousand solar masses per year and a kinetic energy output exceeding 5 percent of the Eddington luminosity, this outflow can significantly contribute to AGN feedback. Conclusions. Our findings suggest the absorption outflow in J1402+2330 plays a potentially significant role in AGN feedback processes. This study highlights the value of DESI data in exploring AGN feedback mechanisms.

  We report the discovery of a $z\sim7$ group of galaxies that contains two Little Red Dots (LRDs) just 3.3 kpc apart, along with three satellite galaxies, as part of the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). These LRDs are massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$) and dusty (A(V) $&gt;1$ mag) whereas the three satellites are lower-mass objects ($M_\star\sim10^{8-9}\,M_\odot$) subject to low dust attenuations. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this LRD pair show strong evidence for a Balmer Break, consistent with a recent ($\sim 100$ Myr) quenching of star formation. In contrast, the satellites are compatible with a recent-onset ($\sim 100$ Myr), ongoing burst of star formation. LRD1's SED is consistent with a dust-free AGN as the source of the UV excess in the galaxy. The optical continuum would be powered by the emission from an obscured post-starburst and the AGN at a subdominant level. LRD2's SED is more ambiguous to interpret, but it could also be indicative of a dust-free AGN. The proximity of the two LRDs suggests that their interaction may be responsible for their recent star formation histories, which can be interpreted as environmental bursting and quenching in the Epoch of Reionization.
