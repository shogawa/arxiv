  We present a detailed study of the kinematics of 19 QSO2s in the range 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.41 and [OIII] luminosities $L_{[OIII]} &gt; 10^{8.5}$L$_{\odot}$. We aim at advancing our understanding of the AGN feedback phenomenon by correlating outflow properties with the presence of young stellar populations (YSPs) with ages &lt;100 Myr, the optical morphology and the environment of the galaxies, and the radio luminosity.   We characterize the ionized gas kinematics using the [OIII]$\lambda$5007$\r{A}$ profiles, through three different outflow detection methods: multi-component parametric and flux-weighted and peak-weighted non-parametric.   We detect ionized outflows in 18 QSO2s using the parametric analysis, and in all of them using the non-parametric methods. We find higher outflow masses using the parametric analysis (log M$_{OF}$(M$_{\odot}$)=6.47$\pm$0.50), and larger mass rates and kinetic powers with the flux-weighted non-parametric method (\.M$_{OF}$=4.0$\pm$4.4 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and log(\.E$_{kin}$)=41.9$\pm$0.6 erg~s$^{-1}$). However, it is when we use the parametric method and the maximum outflow velocities that we measure the highest outflow mass rates and kinetic energies (23$\pm$35 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 42.9$\pm$0.6 erg s$^{-1}$). We do not find any significant correlation between the outflow properties and the previously mentioned galaxy properties.   4 out of 5 QSO2s without a YS&lt;100 Myr show highly disturbed kinematics, whereas only 5 out of the 14 QSO2s with YSPs show similarly asymmetric [OIII] profiles. This might be indicative of negative feedback. The lack of correlation between the outflow properties and the presence of mergers in different interaction stages might be due to their different dynamical timescales. Lastly, the small radio luminosity range covered by our sample may be impeding the detection of any correlation between radio emission and outflow properties.

  The soft excess is a significant emission component in the Soft (&lt;1 keV) X-ray spectra of many AGN. It has been explained by disk reflection, a warm corona and other models. Understanding its origin is crucial for the energy budget of AGN emission, and for using it to study the inner accretion disk. Here, we track the weeks-to-months variability of several AGN that show different levels of soft excess strength with NICER. We use the variability time scales to compare the relative size of the soft excess emission region to the corona producing the hard X-ray emission above 1 keV. We find that the size of the soft excess emission region relative to the corona is not the same for the three sources studied. For TON S180, the soft excess region is comparable in size to the hard corona. While for MRK 335 and 1H0707-495, the soft excess region is larger than the corona by a factor of 2-4. This is the first time the relative sizes are quantified independently of the assumptions of the spectral models.
