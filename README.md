  We present pure spectroscopic constraints on the UV luminosity functions andcosmic star formation rate (SFR) densities from 25 galaxies at$z_\mathrm{spec}=8.61-13.20$. By reducing the JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken inmultiple programs of ERO, ERS, GO, and DDT with our analysis technique, weindependently confirm 16 galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}=8.61-11.40$ including newredshift determinations, and a bright interloper at $z_\mathrm{spec}=4.91$ thatwas claimed as a photometric candidate at z~16. In conjunction with ninegalaxies at redshifts up to $z_\mathrm{spec}=13.20$ in the literature, we makea sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in total and carefullyderive the best estimates and lower limits of the UV luminosity functions.These UV luminosity function constraints are consistent with the previousphotometric estimates within the uncertainties and indicate mild redshiftevolution towards z~12 showing tensions with some theoretical models of rapidevolution. With these spectroscopic constraints, we obtain firm lower limits ofthe cosmic SFR densities and spectroscopically confirm a high SFR density atz~12 beyond the constant star-formation efficiency models, which supportsearlier claims from the photometric studies. While there are nospectroscopically-confirmed galaxies with very large stellar masses violatingthe $\Lambda$CDM model due to the removal of the bright interloper, we confirmstar-forming galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}=11-13$ with stellar masses muchhigher than model predictions. Our results indicate possibilities of highstar-formation efficiency (&gt;5%), hidden AGN, top-heavy initial mass function(possibly with Pop-III), and large scatter/variance. Having these successfuland unsuccessful spectroscopy results, we suggest observational strategies forefficiently removing low redshift interlopers for future JWST programs.

  Multiwavelength studies indicate that nuclear activity and bulge propertiesare closely related, but the details remain unclear. To study this further, wecombine $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ bulge structural and photometric propertieswith 1.5 GHz, $e$-MERLIN nuclear radio continuum data from the LeMMINGs surveyfor a large sample of 173 `active' galaxies (LINERs and Seyferts) and`inactive' galaxies (H IIs and absorption line galaxies, ALGs). Dividing oursample into active and inactive, they define distinct (radio coreluminosity)$-$(bulge mass), L_R,core-M_*,bulge, relations, with a mass turnoverat M_*, bulge ~ 10^(9.8 +- 0.3) M_sun (supermassive black hole mass M_BH ~10^(6.8 +- 0.3) M_sun), which marks the transition from AGN-dominated nuclearradio emission in more massive bulges to that mainly driven by stellarprocesses in low-mass bulges. None of our 10/173 bulgeless galaxies host anAGN. The AGN fraction increases with increasing M_*, bulge such thatf_optical_AGN $\propto$ M_*,bulge^(0.24 +- 0.06) and f_radio_AGN $\propto$M_*,bulge^(0.24 +- 0.05). Between M_*,bulge ~ 10^8.5 and 10^11.3 M_sun,f_optical_AGN steadily rises from 15 +- 4 to 80 +- 5 per cent. We find that atfixed bulge mass, the radio loudness, nuclear radio activity and the (opticaland radio) AGN fraction exhibit no dependence on environment. Radio-loud hostspreferentially possess an early-type morphology than radio-quiet hosts, the twotypes are however indistinguishable in terms of bulge S\'ersic index andellipticity, while results on the bulge inner logarithmic profile slope areinconclusive. We finally discuss the importance of bulge mass in determiningthe AGN triggering processes, including potential implications for the nuclearradio emission in nearby galaxies.  
NuSTAR Observations of Candidate Subparsec Supermassive Black Holes

  We present analysis of NuSTAR X-ray observations of three AGN that wereidentified as candidate subparsec binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) systemsin the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey based on apparent periodicity intheir optical light curves. Simulations predict that close-separation accretingSMBH binaries will have different X-ray spectra than single accreting SMBHs. Wepreviously observed these AGN with Chandra and found no differences betweentheir low energy X-ray properties and the larger AGN population. However somemodels predict differences to be more prominent at energies higher than probedby Chandra. We find that even at the higher energies probed by NuSTAR, thespectra of these AGN are indistinguishable from the larger AGN population. Thiscould rule out models predicting large differences in the X-ray spectra in theNuSTAR bands. Alternatively, it might mean that these three AGN are not binarySMBHs.  
Morphological asymmetries of quasar host galaxies with Subaru Hyper

  How does the host galaxy morphology influence a central quasar or vice versa?We address this question by measuring the asymmetries of 2424 SDSS quasar hostsat $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8$ using broad-band ($grizy$) images from the Hyper Suprime-CamSubaru Strategic Program. Control galaxies (without quasars) are selected bymatching the redshifts and stellar masses of the quasar hosts. A two-steppipeline is run to decompose the PSF and \sersic\ components, and then measureasymmetry indices ($A_{\rm CAS}$, $A_{\rm outer}$, and $A_{\rm shape}$) of eachquasar host and control galaxy. We find a mild correlation between hostasymmetry and AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) for the full sample(spearman correlation of 0.37) while a stronger trend is evident at the highestluminosities ($L_{\rm bol}&gt;45$). This then manifests itself into quasar hostsbeing more asymmetric, on average, when they harbor a more massive and highlyaccreting black hole. The merger fraction also positively correlates with$L_{\rm bol}$ and reaches up to 35\% for the most luminous. Compared to controlgalaxies, quasar hosts are marginally more asymmetric (excess of 0.017 inmedian at 9.4$\sigma$ level) and the merger fractions are similar ($\sim16.5\%$). We quantify the dependence of asymmetry on optical band whichdemonstrates that mergers are more likely to be identified with the bluer bandsand the correlation between $L_{\rm bol}$ and asymmetry is also stronger insuch bands. We stress that the band dependence, indicative of a changingstellar population, is an important factor in considering the influence ofmergers on AGN activity.  
The Most Obscured AGNs in the XMM-SERVS Fields

  We perform X-ray spectral analyses to derive characteristics (e.g., columndensity, X-ray luminosity) of $\approx$10,200 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) inthe XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS), whichwas designed to investigate the growth of supermassive black holes across awide dynamic range of cosmic environments. Using physical torus models (e.g.,Borus02) and a Bayesian approach, we uncover 22 representative Compton-thick(CT; $N_{\rm H} \;&gt;\; 1.5\times10^{24}\; \rm cm^{-2}$) AGN candidates with goodsignal-to-noise ratios as well as a large sample of 136 heavily obscured AGNs.We also find an increasing CT fraction (\fct ) from low ($z&lt;0.75$) to high($z&gt;0.75$) redshift. Our CT candidates tend to show hard X-ray spectral shapesand dust extinction in their SED fits, which may shed light on the connectionbetween AGN obscuration and host-galaxy evolution.  
Multi-phase gas nature in the sub-pc region of the active galactic
  nuclei I: Dynamical structures of dusty and dust-free outflow  
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05950v1  
Published: 2023-04-12T16:18:37Z  
  We investigated dusty and dust-free gas dynamics for a radiation-drivensub-pc scale outflow in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) associated with asupermassive black hole $10^7 M_\odot$ and bolometric luminosity $10^{44}$ ergs$^{-1}$ based on the two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Aradiation-driven ``lotus-like'' multi-shell outflow is launched from the innerpart ($r \lesssim 0.04$ pc) of the geometrically thin disk, and it repeatedlyand steadily produces shocks as mass accretion continues through the disk tothe center. The shape of the dust sublimation radius is not spherical anddepends on the angle ($\theta$) from the disk plane, reflecting thenon-spherical radiation field and non-uniform dust-free gas. Moreover, we foundthat the sublimation radius of $\theta \sim 20$-$60$ deg varies on a timescaleof several years. The ``inflow-induced outflow" contributes the obscuration ofthe nucleus in the sub-pc region. The column density of the dust-free gas is$N_{\rm H} \gtrsim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ for $r \lesssim 0.04$ pc. Gases near thedisk plane ($\theta \lesssim 30$ degree) can be the origin of the Compton-thickcomponent, which was suggested by the recent X-ray observations of AGNs. Thedusty outflow from the sub-pc region can be also a source of material for theradiation-driven fountain for a larger scale.  
Astrophysical cloaking of a naked singularity

  A massive naked singularity would be cloaked by accreted matter, and thus mayappear to a distant observer as an opaque \mbox{(quasi-)}spherical surface of afluid, not unlike that of a star or planet. We present here analyticalsolutions for levitating atmospheres around a wide class of sphericallysymmetric naked singularities. Such an atmosphere can be constructed in everyspacetime which possesses a zero-gravity radius and which is a solution of a(modified-)gravity theory possessing the usual conservation laws for matter.Its density peaks at the zero-gravity radius and the atmospheric fluid issupported against infall onto the singularity by gravity alone. In anastrophysical context, an opaque atmosphere would be formed in a very shorttime by accretion of ambient matter onto the singularity -- in a millisecondfor an X-ray binary, in a thousand seconds for a singularity traversinginterstellar space, and a thousand years for a singularity that is the centralengine of an AGN.  
Finding AGN remnant candidates based on radio morphology with machine

  Remnant radio galaxies represent the dying phase of radio-loud activegalactic nuclei (AGN). Large samples of remnant radio galaxies are importantfor quantifying the radio galaxy life cycle. The remnants of radio-loud AGN canbe identified in radio sky surveys based on their spectral index, or,complementary, through visual inspection based on their radio morphology.However, this is extremely time-consuming when applied to the new large andsensitive radio surveys. Here we aim to reduce the amount of visual inspectionrequired to find AGN remnants based on their morphology, through supervisedmachine learning trained on an existing sample of remnant candidates. For adataset of 4107 radio sources, with angular sizes larger than 60 arcsec, fromthe LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-Metre Sky Survey second data release(LoTSS-DR2), we started with 151 radio sources that were visually classified as'AGN remnant candidate'. We derived a wide range of morphological features forall radio sources from their corresponding Stokes-I images: from simple sourcecatalogue-derived properties, to clustered Haralick-features, andself-organising map (SOM) derived morphological features. We trained a randomforest classifier to separate the 'AGN remnant candidates' from the not yetinspected sources. The SOM-derived features and the total to peak flux ratio ofa source are shown to be most salient to the classifier. We estimate that$31\pm5\%$ of sources with positive predictions from our classifier will belabelled 'AGN remnant candidates' upon visual inspection, while we estimate theupper bound of the $95\%$ confidence interval for 'AGN remnant candidates' inthe negative predictions at $8\%$. Visual inspection of just the positivepredictions reduces the number of radio sources requiring visual inspection by$73\%$.  
A Gaussian process cross-correlation approach to time delay estimation
  in active galactic nuclei

  We present a probabilistic cross-correlation approach to estimate time delaysin the context of reverberation mapping (RM) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).We reformulate the traditional interpolated cross-correlation method as astatistically principled model that delivers a posterior distribution for thedelay. The method employs Gaussian processes as a model for observed AGN lightcurves. We describe the mathematical formalism and demonstrate the new approachusing both simulated light curves and available RM observations. The proposedmethod delivers a posterior distribution for the delay that accounts forobservational noise and the non-uniform sampling of the light curves. Thisfeature allow us to fully quantify its uncertainty and propagate it tosubsequent calculations of dependent physical quantities, e.g., black holemasses. It delivers out-of-sample predictions, which enables us to subject itto model selection and it can calculate the joint posterior delay for more thantwo light curves. Because of the numerous advantages of our reformulation andthe simplicity of its application, we anticipate that our method will findfavour not only in the specialised community of RM, but in all fields wherecross-correlation analysis is performed. We provide the algorithms and examplesof their application as part of our Julia GPCC package.  
CAvity DEtection Tool (CADET): Pipeline for automatic detection of X-ray
  cavities in hot galactic and cluster atmospheres

  The study of jet-inflated X-ray cavities provides a powerful insight into theenergetics of hot galactic atmospheres and radio-mechanical AGN feedback. Byestimating the volumes of X-ray cavities, the total energy and thus also thecorresponding mechanical jet power required for their inflation can be derived.Properly estimating their total extent is, however, non-trivial, prone tobiases, nearly impossible for poor-quality data, and so far has been donemanually by scientists. We present a novel and automated machine-learningpipeline called Cavity Detection Tool (CADET), developed to detect and estimatethe sizes of X-ray cavities from raw Chandra images. The pipeline consists of aconvolutional neural network trained for producing pixel-wise cavitypredictions and a DBSCAN clustering algorithm, which decomposes the predictionsinto individual cavities. The convolutional network was trained using mockobservations of early-type galaxies simulated to resemble real noisyChandra-like images. The network's performance has been tested on simulateddata obtaining an average cavity volume error of 14 % at an 89 % true-positiverate. For simulated images without any X-ray cavities inserted, we obtain a 5 %false-positive rate. When applied to real Chandra images, the pipelinerecovered 91 out of 100 previously known X-ray cavities in nearby early-typegalaxies and all 14 cavities in chosen galaxy clusters. Besides that, the CADETpipeline discovered 8 new cavity pairs in atmospheres of early-type galaxiesand galaxy clusters (IC4765, NGC533, NGC2300, NGC3091, NGC4073, NGC4125,NGC4472, NGC5129) and a number of potential cavity candidates.
