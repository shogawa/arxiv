  Early JWST observations have uncovered a new, substantial population of red sources that might represent a previously overlooked phase of actively growing supermassive black holes (Kocevski et al. 2023, Matthee et al. 2023, Labbe et al. 2023). One of the most intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object that was found to be triply-imaged by the strong lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (Furtak et al. 2023), allowing an unprecedented detailed look into this enigmatic population. Here we present deep spectroscopic JWST/NIRSpec observations of this object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three images are of the same object, and that it is a highly reddened ($A_V\sim3$) broad emission-line Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) at a redshift of $z_{\mathrm{spec}}=7.0451\pm0.0005$. From the width of H$\beta$ ($\mathrm{FWHM}=2800\pm250\,\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{s}}$) we derive a black hole mass of $M_{\mathrm{BH}}=3_{-1}^{+2}\times10^7\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We infer a very high ratio of black hole to galaxy mass of at least 3% and possibly as high as 100%, an order of magnitude or more than is seen in local galaxies. The lack of strong metal lines in the spectrum together with the high bolometric luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{bol}}=(1.1\pm0.3)\times10^{45}\,\frac{\mathrm{erg}}{\mathrm{s}}$) suggest that we are seeing the black hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting at 30% of the Eddington limit. Based on early JWST imaging studies we estimate that such heavily reddened, low-mass black holes can be $\sim100$ times more common than UV-selected ones at this epoch. The rapid growth and high black hole to galaxy mass ratio of A2744-QSO1 suggests that it may represent the missing link between black hole seeds (Inayoshi et al. 2020; Greene et al. 2020; Volonteri 2021) and the first luminous quasars (Fan et al. 2023).

  Combining the {\sc Cloudy} photoionization code with updated stellar population synthesis results, we simultaneously model the MIR $\neiii/\neii$ vs. $\oiv/\neiii$, the MIR-FIR $\neiii/\neii$ vs. $\oiv/\oiii$ and the classical BPT diagnostic diagrams. We focus on the properties of optically classified \hii\,galaxies that lie in the normal star forming zone in the MIR diagnostic diagram. We find that a small fraction of our models lie in this zone, but most of them correspond to the lowest explored metallicity, \zstar\,=\,0.0002, at age $\sim1$ Gyr. This value of \zstar\,is, by far, lower than the values derived for these galaxies from optical emission lines, suggesting that the far-UV emission produced by post-AGB stars (a.k.a. HOLMES, hot low-mass evolved stars) is NOT the source of ionization. Instead, shock models can easily reproduce this part of the MIR diagram. We suggest that it is likely that some of these galaxies have been misclassified and that in them, shocks, produced by a weak AGN-outflow, could be an important source of ionizaton. Using a subset of our models, we derive a new demarcation line for the maximal contribution of retired galaxies in the BPT diagram. This demarcation line allows for a larger contamination from the neighbouring AGN-dominated region. Considering the importance of disentangling the different ionising mechanisms in weak or deeply obscured systems, new observational efforts to classify galaxies both in the optical and IR are required to better constrain this kind of models and understand their evolutionary paths.   

Neutrinos from interactions between the relativistic jet and large-scale
  structures of BL Lac objects investigated through their gamma-ray spectrum

  Absorption and emission lines in the optical spectrum are typically used to investigate the presence of large-scale environments in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). BL Lac objects - which are a category of AGNs with the relativistic jet pointing directly to the observer - are supposed to represent a late evolution stage of AGNs. Their large-scale structures are probably poorer of material, which is distributed with lower densities throughout the circumnuclear environment. Their accretion disk is weak and weakly reprocessed, making the non-thermal continuum of the relativistic jet dominate their optical spectrum and preventing us from identifying the thermal emission of the photon fields produced by such large-scale structures. However, these photon fields may still exist and eventually interact with the gamma rays traveling in the blazar jet via gamma-gamma pair production, producing observable effects such as absorption features in their spectral energy distribution. Interestingly, the same photon field might also lead to the production of high-energy neutrinos, acting as targets for proton-photon interactions. In this contribution, we present the results of a set of simulations over a wide parameter space describing both the blazar jet and the photon field properties. We discuss the most effective conditions that may produce fluxes of neutrinos compatible with the sensitivities of the current and the next generation of neutrino detectors. We will also discuss how the possible neutrino flux would be related to the properties of the large-scale structures investigated indirectly through the analysis of the gamma-ray spectrum of the BL Lac object.   

A Colourful Analysis: Probing the Eclipse of the Black Hole and Central
  Engine in NGC 6814 Using X-ray Colour-Colour Grids

  Eclipsing of the X-ray emitting region in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a potentially powerful probe to examine the AGN environment and absorber properties. Here we study the eclipse data from the 2016 XMM-Newton observation of NGC 6814 using a colour-colour analysis. Colours (i.e. hardness ratios) can provide the advantage of better time-resolution over spectral analysis alone. Colour-colour grids are constructed to examine the effects of different parameters on the observed spectral variability during the eclipse. Consistent with previous spectral analysis, the variations are dominated by changes in the column density and covering fraction of the absorber. However, during maximum eclipse the behaviour of the absorber changes. Just after ingress, the eclipse is described by changes in column density and covering fraction, but prior to egress, the variations are dominated by changes in column density alone. Simulations are carried out to consider possible absorber geometries that might produce this behaviour. The behaviour is inconsistent with a single, homogeneous cloud, but simulations suggest that multiple clouds, perhaps embedded in a highly ionised halo, could reproduce the results. In addition, we determine the orbital covering factor (fraction of orbital path-length) based on evidence of several eclipses in the 2016, 64-day Swift light curve. We estimate that ~ 2-4 per cent of the orbit is covered by obscuring clouds and that the distribution of clouds is not isotropic.
