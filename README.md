  To investigate how the radio-identified active galactic nuclei (AGN) fraction varies with cluster-centric radius, we present the projected and de-projected distributions of a large sample of LOFAR-identified radio AGN out to $30R_{500}$ around galaxy clusters. The AGN fraction experiences a $\sim 25\%$ increase above the field fraction in the cluster outskirts at around $10R_{500}$, a $\sim 20\%$ decrease around $\sim 0.5R_{500}$, and an increase of over three times the field fraction value in the very cluster core. We label these three radial windows the outer, intermediate and inner regions respectively, and investigate how these radial trends might arise due to intrinsic properties of the AGN population. The only difference seen in host galaxy stellar mass is in the inner region, where there is a much higher fraction of massive host galaxies. Analysing AGN radio luminosity, regions with a higher AGN fraction tend to have more radio luminous AGN, and vice versa. We discuss the physical mechanisms that might be responsible for these results with reference to the literature.

  X-ray binaries (XRBs) exhibit spectral hysteresis for luminosities in the range $10^{-2}\lesssim L/L_\mathrm{Edd}\lesssim 0.3$, with a hard X-ray spectral state that persists from quiescent luminosities up to $\gtrsim 0.3L_\mathrm{Edd}$, transitioning to a soft spectral state that survives with decreasing luminosities down to $\sim 10^{-2}L_\mathrm{Edd}$. We present a possible approach to explain this behavior based on the thermal properties of a magnetically arrested disk simulation. By post-processing the simulation to include radiative effects, we solve for all the thermal equilibrium solutions as the accretion rate, $\dot{M}$, varies along the XRB outburst. For an assumed scaling of the disk scale height and accretion speed with temperature, we find that there exists two solutions in the range of $ 10^{-3}\lesssim\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Eddington} \lesssim 0.1$ at $r=8\:r_g$ ($ 4\times10^{-2}\lesssim\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Eddington} \lesssim 0.5$ at $r=3\:r_g$) : a cold, optically thick one and a hot, optically thin one. This opens the possibility of a natural thermal hysteresis in the right range of luminosities for XRBs. We stress that our scenario for the hysteresis does not require to invoke the strong-ADAF principle nor does it require for the magnetization of the disk to change along the XRB outburst. In fact, our scenario requires a highly magnetized disk in the cold, soft state to reproduce the soft-to-hard state transition at the right luminosities. Hence, a prediction of our scenario is that there should be a jet, although possibly very weakly dissipative, in the soft state of XRBs. We also predict that if active galactic nuclei (AGN) have similar hysteresis cycles and are strongly magnetized, they should undergo a soft-to-hard state transition at much lower $L/L_\mathrm{Edd}$ than XRBs.

  A ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems is their hard X-ray emission which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons in the vicinity of the black hole, in a region with optical depth of order unity. The origin and composition of this Comptonizing region, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. In this paper we investigate the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets for the pair enrichment and neutrino emission of AGN coronae. Our model has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. For sources with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \gtrsim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$ (where $\lambda_{\rm Edd, crit} \sim 10^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^5$ or $\sim 10^{-2}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^7$), proton-photon interactions and $ \gamma \gamma$ annihilation produce enough secondary pairs to achieve Thomson optical depths $\tau_{\rm T} \sim 0.1-10$. Additionally, we find that the neutrino luminosity scales as $L^2_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ for $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$, while it is proportional to $L_{\rm X}$ for higher $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ values. We apply our model to four Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 1068, and discuss our results in light of recent IceCube observations.

  Molecular gas is the key probe for the complex interaction between the accretion of black holes and star formation of the host galaxy of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The molecular gas discovered around the AGN indicates that this gas is providing fuel for the AGN. According to the theoretical model of the relativistic jet, the spin of a black hole enhances the relativistic jet of AGN. The spin of the black hole is used as an indicator of AGN activity. Therefore, we study the relationship between the activity of AGN and molecular gas. We find a significant strong correlation between molecular gas fraction and CO luminosity and black hole spin for the early-type galaxies. However, there is no correlation between molecular gas fraction and CO luminosity and black hole spin for the late-type galaxies. These results indicate that the spin of black holes mainly regulates the accretion of molecular gas in massive early-type galaxies. The activity of AGN depends on the amount of gas.

  We present deep Subaru/FOCAS spectra for two extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at $z\sim 1$ with strong {\sc[Oiii]}$\lambda$5007 emission lines, exhibiting equivalent widths (EWs) of $2905^{+946}_{-578}$ \AA\ and $2000^{+188}_{-159}$ \AA, comparable to those of EELGs at high redshifts that are now routinely identified with JWST spectroscopy. Adding a similarly large {\sc [Oiii]} EW ($2508^{+1487}_{-689}$ \AA) EELG found at $z\sim 2$ in the JWST CEERS survey to our sample, we explore for the physical origins of the large {\sc [Oiii]} EWs of these three galaxies with the Subaru spectra and various public data including JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI data. While there are no clear signatures of AGN identified by the optical line diagnostics, we find that two out of two galaxies covered by the MIRI data show strong near-infrared excess in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) indicating obscured AGN. Because none of the three galaxies show clear broad H$\beta$ lines, the upper limits on the flux ratios of broad-H$\beta$ to {\sc [Oiii]} lines are small, $\lesssim 0.15$ that are comparable with Seyfert $1.8-2.0$ galaxies. We conduct \texttt{Cloudy} modeling with the stellar and AGN incident spectra, allowing a wide range of parameters including metallicities and ionization parameters. We find that the large {\sc [Oiii]} EWs are not self-consistently reproduced by the spectra of stars or unobscured AGN, but obscured AGN that efficiently produces O$^{++}$ ionizing photons with weak nuclear and stellar continua that are consistent with the SED shapes.

  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the nearest massive galaxy to the Milky Way. Its circumgalactic medium is complex and multi-phase, containing both stripped HI structures like the Magellanic Stream and Bridge, and a diffuse warm corona seen in high-ion absorption. We analyze 28 AGN sightlines passing within 35 kpc of the LMC with archival HST/COS spectra to characterize the cool (T\approx10^4$ K) gas in the LMC CGM, via new measurements of UV absorption in six low ions (OI, FeII, SiII, AlII, SII, and NiII) and one intermediate ion (SiIII). We show that a declining column-density profile is present in all seven ions, with the low-ion profiles having a steeper slope than the high-ion profiles in CIV and SiIV reported by Krishnarao et al. 2022. Crucially, absorption at the LMC systemic velocity is only detected (in all ions) out to 17 kpc. Beyond this distance, the gas has a lower velocity and is associated with the Magellanic Stream. These results demonstrate that the LMC's CGM is composed of two distinct components: a compact inner halo extending to 17 kpc, and a more extended stripped region associated with the Stream. The compactness and truncation of the LMC's inner CGM agree with recent simulations of ram-pressure stripping of the LMC by the Milky Way's extended corona.

  We present the all-sky catalogue of absolute positions and estimates of correlated flux density of 21,942 compact radio sources determined from processing interferometric visibility data of virtually all VLBI observing sessions at 2 to 23 GHz from 72 programs suitable for absolute astrometry collected for 30 years. We used a novel technique of generation of a dataset of fused observables that allowed us to incorporate all available data in our analysis. The catalogue is the most complete and most precise to date. It forms the foundation and reference for positional astronomy, space geodesy, space navigation, population analysis of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and provides calibrators for phase-referencing for differential astrometry and VLBI astrophysical observations. Its accuracy was evaluated through a detailed accounting systematic errors, rigorous decimation tests, comparison of different datasets, and comparison with other catalogues. The catalogue samples preferentially the AGNs with a strong contemporary parsec-scale synchrotron emission. Its milliarcsecond level positional accuracy allows association of these AGNs with detections in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from low-frequency radio to gamma-rays and high energy neutrinos. We describe the innovative data processing and calibration technique in full detail, report the in depth analysis of random and systematic positional errors, and provide the list of associations with large surveys at different wavelengths.

  The fraction of dwarf galaxies hosting central, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at low redshifts is an important observational probe of black hole seeding at high redshift. Detections of nuclear accretion signatures in dwarf galaxies provides strong evidence for the presence of these IMBHs. We develop a Bayesian model to infer the black hole occupation fraction assuming a broken power law Eddington ratio distribution function. Our approach accounts for non-detections, incompleteness, and contamination from star-forming-related emission. We apply this model to galaxies with X-ray data from the Chandra Source Catalog at distances $&lt;50$ Mpc, radio data from the VLA Sky Survey at $&lt; 50$ Mpc, and optical variability data from the Palomar Transient Factory at $z&lt;0.055$. We find a black hole occupation fraction of at least $90$ percent at stellar masses of $M_{\star}=10^8~M_{\odot}$ and at least $39$ percent at $M_{\star} = 10^7~M_{\odot}$ (95\% confidence intervals). We show the resulting black hole mass function. These constraints on the IMBH population have implications for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission and for cosmological models of black hole seeding and growth. We also constrain the extremely low luminosity end ($L_{\rm{bol}}\lesssim10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the AGN luminosity functions at $z=0$. Our AGN luminosity functions are broadly consistent with an extrapolation of the shallow slope of the AGN luminosity functions from previous work.

  Near-infrared (NIR) emission is less affected by dust than UV and optical emission and is therefore useful for studying the properties of dust-obscured galaxies. Although rest-frame NIR observations of high-redshift galaxies have long been made using space telescopes, their structures were unresolved due to the lack of angular resolution. This letter reports the early results from the analysis of high-resolution Pa$\beta$ imaging of the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$ with the JWST Near Infrared Camera. We investigate radial profiles of Pa$\beta$ lines and rest-frame NIR continua from luminous H$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (HAEs) in the protocluster. Particularly, we compare those of 11 HAEs (N-HAEs) on the star-forming main sequence with those of 8 HAEs (X-HAEs) with X-ray AGNs. Resultant composite Pa$\beta$ line images of N-HAEs indicate significant star formation in galactic disks. In contrast, X-HAEs are dominated by point source components rather than outer star formation, as inferred from our earlier work based on multi-wavelength SED fitting. Given their higher stellar potentials suggested from their rest-frame NIR images, the different characteristics may be driven by the impact of AGN feedback.

  We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM follow-up of candidate galaxies at z=9-11 selected from deep JWST/NIRCam photometry in GLASS-JWST Early Release Science data. We spectroscopically confirm six sources with secure redshifts at z = 9.52-10.43, each showing multiple emission lines. An additional object is likely at z = 10.66, based on its Lya-break and a single emission feature, while one source is a lower redshift interloper. The sample includes the first JWST-detected candidate at z=10, GHZ1/GLASS-z10, which we confirm at z = 9.875, and the X-ray detected AGN GHZ9 confirmed at z = 10.145. Three objects in our sample, including GHZ9, have EW(CIII])&gt;20A and occupy a region compatible with AGN emission in the EW(CIII]) vs CIV/CIII] diagram. The spectroscopic sample confirms a high abundance of galaxies at z &gt; 9. We measure a number density of z=10 galaxies in the GLASS-JWST ERS field that is a factor of &gt;3 higher than other JWST-based estimates at demagnified rest-frame magnitudes of -21 &lt; Muv &lt; -19. We find that the positions of these galaxies in redshift and angular space are not consistent with all of them being part of a unique progenitor of present-day galaxy clusters. The high density of objects in the GLASS region can be explained either by clustering on large scales or by a superposition of different forming structures of which we observe only the brightest members. By considering all the spectroscopic z=10 sources in the Abell-2744 field, we identify two potential galaxy proto-clusters centered around GHZ9 and JD1, with relative separations between their members of 1-2 pMpc. The potential AGN nature of three of the sources in our sample lends support to a scenario in which the high abundance of bright sources determined by JWST surveys at cosmic dawn may be affected by AGN contribution to their UV luminosity.

  We present the first spectroscopic confirmation of a dust-obscured dwarf galaxy, CEERS-14821.   The analysis is performed combining JWST NIRCam broad-band photometry and NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopic data. From the detection of multiple rest-frame optical lines, we derive that CEERS-14821 is located at $z=4.883\pm0.003$. Moreover, from a secure detection of the $H_{\alpha}$ and $H_{\beta}$ we derived that the galaxy has a dust extinction ranging from Av=2.2 to Av=3.3, depending on the assumed reddening law. This value is extremely large given that we estimated a low stellar mass around log(M/Mo)=8.0-8.2. Moreover, using different metallicity tracers, we verify that the galaxy is also metal-rich, with 12+log(O/H)&gt;8.3. This is well above the expectation from both the mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental mass-metalliticy relation. CEERS-14821 is going through a burst of star formation, there are no indications of a strong contribution from an active galactic nuclei (f(AGN)&lt;0.5 with respect to the total dust luminosity). Based on the rest-frame optical images, this source has a size compatible with galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift. Finally, with the current data, it seems that there are galaxies closely interacting with CEERS-14821.

  A fundamental ingredient in the unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is the obscuring torus, whose innermost, hottest region dominates the near infrared (NIR) emission. Characterising the change in the torus properties and its interplay with the main AGN emission is key for our understanding of AGN physics, evolution and classification. Its covering factor ($CF$) is largely responsible for the classification of AGN on the basis of the detection of broad emission lines. It is still not clear whether the torus properties evolve over time and how they relate with the accretion parameters of the nucleus. In this work, we aim at investigating the evolution of the NIR properties with the redshift ($z$) and the bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) of the AGN. To this end, we assembled a large dataset of $\sim$36,000 Type 1 AGN between $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.9$ and $45.0&lt;\log(L_{\rm bol} / (\rm erg / s))&lt;48.0$ with UV, optical and near-infrared photometry. We produced average spectral energy distributions (SED) in different bins of the $z-L_{\rm bol}$ parameter space to estimate how the NIR SED evolves according to these parameters. We find that the NIR luminosity decreases for increasing $L_{\rm bol}$ at any redshift. At the same, time the shape of the NIR SED in our sample is consistent with a non-evolution with $z$. As a consequence, all the explored proxies for the $CF$ exhibit significant anti-correlations with $L_{\rm bol}$, but not with $z$. Additionally, the $CF$ also shows a shallower anti-correlation with the Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$), yet current systematic uncertainties, as well as the limited dynamical range, do not allow us to precisely constrain the role of the Eddington ratio. Lastly, we derived the covering factor from the ratio between the NIR and optical luminosity and we employed it to set a lower limit for the X-ray obscuration at different redshifts.
