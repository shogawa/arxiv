  It is generally thought that AGN optical variability is produced, at least in part, by reprocessing of central X-rays by a surrounding accretion disc, resulting in wavelength-dependent lags between bands. Any good model of AGN optical variability should explain not only these lags, but also the overall pattern of variability as quantified by the power spectral density (PSD). Here we present $\sim$daily g'-band monitoring of the low-mass AGN NGC\,4395 over 3 years. Together with previous TESS and GTC/HiPERCAM observations we produce an optical PSD covering an unprecedented frequency range of $\sim7$ decades allowing excellent determination of PSD parameters. The PSD is well fitted by a bending power law with low-frequency slope $\alpha_{L} = 1.0 \pm 0.2$, high-frequency slope $2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.4}$ and bend timescale $3.0^{+6.6}_{-1.7}\,$\,d. This timescale is close to that derived previously from a damped random walk (DRW) model fitted to just the TESS observations, although $\alpha_{L}$ is too steep to be consistent with a DRW. We compare the observed PSD with one made from light curves synthesized assuming reprocessing of X-rays, as observed by \xmm and Swift, in a disc defined by the observed lags. The simulated PSD is also well described by a bending power law but with a bend two decades higher in frequency. We conclude that the large-amplitude optical variations seen on long-timescales are not due to disc reprocessing but require a second source of variability whose origin is unknown but could be propagating disc accretion rate variations.

  We present results from a high cadence multi-wavelength observational campaign of the enigmatic changing look AGN 1ES 1927+654 from May 2022- April 2024, coincident with an unprecedented radio flare (an increase in flux by a factor of $\sim 60$ over a few months) and the emergence of a spatially resolved jet at $0.1-0.3$ pc scales (Meyer et al. 2024). Companion work has also detected a recurrent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the $2-10$ keV band with an increasing frequency ($1-2$ mHz) over the same period (Masterson et al., 2025). During this time, the soft X-rays ($0.3-2$ keV) monotonically increased by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the UV emission remained near-steady with $&lt;30\%$ variation and the $2-10$ keV flux showed variation by a factor $\lesssim 2$. The weak variation of the $2-10$ keV X-ray emission and the stability of the UV emission suggest that the magnetic energy density and accretion rate are relatively unchanged, and that the jet could be launched due to a reconfiguration of the magnetic field (toroidal to poloidal) close to the black hole. Advecting poloidal flux onto the event horizon would trigger the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism, leading to the onset of the jet. The concurrent softening of the coronal slope (from $\Gamma= 2.70\pm 0.04$ to $\Gamma=3.27\pm 0.04$), the appearance of a QPO, and low coronal temperature ($kT_{e}=8_{-3}^{+8}$ keV) during the radio outburst suggest that the poloidal field reconfiguration can significantly impact coronal properties and thus influence jet dynamics. These extraordinary findings in real time are crucial for coronal and jet plasma studies, particularly as our results are independent of coronal geometry.
