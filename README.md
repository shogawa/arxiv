  After exploring the infrared softness diagram to characterize the hardness of the incident ionizing radiation in star-forming regions, we exploit the availability of high-excitation lines in the same spectral regime to explore its use for studying the narrow-line regions in AGN. We adapted the IR softness diagram to consider very high-excitation lines, such as [Ne V] 14.3,24.3 $\mu$m or [O IV] 25.9$\mu$m. The measured emission-line ratios were included as inputs for the code HCm-Teff-IR, in order to provide a quantification for both the ionization and the $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ parameters. The latter is sensitive to the spectral shape of the incident continuum in AGN. We applied this to a large AGN sample including different spectral types with available Spitzer/IRS, Herschel/PACS and/or SOFIA/FIFI-LS mid-IR spectroscopic observations. The combination of the ([Ne II] 12.8 $\mu$m+[Ne III] 15.6$\mu$m)/[Ne V] 14.3$\mu$m and [O III] 52,88 $\mu$m/[O IV] 25.9$\mu$m emission line ratios is a robust proxy for the shape of the ionizing continuum in AGN. An alternative based on the [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m+[S IV] 10.5$\mu$m lines can be used instead. The inclusion of very high-excitation lines in HCm-Teff-IR, to derive both $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and $U$ for the studied sample, points to a bimodal distribution of galaxies. One of the peaks is characterized by relatively harder values of $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ around -1.4 in combination with low values for log $U$ around -2.4, while the other peak shows a softer $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ around -1.7 and high values of log $U$ around-1.5. This result is consistent with the existence of two very marked AGN populations., one with a softer ionizing continuum, possibly dominated by a radiatively efficient accretion disk in bright Seyfert nuclei. In contrast, we observe a harder radiation field in low-luminosity AGN, where the accretion disk is expected to recede.

  We present the results of an Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) 944 MHz and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) 3~GHz search for a radio-continuum counterpart of the recent ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event, KM3-230213A. Using (ASKAP), we catalog 1052 radio sources within the 1.5$^\circ$ radius search area (68% certainty region) around the particle's calculated origin, 10 of which we classify as blazar candidates based on their radio spectra. The most prominent radio source in the search area is the nearby spiral galaxy UGCA 127 (nicknamed Phaedra, From Greek: $\phi\alpha i\delta\rho\alpha$, a Cretan princess of Greek Mythology, derived from Phaidros, Greek: ${\phi}{\alpha}{\iota}{\delta}{\rho}o{\varsigma}$, meaning 'bright'.). Its non-thermal radio spectrum classifies it as a non-blazar active galactic nucleus (AGN). We also present an extended radio source, WISEA J061715.89-075455.4 (nicknamed Hebe, From Greek: $H{\beta}{\eta}$, the Greek goddess of youth.), located only ~7' from the geometric center of the search area, with a very unusual highly polarized compact component. Finally, we present a strong radio source, EMU J062248-072246 (nicknamed Narcissus, From Greek $N{\alpha}{\rho}{\kappa}{\iota}{\sigma}{\sigma}o{\zeta}$ was a self-absorbed hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia.), which has a maximum self-absorption spectral slope of +2.5 at low frequencies, and exhibits ~25% flux density variability over the ~5-year VLASS 3~GHz survey.

  Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN) represent a unique class of AGN in the local universe. Extensive studies of these objects are essential for a comprehensive understanding of jet physics, as past research has largely focused on more powerful radio sources. In this report, we present our recent VLBI studies of two prominent nearby LLAGN, NGC 4261 and M104 (the Sombrero galaxy). Specifically, we address the kinematics, collimation, and fundamental physical parameters of their jets, and probe the possible origin of the radio emission at millimeter wavelengths.

  Over the last years, a number of broadband reverberation mapping campaigns have been conducted to explore the short-term UV and optical variability of nearby AGN. Despite the extensive data collected, the origin of the observed variability is still debated in the literature. Frequency-resolved time lags offer a promising approach to distinguish between different scenarios, as they probe variability on different time scales. In this study, we present the expected frequency-resolved lags resulting from X-ray reprocessing in the accretion disk. The predicted lags are found to feature a general shape that resembles that of observational measurements, while exhibiting strong dependence on various physical parameters. Additionally, we compare our model predictions to observational data for the case of NGC 5548, concluding that the X-ray illumination of the disk can effectively account for the observed frequency-resolved lags and power spectra in a self-consistent way. To date, X-ray disk reprocessing is the only physical model that has successfully reproduced the observed multi-wavelength variability, in both amplitude and time delays, across a range of temporal frequencies.

  Mrk 590 is a Changing Look AGN currently in an unusual repeat X-ray and UV flaring state. Here, we report on deep X-ray observations with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and NICER, obtained at a range of X-ray flux levels. We detect a prominent soft excess below 2 keV; its flux is tightly correlated with that of both the X-ray and UV continuum, and it persists at the lowest flux levels captured. Our Bayesian model comparison strongly favors inverse Comptonization as the origin of this soft excess, instead of blurred reflection. We find only weak reflection features, with R~0.4 assuming Compton-thick reflection. Most of this reprocessing occurs at least $\sim$800 gravitational radii (roughly three light-days) from the continuum source. Relativistically broadened emission is weak or absent, suggesting the lack of a standard `thin disk' at small radii. We confirm that the predicted broad-band emission due to Comptonization is roughly consistent with the observed UV--optical photometry. This implies an optically thick, warm ($kT_e\sim0.3$ keV) scattering region that extends to at least $\sim10^3$ gravitational radii, reprocessing any UV thermal emission. The lack of a standard `thin disk' may also explain the puzzling $\sim3$-day X-ray to UV delay previously measured for Mrk 590. Overall, we find that the X-ray spectral changes in Mrk 590 are minimal, despite substantial luminosity changes. Other well-studied changing look AGN display more dramatic spectral evolution, e.g., disappearing continuum or soft excess. This suggests that a diversity of physical mechanisms in the inner accretion flow may produce a UV--optical changing-look event.

  In the context of the life cycle and evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN), the environment plays an important role. In particular, the over-dense environments of galaxy groups, where dynamical interactions and bulk motions have significant impact, offer an excellent but under-explored window into the life cycles of AGN and the processes that shape the evolution of relativistic plasma. Pilot Survey observations with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey recovered diffuse emission associated with the nearby (z = 0.0228) galaxy group HCG15, which was revealed to be strongly linearly polarised. We study the properties of this emission in unprecedented detail to settle open questions about its nature and its relation to the group-member galaxies. We perform a multi-frequency spectropolarimetric study of HCG15 incorporating our ASKAP EMU observations as well as new data from MeerKAT, LOFAR, the GMRT, and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), plus X-ray data from XMM-Newton and optical spectra from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). Our study confirms that the diffuse structure represents remnant emission from historic AGN activity, likely associated with HCG15-D, some 80-86 Myr ago (based on ageing analysis). We detect significant highly linearly-polarised emission from a diffuse 'ridge'-like structure with a highly ordered magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that this emission is generated by draping of magnetic field lines in the intra-group medium (IGrM), although further exploration with simulations would aid our understanding. We confirm that HCG15-C is a group-member galaxy. Finally, we report the detection of thermal emission associated with a background cluster at redshift z ~ 0.87 projected onto the IGrM of HCG15, which matches the position and redshift of the recent SZ detection of ACT-CL J0207.8+0209.

  Mid-infrared (MIR) emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) is a powerful probe of the circumnuclear environment around dormant supermassive black holes. This emission arises from the reprocessing of intrinsic emission into thermal MIR emission by circumnuclear dust. While the majority of optical- and X-ray-selected TDEs show only weak dust echoes consistent with primarily unobscured sight lines, there have been growing efforts aimed at finding TDEs in obscured environments using MIR selection methods. In this work, we present the first JWST observations of 4 MIR-selected TDEs with JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS). Two of these sources show flares in other wavelength bands (one in optical, one in X-ray), while the other two are MIR-only transients. None of these TDEs showed pre-outburst nuclear activity, but all of the MIRI/MRS observations reveal emission lines associated with highly ionized gas, implying ionization from TDE accretion. Additionally, all four sources show silicate emission features around 10 and 18 $\mu$m that are much stronger than the features seen in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We suggest that the emitting dust is optically thin to its own emission and show that the MIR spectrum is consistent with emission from optically thin dust along an isodelay surface. All four sources show an excess at short wavelengths ($\lambda &lt; 8\, \mu$m), which could arise from a late-time plateau in the intrinsic flare, akin to what is seen in late-time UV observations of unobscured TDEs, although self-consistent dust modeling is required to fully assess the strength of this late-time plateau.

  The high-frequency radio sky is bursting with synchrotron transients from massive stellar explosions and accretion events, but the low-frequency radio sky has so far been quiet beyond the Galactic pulsar population and the long-term scintillation of AGN. The low-frequency band, however, is sensitive to exotic coherent and polarised radio emission processes such as electron cyclotron maser emission from flaring M-dwarfs [1], stellar magnetospheric plasma interactions with exoplanets [2], and a population of steep-spectrum pulsars [3], making Galactic plane searches a prospect for blind transient discovery. Here we report an analysis of archival low-frequency radio data that reveals a periodic, low-frequency radio transient. We find that the source pulses every 18.18 minutes, an unusual periodicity not previously observed. The emission is highly linearly polarised, bright, persists for 30--60 s on each occurrence, and is visible across a broad frequency range. At times the pulses comprise short ($&lt;0.5$-s) duration bursts; at others, a smoother profile is observed. These profiles evolve on timescales of hours. By measuring the dispersion of the radio pulses with respect to frequency, we have localised the source to within our own Galaxy, and suggest that it could be an ultra-long period magnetar.

  Quasars, powered by supermassive black holes (SMBH), are among the brightest objects in the universe. In the vicinity of an SMBH, X-ray photons from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can heat the surrounding gas to several hundred kelvin. Here we report observations of dust continuum and CO J=13-12 and J=14-13 line emissions at a resolution of 130 parsecs in a luminous quasar at z=6. We successfully detected these high-J CO line emissions from warm gas in a compact disk component. The CO luminosity ratio in the central region of the compact disk is consistent with theoretical models in which X-ray heating dominates the CO excitation and the gas column density is as high as 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. This demonstrates that high-resolution observations of high-J CO lines are promising ways to identify extremely dust-obscured quasars in the early universe.

  We analyze the X-ray and radio properties of the galaxy cluster Abell 2009 (z=0.152) to complete the in-depth study of a subsample of objects from the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample with relatively high X-ray flux and H$\alpha$ line luminosity, which is a promising diagnostic of the presence of cool gas in the cluster cores. Our aim is to investigate the feedback from the AGN in the central galaxy and the ICM of relaxed clusters. In this work, we analyze archival data from JVLA and Chandra observations. We performed a morphological analysis of both the X-ray emission from the ICM of Abell 2009 and the radio emission from the AGN in the central galaxy. We also performed a spectral analysis of the X-ray emission to derive the global properties and radial profiles of the thermal gas. Our X-ray analysis confirms the expectations, based on the selection criteria, that Abell 2009 is a cool-core system. We estimate a cooling radius of 88 kpc within which the ICM is radiating its energy at rates of $L_{cool} \sim 4.4 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Radio observations of the central galaxy reveal a bright core surrounded by radio lobes on 30 kpc scales with a symmetric butterfly-shaped morphology. Although we did not detect any X-ray cavity at the position of the central radio lobes, we combined the volume of the lobes with the pressure of the surrounding ICM to derive the work done by the AGN on the gas to inflate them. By estimating a cavity age of about 20 Myr, this corresponds to a mechanical power of $\approx 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ which is sufficient to counterbalance the radiative cooling losses in Abell 2009. We finally discuss possible correlations between the global properties of the 18 objects from the BCS selection, finding in particular that the number of outbursts required to counterbalance the radiative ICM losses is linearly anticorrelated with the energy and power of the outburst.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is one of the most important mechanisms in galaxy evolution. It is usually found in massive galaxies and regulates star formation. Although dwarf galaxies are assumed to be regulated by supernova feedback, recent studies show evidence for the presence of AGN outflows and feedback in dwarf galaxies. We investigate the presence of AGN outflows in a sample of 2292 dwarf galaxies with AGN signatures drawn from the MaNGA survey. Thanks to the integral field unit data from MaNGA we are able to spatially resolve these outflows and study their kinematics and energetics. Using the GELATO Python code, we fit the AGN-stacked spectrum of each galaxy, which is the stack of all the spaxels classified as AGN by emission line diagnostic diagrams, and in particular the [OIII]$\lambda$5007\AA\ emission line. If the galaxies show a broad [OIII] emission line component in the stacked spectrum, we run GELATO through all the spaxels that are classified as AGN in the emission line diagnostic diagrams. We find 11 new dwarf galaxies that present outflow signatures based on the presence of a broad [OIII] emission line component. Their velocity W$_{80}$ (width containing 80$\%$ of the flux of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007\AA\ emission line) ranges from 205 to 566 km s$^{-1}$ and the kinetic energy rate ranges from $\sim10^{35}$ to $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Stellar processes are unlikely to explain these outflow kinetic energy rates in the case of seven dwarf galaxies. We find a correlation between the W$_{80}$ velocity and the [OIII] luminosity and between the kinetic energy rate of the outflow and the bolometric luminosity spanning from massive to dwarf galaxies. This suggests a similar behavior between the AGN outflows in the dwarf galaxy population with those in massive galaxies.

  (abridged) To understand early star formation, it is essential to determine the dust mass budget of high-redshift galaxies. Sub-millimeter rest-frame emission, dominated by cold dust, is an unbiased tracer of dust mass. The NIKA2 camera conducted a deep blank field survey at 1.2 and 2.0 mm in the GOODS-N field as part of the NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS), detecting 65 sources with SNR&gt;=4.2. Thanks to a dedicated interferometric program with NOEMA and other high-angular resolution data, we identify the multi-wavelength counterparts of these sources and resolve them into 71 individual galaxies. We build detailed SEDs and assign a redshift to 68 of them, over the range 0.6&lt;z&lt;7.2. We fit these SEDs using MBB and Draine &amp; Li (2007) models, and the panchromatic approaches MAGPHYS, CIGALE, and SED3FIT, thus deriving their dust mass, M(dust), infrared luminosity (LIR), and stellar mass, M(star). Eight galaxies require an AGN-torus component and other six require an unextinguished young stellar population. A significant fraction of our galaxies are classified as starbursts based on their position on the M(star) versus SFR plane or their depletion timescales. We compute the dust mass function in three redshift bins (1.6&lt;z&lt;=2.4, 2.4&lt;z&lt;=4.2 and 4.2&lt;z&lt;=7.2) and determine the Schechter function that best describes it. We observe an increase of the dust cosmic density, rho(dust), by at least an order of magnitude from z~7 to z~1.5, consistent with theoretical predictions. At lower redshift the evolution flattens; significant differences exist between results obtained with different selections and methods. The superb GOODS-N dataset enabled a systematic investigation into the dust properties of distant galaxies. N2CLS holds promise for combining these deep field findings with the wide COSMOS field into a self-consistent analysis of dust in galaxies both near and far.
