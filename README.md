  We explore the massive cluster XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at z about 1.46 with MUSE and KMOS integral field spectroscopy. Using MUSE spectroscopy we trace the kinematics of the ionized gas using [OII] in the central 500x500 square kpc area of the cluster, which contains 28 spectroscopically identified cluster galaxies. We detect [OII] emission lines in the integrated spectra of 21 galaxies with the remaining seven being passive galaxies. Six of these passive galaxies lie in the cluster central part with a diameter of 200 kpc which contains no star-forming objects, being a place where star-formation in galaxies is quenched. An interesting discovery in this central area of the cluster are three diffuse ionized [OII] gas structures, which we refer as [OII] blobs, extending over areas of hundreds of square kpc. The source of ionization of one of the gaseous structures which displays two prominent filamentary patterns indicating outflow of gas is an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The KMOS data enabled us to use the BPT diagram to identify this object as a type-2 AGN. The other two diffuse ionized oxygen gaseous structures are more enigmatic, being located between the stellar components of passive cluster galaxies; one of these blobs does not have any stellar counterpart in the HST optical and near-infrared data, and the other only a very faint counterpart. Ram-pressure stripping of photo-ionized gas or AGN feedback could be an explanation. Additionally, the galaxy velocity distribution in this high redshift cluster is bimodal indicating that the cluster is unlikely to be fully virialized, and that recent and ongoing merging events producing shocks could provide photo-ionization sources for the two enigmatic [OII] blobs.

  A sample of 312 low-frequency peaked BL Lacertae objects (LBLs) and 694 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) with the parameters both redshift and $\gamma$-ray photon spectral index ($\Gamma _\gamma$) is compiled from the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) Catalog Data Release 2 (4LAC-DR2) from Fermi-LAT. The multi-wavelength data of the sample sources are downloaded from the Space Science Data Center (SSDC), and then match the corresponding gamma-ray data from 4FGL-DR2. The synchrotron radiation peak frequency and Compton dominance (CD) parameters of the sources are obtained by using a log-parabolic to fit the average-state multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution. A support vector machine (SVM) in the $\log L_\gamma$-$\Gamma_\gamma$ frame is utilized to delineate the optimal boundary between FSRQs and LBLs sources. The 1$\sigma$ position of the Gaussian fitting on the histograms of the $\Gamma_\gamma$, $\log \nu^{syn}_{peak}$, and CD parameter distributions are also introduced. In the criterion, 25 FSRQ candidates are selected from LBL sample sources. The optical spectral identification result confirms that 8 out of 13 candidate sources available with the optical spectral data exhibit the relationship of $EW &gt; 5 \mathring{\mathrm{A}}$.

  Double-peaked emission lines are observed in a few percent of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and allow the determination of properties of the line-emitting region, known as the broad-line region (BLR). We investigate the structure and kinematics of the BLR in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4593 through an analysis of the NIR line blend of Ca II 8498, 8542, 8662 and O I 8446 observed in a 2019 VLT/MUSE spectrum. We perform a detailed decomposition of the near-infrared Ca II triplet and O I 8446 blend, extracting clean profiles of Ca II 8498, 8542, 8662 and O I 8446. We then fit Ca 8662 with a relativistic elliptical line-emitting disk model. The line profiles are double-peaked with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of approx. 3700 km/s and exhibit a redward asymmetry with a red-to-blue peak ratio of 4:3. The Ca ii triplet lines have an intensity ratio of 1:1:1 and show no evidence of a central narrow or intermediate-width component. The profiles of Ca II and O I are remarkably similar, suggesting a common region of origin. Given the 1:1:1 ratio of the Ca II triplet, this region is likely a high-density emission zone, and the Ca II 8662 profile is well described by a mildly eccentric, low-inclination relativistic disk with minimal internal turbulence. The profile represents one of the clearest kinematic signatures of a relativistic disk observed in BLR emission lines to date. The double-peaked profiles of the NIR Ca II triplet and O I 8446 in NGC 4593 represent the first detection of double-peaked Ca II and O I 8446 in a non-transient AGN spectrum. The minimal intrinsic turbulence -- the lowest value reported for an AGN emission line to date -- and absence of narrow or intermediate-width components in Ca II 8662 make it a powerful diagnostic tool of BLR structure and kinematics. Further investigations of the profiles of Ca II and O I in other AGN are warranted to better constrain BLR properties.
