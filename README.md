  We report the discovery of the 10 kilo-parsec (kpc) scale radio lobes in the Sombrero galaxy (NGC 4594), using data from the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies - an Expanded Very Large Array (VLA) Survey (CHANG-ES) project. We further examine the balance between the magnetic pressure inside the lobes and the thermal pressure of the ambient hot gas. At the radii $r$ of ~(1-10) kpc, the magnetic pressure inside the lobes and the thermal pressure of the ambient hot gas are generally in balance. This implies that the jets could expand into the surroundings at least to r ~ 10 kpc. The feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet responsible for the large-scale lobes may help to explain the unusually high X-ray luminosity of this massive quiescent isolated disk galaxy, although more theoretical work is needed to further examine this possibility.

  Sky distributions of large samples of distant active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have shown dipoles significantly larger than the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole. However, a recent Bayesian analysis of the QUAIA sample, comprising 1.3 million quasars, has yielded a dipole that seems to be in tandem with the CMB dipole, in contravention of most previous studies of AGN dipoles. Since the question has large cosmological implications, we investigate the QUAIA quasar sample afresh, by directly computing the dipole from asymmetries observed in the source number counts. We instead find a dipole 3-4 times as large as the CMB dipole though in the same direction. Further, it has been claimed elsewhere that the difference between the CMB dipole and the radio dipole estimated from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the first large catalogue that showed an AGN dipole about four times larger than the CMB dipole, can be fully accounted for by incorporating the shot-noise and clustering contributions to the total NVSS dipole. A careful reinvestigation of the NVSS dipole, however, shows that the random phenomena like shot noise or clustering cannot account for the actually observed NVSS asymmetries, which show a systematic dipole pattern over the sky.

  We analyse a Chandra observation of the rich globular cluster NGC 362, finding 33 X-ray sources within 1' (1.2 half-mass radii) of the cluster center. Spectral analysis of the brightest source (X1) shows blackbody-like emission, indicating it is likely a quiescent low-mass X-ray binary; we find a possible counterpart that falls in the sub-subgiant region. We use HST UV Globular Cluster Survey (HUGS) photometry to identify 15 potential optical/UV counterparts to these X-ray sources, including two background AGN. We identify no likely CVs, probably due to crowding in optical filters in the core, though we predict of order 8 CVs among the detected X-ray sources. We identify three other sub-subgiants and two red straggler counterparts, which are likely powered by coronal activity, along with five other potential coronally active binary counterparts to three X-ray sources. Finally, we note two unusual counterpart candidates that lie to the red of the red giant branch in V_606 - I_814, and shift well to the blue of the red giant branch in ultraviolet colour-magnitude diagrams. These systems seem to contain a red giant with a distorted evolutionary history, plus a bright blue light source, either a blue straggler star (an Algol-like system) or an accreting white dwarf (a long-period CV, or a symbiotic star).

  We report first results from a deep near infrared campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain late-epoch images of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), 10-15 years after the first epoch data were obtained. The main objectives are to search for faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts by virtue of their photometric variability, and measure (or constrain) the comoving number density of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), n_SMBH, at early times. In this Letter we present a brief overview of the program and preliminary results regarding eight objects. Three variables are supernovae, two of which are apparently hostless with indeterminable redshifts, although one has previously been recorded at a z\approx 6 galaxy. Two further objects are clear AGN candidates at z=2.0 and 3.2, based on morphology and/or spectroscopy, in particular infrared spectroscopy from JWST. Three variable targets are identified at z=6-7, which are also likely AGN candidates. These sources provide a first measure of n_SMBH in the reionization epoch by photometric variability, which places a firm lower limit of 3x10^{-4} cMpc^{-3}. After accounting for variability and luminosity incompleteness, we estimate n_SMBH \gtrsim 8x10^{-3} cMpc^{-3}, which is the largest value so far reported at these redshifts. This SMBH abundance is also strikingly similar to estimates of n_SMBH in the local Universe. We discuss how these results test various theories for SMBH formation.

  and AGN-host galaxies

  Galaxies' stellar masses, gas-phase oxygen abundances (metallicity), and star formation rates (SFRs) obey a series of empirical correlations, most notably the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relation (FZR), which relates oxygen abundance to a combination of stellar mass and SFR. However, due to the difficulty of measuring oxygen abundances and SFRs in galaxies that host powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN), to date it is unknown to what extent AGN-host galaxies also follow these correlations. In this work, we apply Bayesian methods to the MaNGA integral field spectrographic (IFS) survey that allow us to measure oxygen abundances and SFRs in AGN hosts, and use these measurements to explore how the MZR and FZR differ between galaxies that do and do not host AGN. We find similar MZRs at stellar masses above $10^{10.5} \mathrm{M}_\odot$, but that at lower stellar masses AGN hosts show up to $\sim 0.2$ dex higher oxygen abundances. The offset in the FZR is significantly smaller, suggesting that the larger deviation in the MZR is a result of AGN-host galaxies having systematically lower SFRs at fixed stellar mass. However, within the AGN-host sample there is little correlation between SFR and oxygen abundance. These findings support a scenario in which an AGN can halt efficient gas accretion, which drives non-AGN host galaxies to both higher SFR and lower oxygen abundance, resulting in the galaxy evolving off the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). As a consequence, as the SFR declines for an individual system its metallicity remains mostly unchanged.

  Intensity interferometry is a technique developed many decades ago, that has recently enjoyed a renaissance thanks in part to advances in photodetector technology. We investigate the potential for long-baseline optical intensity interferometry to observe bright, active galactic nuclei (AGN) associated with rapidly accreting supermassive black holes. We argue that realistic telescope arrays similar in area to existing Cherenkov arrays, if equipped with modern high-precision single photon detectors, can achieve a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio not only to detect distant AGN, but also to study them in great detail. We explore the science potential of such observations by considering two examples. First, we find that intensity interferometric observations of bright nearby AGN can allow detailed studies of the central accretion disks powering the AGN, allowing reconstruction of many disk properties like the radial profile. Next, we argue that intensity interferometers can spatially resolve the broad-line regions of AGN at cosmological distances, and thereby provide a geometric determination of the angular diameter distances to those AGN when combined with reverberation mapping. Since this measurement can be performed for AGN at distances of hundreds of megaparsecs, this directly measures the Hubble expansion rate $H_0$, with a precision adequate to resolve the recent Hubble tension. Finally, we speculate on future applications that would be enabled by even larger intensity interferometer arrays.

  We analyse the radio-to-submillimetre spectral energy distribution (SED) for the central pseudobulge of NGC~1365 using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Very Large Array (VLA). This analysis shows that free-free emission dominates the continuum emission at 50--120~GHz and produces about 75 per cent of the 103~GHz continuum emission. However, the fraction of 103~GHz continuum emission originating from free-free emission varies significantly among different subregions in the pseudobulge, particularly for an outflow from the AGN on the eastern pseudobulge where the synchrotron emission produces half of the 103~GHz continuum emission. Free-free emission also dominates at 103~GHz within the central 400 pc diameter region, but this emission is associated with the AGN rather than star formation. The star formation rate (SFR) within the pseudobulge derived from the ALMA free-free emission is $8.9 \pm 1.1$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$. This is comparable to the SFR from the mid-infrared emission but higher than the SFR from the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ line emission, mainly because the pseudobulge is heavily dust obscured. The 1.5 GHz emission yields a comparable SFR for the pseudobulge but may have lower SFRs within subregions of the pseudobulge because of the diffusion outside of these regions of the electrons producing the synchrotron radiation. We propose that applying a correction factor of 75 per cent to the 80--110~GHz continuum emission could provide valuable estimates of the free-free emission without performing any SED decomposition, which could derive extinction-free SFRs within 20 per cent accuracy.
