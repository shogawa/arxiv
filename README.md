  We developed a Python package GEHONG to mock the three-dimensional spectral data cube under the observation of an ideal telescope for the Integral Field Spectrograph of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST-IFS). This package can generate one-dimensional spectra corresponding to local physical properties at specific positions according to a series of two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters of target sources. In this way, it can produce a spatially resolved spectral cube of the target source. Two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters, including surface brightness, stellar population, and line-of-sight velocity, can be modeled using the parametric model or based on real observational data and numerical simulation data. For the generation of one-dimensional spectra, we have considered four types of spectra, including the stellar continuum spectra, ionized gas emission lines, AGN spectra, and stellar spectra. That makes GEHONG able to mock various types of targets, including galaxies, AGNs, star clusters, and HII regions.

  Following the identification of the first confirmed individual neutrino source, Seyfert galaxies have emerged as the most prominent class of high-energy neutrino emitters. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation of the outflow--cloud interaction scenario for neutrino production in Seyfert nuclei. In this framework, fast AGN-driven winds collide with clumpy gas clouds in the nuclear region, forming bow shocks that efficiently accelerate cosmic-ray protons. The accelerated protons subsequently interact with cold protons from the outflows via inelastic proton--proton ($pp$) collisions, producing high-energy neutrinos, while the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process with disk photons may provide a subdominant contribution at the highest energies. Applying this model to five neutrino-associated Seyfert galaxies, we successfully reproduce the observed TeV neutrino fluxes without violating existing gamma-ray constraints. By integrating over the Seyfert population using X-ray luminosity functions, we further demonstrate that Seyfert galaxies can account for a substantial fraction of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background in the $10^4-10^5~{\rm GeV}$ energy range.

  Hyperluminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs; SFRs up to about 1000 Msun yr-1), though rare, provide key constraints on galaxy evolution. H-ATLAS J084933.4+021443, a z = 2.41 binary HyLIRG (galaxies W and T) with two additional luminous companions (C and M), offers an ideal laboratory for studying star formation during "cosmic noon". We use ALMA to obtain resolved imaging and kinematics of CO J:7-6, [C I] 2-1, H2O, and rest-frame 340-1160 GHz continuum emission in all four galaxies. Each system is spatially resolved within ~0.3 arcsec (2.5 kpc) apertures. Gas kinematics in W and T are rotation-dominated, with galaxy T showing emission extended along its kinematic minor axis due to lensing magnification. Spatially resolved SEDs indicate that W is well fitted by single-temperature greybody dust despite hosting a luminous AGN, while T requires an additional hot-dust component and extra millimetre emission. We confirm [C I] J:2-1 as a tracer of warm/dense molecular gas in these extreme systems, though its luminosity ratio with CO J:7-6 rises sub-linearly. We derive resolved (2.5 kpc-scale) Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) relations for W and T using both cold and warm/dense gas, finding depletion times of about 50-100 Myr (W) and about 100-500 Myr (T). Both galaxies follow a steep SK relation with power-law index n ~ 1.7, significantly above the n ~ 1 observed in normal star-forming galaxies.

  Radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) eject a huge amount of energy into the surrounding medium and are thought to potentially prevent gas cooling and maintain the quiescence of massive galaxies. The short-lived, sporadic, and anisotropic nature of radio activities, coupled with the detection of abundant cold gas around some massive quiescent galaxies, raise questions about the efficiency of radio feedback in massive galaxies. Here we present an innovative method rooted in artificial intelligence to separate galaxies in which radio feedback is effective (RFE), regardless of current radio emission, from those in which radio feedback is ineffective (RFI), according to their optical images. Galaxies categorized as RFE are all dynamically hot, whereas quiescent RFI (RFI-Q) galaxies usually have extended cold-disk components. At given stellar mass, dark matter halos hosting RFE galaxies are between four to ten times more massive than those of RFI-Q galaxies. We find, for the first time, that almost all RFE galaxies have scant cold gas, irrespective of AGN activity. In contrast, many RFI-Q galaxies are surrounded by substantial amounts of condensed atomic gas, indicating a different evolutionary path from RFE galaxies. Our finding provides direct and compelling evidence that a radio AGN has gone through about 300 on-off cycles and that radio feedback can prevent gas cooling over a timescale much longer than that of radio activity. Contrary to general belief, our analysis shows that only a small fraction of massive galaxies are influenced by strong radio AGNs, suggesting that current galaxy formation models need serious revision.

  In this manuscript, we recheck the spectroscopic properties of SDSS J134733.36+121724.27 (4C+12.50), confirming the presence of the double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$\AA\ doublet and a broad H$\alpha$. The former likely results from AGN-driven biconical outflows, while the absence of a broad H$\beta$ supports a classification of the source as a Type-1.9 AGN. We analyze its high-quality Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical spectrum after robustly subtracting host galaxy and AGN continuum contributions through a simple stellar population fitting method employing 39 templates and a power-law continuum. Each narrow line of the [O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$\AA\ doublet is better described by two Gaussian components (blue-shifted and red-shifted) than by a single Gaussian, as confirmed by the F-test. Broad components are included for both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, but only H$\alpha$ reveals a significant detection, further supported by a comparison between the SDSS spectrum and that previously reported. These results support that the object is highly consistent with a Type-1.9 AGN classification, and the double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}] profiles are most likely produced by AGN-driven biconical outflows rather than by a rotating narrow-line region or a dual AGN merger system. Additional observations are still needed to strengthen these conclusions.

  We present the results of the 2023 spectroscopic reverberation mapping (RM) campaign for active galactic nuclei (AGN) of NGC 5548, continuing our long-term monitoring program. Using the Lijiang 2.4-meter telescope, we obtained 74 spectra with a median cadence of 1.9 days. Through detailed spectral decomposition, we measured the light curves of the optical continuum at 5100~\AA\ and the broad He~{\sc ii}, He~{\sc i}, H$\gamma$, and H$\beta$ emission lines. The time lags of these lines relative to the continuum are measured as $1.3^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$, $2.3^{+1.5}_{-2.1}$, $10.0^{+2.0}_{-1.8}$, and $15.6^{+2.6}_{-2.9}$ days (rest-frame), respectively. Velocity-resolved lag profiles for H$\gamma$ and H$\beta$ were constructed. Combined with data from previous seasons (2015$-$2021), we find that the radial ionization stratification of the broad-line region (BLR) is stable; the average virial mass of the supermassive black hole in NGC~5548 is $(2.6\pm1.1)\times 10^{8}M_{\odot}$, consistent with the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation; the broad He~{\sc ii} line exhibits the largest responsivity, followed by broad He~{\sc i} (or H$\gamma$) and H$\beta$ lines; the BLR kinematics show significant temporal evolution, transitioning from virialized motions to signatures of inflow and outflow. Furthermore, an analysis of 35 years of historical data confirms a 3.5-year time lag between variations in the optical luminosity and the BLR radius, potentially implicating the role of radiation pressure or dynamical structure changes in the inner accretion disk. Long-term campaign demonstrates that the BLR in NGC 5548 is a robust yet dynamically evolving entity, providing crucial insights into AGN structure and accretion physics.

  In our previous work, we applied the ICCF-Cut method to the continuum reverberation mapping (CRM) of six active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on the published Swift data. Extending this work, we perform a systematic AGN CRM study utilizing the Swift archive. We enlarge our sample with eight additional AGNs at $z&lt;0.05$ with high-cadence ($&lt;3$ days) and multiband photometric observations. Time series analysis of these light curves shows two main results: (1) The interband lags are broadly consistent with $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$, while the average interband lags are larger than those predicted by the standard thin accretion disk model. (2) For most targets, there exists a $U$ band lag excess, which is probably due to the diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR). We employ the ICCF-Cut method to extract the possible diffuse continuum component from the $U$ band light curves and calculate the diffuse continuum lags ($\tau_{\rm cut}$), which are generally consistent with the lags ($\tau_{\rm jav}$) derived by the JAVELIN Photometric Reverberation Mapping Model. Further analysis with our sample indicates a positive correlation between the diffuse continuum region size and the BLR size ($R_{\rm DCR}-R_{\rm BLR}$ relation), as well as another correlation with the luminosity ($R_{\rm DCR}-L$ relation). These findings provide further evidence for a significant contribution of diffuse continuum emission from the BLR to the AGN continuum lags.

  Continuum reverberation mapping probes the size scale of the optical continuum-emitting region in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The source of this emission has long been thought to originate from the accretion disk, but recent studies suggest the broad line region (BLR) may significantly contribute to both the observed flux and continuum interband delays. We monitored 18 AGN over four years of observations to acquire high quality optical continuum light curves, measuring time lags between different photometric bands and determining continuum emission sizes for each AGN. We add this sample to existing lag measurements to test the correlation between continuum lags at $5100\r{A}$ ($\tau_{5100}$) and $5100\r{A}$ luminosity ($L_{5100}$). We observe that $\tau_{5100} \propto L_{5100}^{0.4}$, broadly consistent with the theoretical expectations of $\tau \propto L^{1/2}$ expected for continuum reverberation from either the accretion disk or the BLR.
