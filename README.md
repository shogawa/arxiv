  GW190521, the most massive binary black hole merger confidently detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, is the first gravitational-wave observation of an intermediate-mass black hole. The signal was followed approximately 34 days later by flare ZTF19abanrhr, detected in AGN J124942.3+344929 by the Zwicky Transient Facility at the 78\% spatial contour for GW190521s sky localization. Using the GWTC-2.1 data release, we find that the association between GW190521 and flare ZTF19abanrhr as its electromagnetic counterpart is preferred over a random coincidence of the two transients with a log Bayes factor of 8.6, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$ 5400 to 1 for equal prior odds and $\sim$ 400 to 1 assuming an astrophysical prior odds of 1/13. Given the association, the multi-messenger signal allows for an estimation of the Hubble constant, finding $H_0 = 102^{+27}_{-25}\mathrm{\ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}$ when solely analyzing GW190521 and $79.2^{+17.6}_{-9.6}\mathrm{\ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}$ assuming prior information from the binary neutron star merger GW170817, both consistent with the existing literature.

  The study of distant galaxy groups and clusters at the peak epoch of star formation is limited by the lack of a statistically and homogeneously selected and spectroscopically confirmed sample. Recent discoveries of concentrated starburst activities in cluster cores have opened a new window to hunt for these structures based on their integrated IR luminosities. Hereby we carry out the large NOEMA (NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array) program targeting a statistical sample of infrared-luminous sources associated with overdensities of massive galaxies at z&gt;2, the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). We present the first result from the ongoing NICE survey, a compact group at z=3.95 in the Lockman Hole field (LH-SBC3), confirmed via four massive (M_star&gt;10^10.5M_sun) galaxies detected in CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) lines. The four CO-detected members of LH-SBC3 are distributed over a 180 kpc physical scale, and the entire structure has an estimated halo mass of ~10^13Msun and total star formation rate (SFR) of ~4000Msun/yr. In addition, the most massive galaxy hosts a radio-loud AGN with L_1.4GHz, rest = 3.0*10^25W/Hz. The discovery of LH-SBC3 demonstrates the feasibility of our method to efficiently identify high-z compact groups or forming cluster cores. The existence of these starbursting cluster cores up to z~4 provides critical insights into the mass assembly history of the central massive galaxies in clusters.

  We use VLT-MUSE integral field unit data, to study the ionized gas physical properties and kinematics, as well as the stellar populations of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 232. The data cover a field of view of 60''x60'' at a spatial resolution of ~850 pc. The emission-line profiles have been fitted with two Gaussian components, one associated to the emission of the gas in the disc and the other due to a bi-conical outflow. The spectral synthesis reveals a predominant old stellar population with ages exceeding 2 Gyr, with the largest contributions seen at the nucleus and decreasing outwards. Meanwhile, the young and intermediate age stellar populations exhibit a positive gradient with increasing radius and a circum-nuclear star forming ring with radius of ~0.5 kpc traced by stars younger than 20 Myr, is observed. This, along with the fact that AGN and SF dominated regions present similar gaseous oxygen abundances, suggests a shared reservoir feeding both star formation and the AGN. We have estimated a maximum outflow rate in ionized gas of ~1.26 M_{sun}/yr observed at a distance of ~560 pc from the nucleus. The corresponding maximum kinetic power of the outflow is ~3.4x10^{41} erg/s. This released energy could be sufficient to suppress star formation within the ionization cone, as evidenced by the lower star formation rates observed in this region.

  The search for multi-messenger signals of binary black hole (BBH) mergers is crucial to understanding the merger process of BBH and the relative astrophysical environment. Considering BBH mergers occurring in the active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks, we focus on the accompanying high-energy neutrino production from the interaction between the jet launched by the post-merger remnant BH and disk materials. Particles can be accelerated by the shocks generated from the jet-disk interaction and subsequently interact with the disk gas and radiations to produce high-energy neutrinos through hadronic processes. We demonstrate that the identification of the high-energy neutrino signal from BBH merger in AGN disks is feasible. In addition, the joint BBH gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino detection rate is derived, which can be used to constrain the BBH merger rate and the accretion rate of the remnant BH based on the future associated detections of GWs and neutrinos.

  We present a broad analysis of X-ray polarimetric observational prospects for radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on the role of parsec-scale components. We provide a revision of self-consistent type-1 and type-2 generic AGN radiative transfer models that were obtained with a Monte Carlo code STOKES, evaluating the effects of absorption and scattering. Our model consists of a central disc-corona emission obtained with the KYNSTOKES code in the lamp-post geometry, an equatorial wedge-shaped dusty torus and two symmetric conical polar outflows. We argue that the information on the mutual orientation, shape, relative size and composition of such components, usually obtained from spectroscopy or polarimetry in other wavelengths, is essential for the X-ray polarization analysis of the obscured type-2 AGNs. We provide general detectability prospects for AGNs with 2-8 keV polarimeters on board of the currently flying IXPE satellite and the forthcoming eXTP mission. Finally, we assess the role of contemporary X-ray polarimetry in our understandings of the unified AGN model after the first year and a half of IXPE operation.

  We perform axisymmetric, two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to investigate accretion flows around spinning AGN. To mimic the space-time geometry of spinning black holes, we consider effective Kerr potential, and the mass of the black holes is $10^8 M_{\odot}$. We initialize the accretion disc with a magnetized torus by adopting the toroidal component of the magnetic vector potential. The initial magnetic field strength is set by using the plasma beta parameter ($\beta_0$). We observe self-consistent turbulence generated by magneto rotational instability (MRI) in the disc. The MRI turbulence transports angular momentum in the disc, resulting in an angular momentum distribution that approaches a Keplerian distribution. We investigate the effect of the magnetic field on the dynamics of the torus and associated mass outflow from the disc around a maximally spinning black hole $(a_k = 0.99)$. For the purpose of our analysis, we investigate the magnetic state of our simulation model. The model $\beta_0 = 10$ indicates the behaviour similar to the "magnetically arrested disk (MAD)'' state, and all the other low magnetic model remains in the SANE state. We observe that mass outflow rates are significantly enhanced with the increased magnetic field in the disc. We find a positive correlation between the magnetic field and mass outflow rates. We also investigate the effect of black hole spin on the magnetized torus evolution. However, we have not found any significant effect of black hole spin on mass outflows in our model. Finally, we discuss the possible astrophysical applications of our simulation results.
