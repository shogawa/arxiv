  Sub/millimeter galaxies are a key population for the study of galaxy evolution because the majority of star formation at high redshifts occurred in galaxies deeply embedded in dust. To search for this population, we have performed an extensive survey with ALMA, called the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). This survey covers 133 arcmin^2 area and securely detects 180 sources at z~0.5-6 with a flux limit of ~0.2 mJy at 1.2 mm (Fujimoto et al. 2023). Here we report the results of multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of the whole ALCS sample, utilizing the observed-frame UV to millimeter photometry. We find that the majority of the ALCS sources lie on the star-forming main sequence, with a smaller fraction showing intense starburst activities. The ALCS sample contains high infrared-excess sources IRX=log(Ldust/LUV)&gt;1), including two extremely dust-obscured galaxies (IRX&gt;5). We also confirm that the ALCS sample probes a broader range in lower dust mass than conventional SMG samples in the same redshift range. We identify six heavily obscured AGN candidates that are not detected in the archival Chandra data in addition to the three X-ray AGNs reported by Uematsu et al. (2023). The inferred AGN luminosity density shows a possible excess at z=2-3 compared with that determined from X-ray surveys below 10 keV.

  In this manuscript, clues are provided to support globally negative AGN feedback on star formation in the host galaxies of the local low-redshift SDSS Type-2 AGN, based on the different dependence of narrow H$\alpha$ line luminosity $L_{H\alpha}$ on optical continuum luminosity $\lambda L_{cont}$ between the starforming galaxies and the Type-2 AGN. Through the measured $L_{H\alpha}$ and $\lambda L_{cont}$ in SDSS starforming galaxies, there is a strong linear correlation between $\lambda L_{cont}$ and $L_{H\alpha}$, accepted as a standard correlation without effects of AGN activity. Meanwhile, considering apparent contributions of AGN activity to narrow H$\alpha$ line emissions in the Type-2 AGN, the correlation between $\lambda L_{cont}$ and $L_{H\alpha}$ in the SDSS Type-2 AGN leads to statistically lower $L_{H\alpha}$ in the Type-2 AGN than in the starforming galaxies, with significance level higher than 5$\sigma$, even after considering necessary effects (including effects of host galaxy properties), leading to accepted conclusion on the globally negative AGN feedback in the local Type-2 AGN. Meanwhile, properties of Dn(4000) and H$\delta_A$ can provide indirect clues to support the globally negative AGN feedback in the local Type-2 AGN, due to older stellar ages in the Type-2 AGN. Moreover, it is interesting to expect more than 50\% narrow H$\alpha$ emissions globally suppressed in the host galaxies of the Type-2 AGN relative to the starforming galaxies. The results not only support globally negative AGN feedback in the local Type-2 AGN, but also show further clues on the quantification of suppressions of star formation by the globally negative AGN feedback.

  We investigate the connection between the most luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN), galaxy pairs, and post-mergers in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We select galaxy pairs and post-mergers with a mass ratio between 1:10 $&lt; \mu &lt;$ 1:1 and a redshift between $0&lt;z&lt;1$. We compare the incidence of luminous AGN in pairs with matched non-pair controls, finding that AGN with luminosity $L_{\mathrm{bol}}&gt;10^{44}$ erg/s occur in $\sim $26\% of paired galaxies with a companion within 20 kpc, compared with $\sim $14\% in controls (a fractional excess of $\sim$2). The enhancement of AGN in galaxy pairs is luminosity dependent, with the highest excess (a factor of $\sim6\pm2$ at the closest separations) for AGN with $L_{\mathrm{bol}}&gt;10^{45}$ erg/s. Additionally, pairs exhibit a modest yet statistically significant excess of luminous AGN up to $\sim$150 kpc in separation. For pairs which merge between $0&lt;z&lt;1$, AGN fractions are elevated between 1.5 Gyr before and after coalescence, with the highest excess closest to coalescence. Our results indicate that pre-coalescence interactions drive excesses of luminous AGN, but that luminous AGN in galaxy pairs are not ubiquitous. Finally, we investigate what fraction of AGN can be associated with an interaction (either having a companion within 100 kpc or a merger within the last 500 Myr). For AGN with $L_{\mathrm{bol}}&gt;10^{45}$ erg/s, $\sim$55\% are interacting, compared with a 30\% interaction fraction in AGN with $10^{44}&lt;L_{\mathrm{bol}}&lt;10^{44.5}$ erg/s. Our results support a picture in which interactions play a dominant role in (but are not the sole cause of) triggering the most luminous AGN.

  Probing the molecular gas reservoirs of z&gt;~6 quasar (QSO) host galaxies is fundamental to understanding the coevolution of star formation and black hole growth in these extreme systems. Yet, there is still an inhomogeneous coverage of molecular gas tracers. To measure the average excitation and mass of the molecular gas reservoirs in the brightest z&gt;6.5 QSO hosts, we combined new observations of CO(2-1) emission with existing observations of CO(6-5), CO(7-6), [C I], [C II], and dust-continuum emission. We reduced and analysed the VLA observations of CO(2-1) in three z=6.5-6.9 QSO hosts--the highest redshift observations of CO(2-1) to date. By combining these with the nine z=5.7-6.4 QSO hosts for which CO(2-1) has already been observed, we studied the spread in molecular gas masses and CO excitation. Two of our three QSOs, were undetected in CO(2-1), implying more highly excited CO than in the z=6.4 QSO J1148+5251. We detected CO(2-1) at $5.1\sigma$ for our highest-redshift target, J2348-3054, yielding a molecular gas mass of $(1.2\pm0.2)\times 10^{10}\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. This molecular gas mass is equivalent to the lower limit on the dynamical mass measured from resolved [C II] observations, implying little mass in stars or neutral gas within the [C II]-emitting region. On average, these QSO hosts have far higher CO(6-5)-, CO(7-6)-, and [C II] vs CO(2-1) line ratios than local AGN hosts; with a mean CO(6-5)-to-CO(1-0) line luminosity ratio of $r_{6,1}=0.9\pm0.2$. Our new CO(2-1) observations show that even at 780 Myr after the Big Bang, QSO host galaxies can already have molecular gas masses of $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, consistent with a picture in which these z&gt;6 QSOs reside in massive starbursts that are coevolving with the supermassive black holes. Our results imply the presence of extremely dense and warm molecular gas reservoirs illuminated by strong interstellar radiation fields.

  We present the result of a spectroscopic campaign targeting Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) candidates selected using a novel unsupervised machine-learning (ML) algorithm trained on optical and mid-infrared (mid-IR) photometry. AGN candidates are chosen without incorporating prior AGN selection criteria and are fainter, redder, and more numerous, $\sim$340 AGN deg$^{-2}$, than comparable photometric and spectroscopic samples. In this work we obtain 178 rest-optical spectra from two candidate ML-identified AGN classes with the Hectospec spectrograph on the MMT Observatory. We find that our first ML-identified group, is dominated by Type I AGNs (85%) with a $&lt;3$% contamination rate from non-AGNs. Our second ML-identified group is comprised mostly of Type II AGNs (65%) with a moderate contamination rate of 15% primarily from star-forming galaxies. Our spectroscopic analyses suggest that the classes recover more obscured AGNs, confirming that ML techniques are effective at recovering large populations of AGNs at high levels of extinction. We demonstrate the efficacy of pairing existing WISE data with large-area and deep optical/near-infrared photometric surveys to select large populations of AGNs and recover obscured SMBH growth. This approach is well suited to upcoming photometric surveys, such as Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.
