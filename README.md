  In this work, we analysed new LOw Frequency ARray observations of the mini halo in the cluster RBS797, together with archival Very Large Array observations and the recent Chandra results. This cluster is known to host a powerful active galactic nucleus (AGN) at its centre, with two pairs of jets propagating in orthogonal directions. Recent X-ray observations have detected three pairs of shock fronts, connected with the activity of the central AGN. Our aim is to investigate the connection between the mini halo emission and the activity of the central source. We find that the diffuse radio emission is elongated in different directions at 144 MHz (east-west) with respect to 1.4 GHz (north-south), tracing the orientation of the two pairs of jets. The mini halo emission is characterised by an average spectral index $\alpha=-1.02\pm 0.05$. The spectral index profile of the mini halo shows a gradual flattening from the centre to the periphery. Such a trend is unique among the mini halos studied to date, and resembles the spectral index trend typical of particles re-accelerated by shocks. However, the estimated contribution to the radio brightness profile coming from shock re-acceleration is found to be insufficient to account for the radial brightness profile of the mini halo. We propose three scenarios that could explain the observed trend: (i) the AGN-driven shocks are propagating onto an already existing mini halo, re-energising the electrons. We estimate that the polarisation induced by the shocks could be detected at 6 GHz and above; (ii) we could be witnessing turbulent re-acceleration in a high magnetic field cluster; and (iii) the mini halo could have a hadronic origin, in which the particles are injected by Future observations in polarisation would be fundamental to understand the role of shocks and the magnetic field.

  We present spatially resolved gas kinematics, ionization, and energetics of 11 type 1 and 5 type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong ionized gas outflows at z $&lt;0.3$ using Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph Integral Field Unit (GMOS-IFU) data. We find a strongly blueshifted region in [OIII] velocity maps, representing an approaching cone in biconical outflows, and blueshifted and redshifted regions in H$\alpha$ velocity maps, which show gravitationally rotating kinematics. AGN photoionization is dominant in the central region of most targets, and some of them also show ring-like structures of LINER or composite that surround the AGN-dominated center. Following our previous studies, we kinematically determine outflow sizes by the ratio between [OIII] and stellar velocity dispersion. Outflow sizes of type 1 AGNs follow the same kinematic outflow size-[OIII] luminosity relation obtained from the type 2 IFU sample in Kang &amp; Woo and Luo (updated slope $0.29\pm0.04$), while they are limited to the central kpc scales, indicating the lack of global impact of outflows on the interstellar medium. Small mass outflow rates and large star formation rates of the combined sample support that there is no evidence of rapid star formation quenching by outflows, which is consistent with the delayed AGN feedback.
