  We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three candidate active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in low-mass galaxies in the Bo\"otes field with the aim of improving constraints on the occupation fraction of low-mass black holes (BHs). Galaxies with low stellar masses ($M_{\star} &lt; 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$) are particularly interesting hosts for AGNs as they may contain BHs that have not grown significantly since the epoch of their formation in the early Universe. Using archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we find three X-ray luminous low-mass galaxies and assess whether they host AGNs. We find one of these sources to be variable in the X-ray and compute its X-ray light curve and spectrum. We compute the X-ray, mid-infrared, and [O III] luminosities and compare them to established AGN luminosity relationships in the literature. We then fit various star-forming, dust emission, and AGN templates to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The star formation rates estimated from the SED fits are unable to explain the observed X-ray luminosities of the candidates, providing more support for the presence of AGNs. By analysing the deviation from linear relationships between X-ray and mid-infrared luminosities, we find these systems to be obscured (with $\log N_{\rm H}[{\rm {cm^{-2}}}] \sim 22.7, &gt; 25.0$, and $24.4$, respectively). We employ the scaling relationship between BH mass and stellar velocity dispersion to estimate the BH masses as $\sim 10^5 - 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and accreting at Eddington ratios $10^{-2} &lt; \lambda_{\rm Edd} &lt;10^{-1}$.

  Different studies have suggested the emergence of the so-called golden mass, corresponding to a virial mass of $\sim 10^{12} \, M_{\rm \odot}$ and a stellar mass of $\sim 5 \times 10^{10} \, M_{\rm \odot}$. This mass scale marks a maximum in star formation efficiency, where galaxies are minimally affected by processes like SN and AGN feedback. We use \textsc{camels} cosmological simulations, based on the IllustrisTNG subgrid, to study the origin of this mass scale and whether it persists when varying feedback from SN and AGN. We focus on the correlation between the total-to-stellar mass within the half-mass radius and stellar mass, which follows an inverted bell-shaped trend, with a minimum at the golden mass. SN feedback processes impact the emergence of the golden mass, which shifts to lower mass for high values of wind velocity and energy. We find that most AGN feedback parameters influence the emergence of the golden mass, altering the correlation slope at high mass: the black hole radiative efficiency is the most impactful, followed by the black hole feedback factor and quasar threshold. ETGs preserve the inverted bell-shaped trend, while LTGs have monotonically decreasing DM fractions with mass, with mild indication of an inversion only at low redshift, confirming results from observations. When connecting with global quantities, we see that star formation efficiency show a bell-shaped trend peaking at the golden mass, with behaviours that mirror the central quantities. In ETGs a peak at lower mass is seen, while LTGs mirror the behaviour in the central quantity, with mild indication of a maximum in the stellar fraction only at low redshift. Overall, we find that the emergence of the golden mass is driven by the SN- and AGN-feedback and appears earlier in cosmic time for stronger-feedback simulations, which faster quench star formation in the most massive galaxies.

  We present an analysis of millimeter CO observations to search and quantify signatures of molecular gas outflows. We exploit the large sample of $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.6$ galaxies observed as part of the PHIBSS1/2 surveys with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer, focusing on the 154 typical massive star-forming galaxies with CO detections (mainly CO(3-2), but including also CO(2-1) and CO(6-5)) at signal-to-noise (SNR) &gt; 1.5 and available properties (stellar mass, star formation rate, size) from ancillary data. None of the individual spectra exhibit a compelling signature of CO outflow emission even at high SNR &gt; 7. To search for fainter outflow signatures, we carry out an analysis of stacked spectra, including the full sample, as well as subsets, split in terms of stellar mass, redshift, inclination, offset in star formation rate (SFR) from the main sequence, and AGN activity. None of the physically motivated subsamples show any outflow signature. We report a tentative detection in a subset statistically designed to maximize outflow signatures. We derive upper limits on molecular gas outflow rate and mass loading factors $\eta$ based on our results and find $\eta \leq$ 2.2-35.4, depending on the subsample. Much deeper CO data and observations of alternative tracers are needed to decisively constrain the importance of cold molecular gas component of outflows relative to other gas phases.

  In the last decade of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) monitoring programs, the Mets\"ahovi Radio Observatory detected multiple times seven powerful flaring narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies at 37 GHz. Several hypotheses have been proposed, but the understanding of this unique phenomenon is still far. To look at the case from a different point of view, we performed an emission line analysis of the optical spectra, with the aim of identifying similarities among the sources, that can be in turn possibly tied with the radio behavior. Our data were obtained with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. The results we obtained show that six out of seven sources have typical properties for the NLS1 class, and one of them is an intermediate Seyfert galaxy. We found on average black hole masses above the median value for the class (&gt; 10$^7$ M$_\odot$), and a strong Fe II emission, which could be a proxy for an intense ongoing accretion activity. Although interesting, the characteristics we found are not unusual for these kind of AGN: the optical spectra of our sources do not related with their unique radio properties. Therefore, further multi-wavelength studies will be necessary to narrow the field of hypotheses for this peculiar phenomenon.

  We present initial results from extremely well-resolved 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of idealized galaxy clusters, conducted using the AthenaPK code on the Frontier exascale supercomputer. These simulations explore the self-regulation of galaxy groups and cool-core clusters by cold gas-triggered active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback incorporating magnetized kinetic jets. Our simulation campaign includes simulations of galaxy groups and clusters with a range of masses and intragroup and intracluster medium properties. In this paper we present results that focus on a Perseus-like cluster. We find that the simulated clusters are self-regulating, with the cluster cores staying at a roughly constant thermodynamic state and AGN jet power staying at physically reasonable values ($\simeq 10^{44}-10^{45}$~erg/s) for billions of years without a discernible duty cycle. These simulations also produce significant amounts of cold gas, with calculations having strong magnetic fields generally both promoting cold gas formation and allowing cold gas out to much larger clustercentric radii ($\simeq 100$~kpc) than simulations with weak or no fields ($\simeq 10$~kpc), and also having more filamentary cold gas morphology. We find that AGN feedback significantly increases the strength of magnetic fields at the center of the cluster. We also find that the magnetized turbulence generated by the AGN results in turbulence where the velocity power spectra are tied to AGN activity whereas the magnetic energy spectra are much less impacted after reaching a stationary state.

  Low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can provide important constraints on the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a central challenge in modern cosmology. To date only small samples of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $M_{BH}&lt;10^5M_{\odot}$) and 'lesser' supermassive black holes (LSMBHs, $M_{BH}&lt;10^6M_{\odot}$) have been identified. Our present study of NGC 3259 at D=27 Mpc with the Binospec integral field unit spectrograph complemented with Keck Echelle Spectrograph and Imager observations demonstrates the need for and the power of the spectroscopic follow-up. NGC 3259 hosts a black hole with a mass of $M_{BH}=(1.7-4.1)\times10^5M_{\odot}$, inferred from multi-epoch spectroscopic data, that accretes at 1% of the Eddington limit as suggested by the analysis of archival XMM-Newton observations. It is the second nearest low-mass AGN after the archetypal galaxy NGC 4395. The spectroscopic data reveals a variable broad $H\alpha$ profile that is likely the result of asymmetrically distributed broad-line region (BLR) clouds or BLR outflow events. X-ray observations and the absence of an optical power-law continuum suggest partial obscuration of the accretion disk and hot corona by a dust torus. We estimate that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey could only detect similar objects to D=35 Mpc. A detailed photometric analysis of NGC 3259 using HST images provides a central spheroid stellar mass estimate 25 times lower than expected from the $M_{BH}-M^*_{sph}$ relation, making this galaxy a strong outlier. This discrepancy suggests divergent growth pathways for the central black hole and spheroid, potentially influenced by the presence of a bar in the galaxy. Finally, we demonstrate that the DESI and 4MOST surveys will detect low-accretion rate IMBHs and LSMBHs and the sensitivity of future X-ray instruments (such as AXIS and Athena) will secure their classification.

  The relationship between an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and its host galaxy is still far from being understood. Properties of the host galaxies of Seyfert nuclei, such as luminosity concentration, morphological type, metallicity, and age of the stellar population are expected to be related with nuclear activity -- either at the epoch of galaxy formation or in the present days via feeding of the central black-hole. In this paper we investigate whether stellar ages and metallicities are linked to the activity within the nucleus in a sample of AGN of various types. Our sample includes seven AGN, from Seyfert 1 to LINERs, observed with VLT/ISAAC and VLT/SINFONI. Based on an inverse method using a stellar library, we analyse H band infrared spectra, in a wavelength region devoid of emission lines, at a spectral resolution of about 3000, in the central few 100 pc. HST images are used to visualise the regions defined in each galaxy. For each galaxy, we give the results of the spectral synthesis, in particular the percentages of the stellar, power law and blackbody continua, and the percentages of various stellar types that account for the stellar lines. Out of the seven galaxies, three show strong and recent star formation in the inner 100 pc, while no star formation is detected in the three genuine Seyfert 2 galaxies. Beyond a radius of 100 pc, all show more or less recent star formation. Moreover we can conclude that the star formation history of the inner nucleus is highly heterogeneous.
