  We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging of the nearby Seyfert 1.9 galaxy NGC 4258, which hosts strong star formation regions as well as an anomalous jet-like radio structure that extends through a significant portion of its disk. This galaxy provides a unique environment to study Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-driven shocks and their impact on the interstellar medium (ISM) as its proximity allows for narrow-band observations of various near-infrared tracers sensitive to multiple levels of shock and radiative excitation: [Fe II] (1.64 $\mu$m), Pa$\alpha$ (1.87 $\mu$m), H$_2$ (2.21 $\mu$m), 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, Br$\alpha$ (4.05 $\mu$m), and Pf$\beta$ (4.66 $\mu$m), allowing us to trace shocks with parsec-scale resolution. Comparing these near-infrared observations with available ultraviolet, optical, radio, and X-ray imaging, we find that shocks present in the brightest regions of the anomalous radio structure are likely of low-velocity (50-100 km s$^{-1}$), suggesting that these features originate from AGN-driven winds that interact with the host medium and mechanically impart energy into the disk. Further, while co-spatial [Fe II] and H$_2$ emission indicate multi-phase shocks, PAH emission is relatively weaker or absent in the most shock-excited regions, consistent with the destruction of small dust grains. Finally, we propose that surveys identifying enhanced [Fe II] in AGN host galaxies may systematically reveal a key population where AGN feedback is significantly coupled with the surrounding ISM and actively shaping galaxy evolution.

  The Faint Object Camera (FOC) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) acquired high-resolution, spatially resolved polarimetric images of nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in the near ultraviolet (near-UV) band. Among the 25 individual targets in the polarized archives, 8 had no published analysis until the beginning of this series of papers. We tackle the last 5 targets in the following. In this paper, we finalize the publication of near-UV imaging polarimetry of AGNs in the HST/FOC archives. We render available spatially resolved polarization maps of the [OIII] emission lines for Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, as well as near-UV continuum polarization maps for Mrk 3, NGC 3862, Cygnus A and 3C 109. We make use of the generalized reduction pipeline presented in the first paper in this series to homogeneously analyze the five remaining polarized observations of AGNs in the FOC archives. In Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, we find a polarization pattern in the narrow-line regions consistent with scattering from an obscured nucleus. For NGC 3862, we confirm marginal UV polarization parallel with the inner radio jet, related to synchrotron emission. In Cygnus A, we report spatially resolved centro-symmetric polarization patterns in both opposite outflows, highlighting the scattering origin of the polarized light. Finally, 3C 109 shows high nuclear polarization, consistent with AGN-dominated emission and parallel with the radio axis, but in tension with polarization arising from dichroic absorption invoked by previous authors. The imaging polarimetry obtained for the narrow-line region and the extended scattering medium surrounding the obscured AGNs is aligned with the predictions of the unified AGN model and demonstrates the power of spatially-resolved polarimetric observation to decipher the complex morphologies at work in AGNs.

  Multi-messenger astronomy offers a powerful approach to studying high-energy radiative processes in astrophysical sources. A notable example was seen in 2017, when the IceCube Neutrino Observatory detected a high-energy neutrino event that was found to coincide with a gamma-ray flare from a blazar. Since then, numerous multi-messenger studies combining neutrino and photon data have been conducted, yet the origin of neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN) remains uncertain. In this work, we present the results of an X-ray observing program targeting two AGNs, NGC 1068 and PKS 1502+106. The multi-wavelength dataset includes new observations from NICER and NuSTAR from the observing proposal along with gamma-ray data collected using Fermi-LAT, and one archival observation from Chandra. Additionally, we derive the neutrino fluxes for both AGNs using ten years of IceCube data and neutrino spectra predicted by theoretical models. These results demonstrate the value of combining multi-messenger data in building and constraining theoretical models. They also highlight the importance of testing model predictions against observational data to refine measurements of both the neutrino flux and spectral shape.

  Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope with both far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) gratings, we measure the ionizing spectra of two bright, intermediate-redshift quasars in their rest-frame extreme ultraviolet (EUV). The availability of both NUV and FUV spectra allows us to define the quasar continuum and correct for strong Lyman-limit systems (LLS) that fall in the gap between the FUV and optical. Each AGN has a prominent LLS, but the flux recovery shortward of their Lyman edges allows us to fit and restore the true AGN continuum. In the EUV (450-912 A) these AGN have flux distributions, $F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha_{\nu}}$, with spectral indices $\alpha_{\nu} = 1.11\pm0.22$ (SBS 1010+535, $z_{\rm AGN} = 1.5086$) and $\alpha_{\nu} = 0.98\pm0.22$ (HS 0747+4259, $z_{\rm AGN} = 1.9006$), both considerably harder than the mean index, $\alpha_{\nu} = 1.41\pm0.15$, in a COS composite spectrum of 159 UV-bright AGN. These two AGN are outliers in the index distribution, perhaps resulting from their extremely high UV luminosity ($10^{48}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}$), estimated black-hole masses (0.5-1)$\times10^{10} M_{\odot}$, and effects on the inner accretion disk and Comptonized winds.
