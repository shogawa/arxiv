  Various galaxy merger detection methods have been applied to diverse datasets. However, it is difficult to understand how they compare. We aim to benchmark the relative performance of machine learning (ML) merger detection methods. We explore six leading ML methods using three main datasets. The first one (the training data) consists of mock observations from the IllustrisTNG simulations and allows us to quantify the performance metrics of the detection methods. The second one consists of mock observations from the Horizon-AGN simulations, introduced to evaluate the performance of classifiers trained on different, but comparable data. The third one consists of real observations from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey. For the binary classification task (mergers vs. non-mergers), all methods perform reasonably well in the domain of the training data. At $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3$, precision and recall range between $\sim$70\% and 80\%, both of which decrease with increasing $z$ as expected (by $\sim$5\% for precision and $\sim$10\% for recall at $0.76&lt;z&lt;1.0$). When transferred to a different domain, the precision of all classifiers is only slightly reduced, but the recall is significantly worse (by $\sim$20-40\% depending on the method). Zoobot offers the best overall performance in terms of precision and F1 score. When applied to real HSC observations, all methods agree well with visual labels of clear mergers but can differ by more than an order of magnitude in predicting the overall fraction of major mergers. For the multi-class classification task to distinguish pre-, post- and non-mergers, none of the methods offer a good performance, which could be partly due to limitations in resolution and depth of the data. With the advent of better quality data (e.g. JWST and Euclid), it is important to improve our ability to detect mergers and distinguish between merger stages.

  In this work we study the co-evolution of central black holes (BHs) and host galaxies by utilizing an advanced iteration of the DELPHI semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution. Based on dark matter halo merger trees spanning the redshift range from $z=20$ to $z=4$, it now incorporates essential components such as gas heating and cooling, cold and hot BH accretion, jet and radiative AGN feedback. We show how different BH growth models impact quasar and galaxy observables at $z \geq 5$, providing predictions that will help discriminate between super-Eddington and Eddington-limited accretion models: despite being both consistent with observed properties of SMBHs and their host galaxies at $z \sim 5-7$, they become very clearly distinguishable at higher redshift and in the intermediate mass regime. We find that the super-Eddington model, unlike the Eddington-limited scenario, predicts a gap in the BH mass function corresponding to the intermediate-mass range $10^4 \mathrm{M_\odot} &lt; M_\mathrm{bh} &lt; 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$. Additionally, it predicts black holes up to two orders of magnitude more massive for the same stellar mass at $z=9$. The resulting velocity dispersion - BH mass relation at $z \geq 5$ is consistent with local measurements, suggesting that its slope and normalisation are independent of redshift. Depending on the Eddington ratio, we also model the emergence of AGN jets, predicting their duty cycle across as a function of BH mass and their potential impact on the observed number density distribution of high-redshift AGN in the hard X-ray band.

  We use near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy covering simultaneously the $zJHK$ bands to look for outflowing gas from the nuclear environment of 1H0707-495 taking advantage that this region is dominated by low-ionization broad line region (BLR) lines, most of them isolated. We detect broad components in HI, FeII and OI, at rest to the systemic velocity, displaying full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of ~500 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with its classification as a narrow-line Seyfert~1 AGN. Moreover, most lines display a conspicuous blue-asymmetric profile, modeled using a blueshifted component, whose velocity shift reaches up to ~826 km s$^{-1}$. This last feature can be interpreted in terms of outflowing gas already observed in X-ray and UV lines in 1H0707-495 but not detected before in the low-ionization lines. We discuss the relevance of our findings within the framework of the wind scenario already proposed for this source and suggest that the wind extends well into the narrow line region due to the observation of a blueshifted component in the forbidden line of [SIII] $\lambda$9531.

  While supermassive black holes (BHs) are widely observed in the nearby and distant universe, their origin remains debated with two viable formation scenarios with light and heavy seeds. In the light seeding model, the first BHs form from the collapse of massive stars with masses of $10-100 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$, while the heavy seeding model posits the formation of $10^{4-5} \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ seeds from direct collapse. The detection of BHs at redshifts $z\gtrsim10$, edging closer to their formation epoch, provides critical observational discrimination between these scenarios. Here, we focus on the JWST-detected galaxy, GHZ 9, at $z\approx10$ that is lensed by the foreground cluster, Abell 2744. Based on 2.1 Ms deep Chandra observations, we detect a candidate X-ray AGN, which is spatially coincident with the high-redshift galaxy, GHZ 9. The BH candidate is inferred to have a bolometric luminosity of $(1.0^{+0.5}_{-0.4})\times10^{46} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}$, which corresponds to a BH mass of $(8.0^{+3.7}_{-3.2})\times10^7 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ assuming Eddington-limited accretion. This extreme mass at such an early cosmic epoch suggests the heavy seed origin for this BH candidate. Based on the Chandra and JWST discoveries of extremely high-redshift quasars, we have constructed the first simple AGN luminosity function extending to $z\approx10$. Comparison of this luminosity function with theoretical models indicates an over-abundant $z\approx10$ BH population, consistent with a higher-than-expected seed formation efficiency.
