High-energy multimessenger background analyses over the past decade have provided evidence for a population of hidden neutrino sources that are opaque to GeV-TeV gamma rays, a picture bolstered by recent observations of the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. The coronal regions in the hearts of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been proposed as the most promising sites for such hidden nonthermal particle production, and NGC 1068 is expected to be the most neutrino-active galaxy for IceCube. We demonstrate that the latest all-sky neutrino spectrum, exhibiting a spectral bend around 3-30 TeV, is consistent with predictions of the magnetically powered corona scenario, and the models for the all-sky neutrino flux can simultaneously explain the multimessenger data from NGC 1068 within observational and modeling uncertainties. We further show, in a largely model-independent way, that the contribution from NGC 1068-like sources does not overshoot the observed medium-energy neutrino flux. Finally, we highlight the key role of the Eddington ratio, which can drive substantial variations in the predicted neutrino fluxes of nearby AGNs, and we encourage systematic multimessenger searches for the neutrino-brightest AGNs.

Galaxy major mergers are a potential mechanism for triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, but their role remains debated, particularly beyond the local Universe. We aim to shed light on the merger-AGN connection at $z=0.5$-$2$, exploiting the multi-wavelength datasets and {\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations in the COSMOS field. We construct a stellar mass-limited sample and identify AGN via mid-infrared (MIR) colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We train convolutional neural networks to identify mergers with mock JWST observations. We create non-AGN and non-merger control samples matching the redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation rate distributions of the AGN and mergers. We find AGN to be moderately more frequent in mergers than in non-mergers, with excess ratios ranging from $\sim2.5$ (X-ray AGN) to $\sim1.3$ (MIR) and $\sim 1.1$-1.2 (SED AGN). Similarly, AGN galaxies show a higher merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) than non-AGN controls. We then study $f_{merg}$ as a function of relative and absolute AGN power, utilising the AGN fraction ($f_{AGN}$) and accretion disc luminosity (L$_{disc}$) parameters. We uncover a $f_{merg}$-$f_{AGN}$ relation with two regimes: $f_{merg}$ stays roughly flat for less-dominant AGN ($f_{AGN}&lt;0.8$) but increases at $f_{AGN}&gt;0.8$ for the MIR and X-ray AGN, and more gently for SED AGN, where mergers appear to be the main triggering mechanism. Additionally, $f_{merg}$ increases monotonically as a function of L$_{disc}$, for all AGN types, reaching $f_{merg}&gt;50\%$ for the most luminous AGN (L$_{disc} \gtrsim 10^{46}\,{erg\,s^{-1}}$). Overall, our results suggest that major mergers can trigger AGN out to the cosmic noon at $z\sim2$. Furthermore, the role of major mergers shows a clear dependence on AGN luminosity and remains the principal mechanism for fuelling the most powerful AGN.

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are characterized by strong temporal flux density variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, offering insights into the complex physical processes governing accretion and plasma outflows. To systematically investigate AGNs flux density variability in radio bands, a long-term program was initiated in late 2016: quasi-Simultaneous Multiwavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope (SMMAN). This work presents the first data release of the SMMAN program, spanning over eight years from 2016 to 2024 with observations at 4.8 and 23.6 GHz. The SMMAN sample includes 131 northern ($δ&gt;\sim0^{\circ}$) sources selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope third source catalog. The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $γ$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $γ$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values. The SMMAN dataset, incorporated with other historical and ongoing monitoring programs, will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of spectral energy distributions, search for quasi-periodic oscillations, and analyze supermassive black hole binary systems.

Bulges and disks are major structural components that define galaxy morphology. The mass ratios of bulges and disks increase statistically with the galaxy mass, with the high-mass end occupied by elliptical galaxies. Although previous theoretical studies have succeeded in reproducing this morphological sequence, it is not yet fully understood why and how this morphological sequence emerged. Galaxy mergers accompanying dark matter halo mergers have been proposed as the major route for bulge formation. On the other hand, it is observationally known that the mass fraction of galaxies (stars plus cold gas) in dark matter halos attains the peak value at $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12} {\rm M}_\odot$ throughout the cosmic time. Using a simple galaxy evolution model including mergers, we show that this feature is the fundamental cause of the morphological sequence. Halos hosting massive galaxies, which stay more massive than this peak mass for long periods during their growth, merge mostly with satellite halos having larger galaxy mass fractions than themselves. Such mergers increase the bulge mass fraction efficiently. In contrast, host halos of low-mass galaxies evolve under unfavorable condition for bulge growth because they stay below the peak mass and merge with satellite halos with smaller galaxy mass fractions. Previous studies suggest that the peak in galaxy mass fraction is created by feedback processes from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and young massive stars including supernovae (SN), which are considered to suppress star formation in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively. This study thus points to a close relationship between the galaxy morphology and feedback processes which have hitherto been considered unrelated and suggests the importance of further investigation into their causal relationship.

Previous studies based on the latest realisation of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3) have suggested a correlation between astrometric properties (such as the radio-optical offset) and redshift for active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We extend these investigations by using a large, all-sky sample of approximately 22,000 compact radio sources from the Radio Fundamental catalogue (RFC) to examine this relationship in a systematic and statistically robust manner. We compiled redshifts for about 10,000 RFC sources over the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 5 by combining data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17/19 with additional datasets from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. Cross-matching with Gaia Data Release 3 yielded a clean sample of 4,068 RFC objects with reliable spectroscopic redshifts and classifications (galaxies and quasi-stellar objects; QSOs). We analysed the redshift dependence of their radio astrometric properties from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and their optical astrometric properties from Gaia. We find that the VLBI astrometric properties show no significant dependence on redshift within the achieved level of precision. In contrast, several optical astrometric quantities exhibit clear redshift-dependent behaviour. The median absolute radio-optical offsets decrease markedly over 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.5, where galaxies dominate the sample, decline more gradually over 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3, and exhibit a mild increase at z &gt; 1.3, where QSOs dominate. Similar behaviour is observed for several Gaia astrometric quantities, including astrometric uncertainties, proper motions, and G magnitudes. These behaviours can be largely explained by the dependence of Gaia astrometric performance on G magnitude and by the evolution of the G magnitude with redshift.

We present a comprehensive study of host galaxies of radio sources within the 1.35$R_{200}$ of the Coma cluster by combining deep 144MHz observations from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) with optical spectroscopy and photometry from DESI and SDSS. We identify 79 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members with reliable radio emission and classify them into compact, extended, and tailed subsamples according to their radio morphologies. By combining their radio and optical properties, we find compact radio sources are predominantly associated with massive, quiescent galaxies driven by AGN activity, while tailed sources are largely hosted by star-forming galaxies, tracing ongoing ram pressure stripping (RPS). Using phase-space analysis and a projected infall time proxy ($d_R$), we find that extended sources are preferentially located in the cluster outskirts ($d_R &gt; 1$), while tailed sources are concentrated in the intermediate infall region ($0.4 &lt; d_R &lt; 1.0$), highlighting the influence of the dense intracluster medium.

We present a detailed study of near-infrared (2-4$\rm μ$m) JWST/NIRSpec spectra of 48 high-redshift ($z=2.53^{+1.32}_{-0.70}$) galaxies detected with ALMA at $&gt;3σ$. From a multi-wavelength SED analysis we establish the sample has a a median stellar mass of $\rm\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot)=10.8\pm0.1$ and dust mass of $\rm\log_{10}(M_{\rm d}/M_\odot)=8.7\pm0.1$, covering a broad range of far-infrared luminosity $\rm (\log_{10}(L_{FIR}/L_\odot)=10.9-12.7)$. The majority of sources show no signs of AGN activity, with 40% having either X-ray counterparts $(\rm L_{Xc}&gt;10^{42}erg/s)$, elevated optical line ratios, or broad (FWHM&gt;800 km/s) H$α$ profiles, although we note this is a lower limit due to the stochastic placement of NIRSpec slits. We establish the sample has a median gas-phase metallicity of $12+\log({\rm O/H})=8.71\pm0.02$, as derived from the [NII]/H$α$ ratio, with the most FIR-luminous galaxies ($\rm\log_{10}(L_{\rm FIR}/L_\odot)&gt;12$) falling $0.15\pm0.03$dex above the fundamental metallicity relation. From the [SII] emission-line doublet ratio, we measure a median electron density of $\log_{10}(n_{\rm e}/{\rm cm}^{-3})=2.53\pm0.07$ consistent with less-massive, star-forming, galaxies at the same epoch. For nine galaxies with [OII] and H$β$ detections (median $\rm\log_{10}(L_{\rm FIR}/L_\odot)=11.81\pm0.15$), we derive a median observed (dust-uncorrected) ionisation parameter of $\rm\log_{10}(U)=-2.84\pm0.06$. Our results indicate that luminous far-infrared galaxies are massive, chemically evolved systems that appear to deviate from the standard dust and metal production equilibrium observed in less obscured galaxies. This study demonstrates the synergy of JWST and ALMA in unveiling the nature of DSFGs, and highlights the need for a NIRSpec survey of uniformly selected, massive, dust-obscured, galaxies to fully characterise their interstellar medium.
