  The torus in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a complex dynamical structure of gas and dust. It is thought to be composed of an equatorial dusty disk and a polar dusty wind launched by radiation pressure. However, this picture is based on studies of moderately accreting AGN. Models suggest that the disk/wind structure will change with specific accretion rate. Here we examine the wind launching region in two high accretion rate objects, I Zw 1 (super-Eddington) and H0557-385 (high-Eddington), using high spatial resolution interferometric observations in the $K$-band from VLTI/GRAVITY and $LM$-bands VLTI/MATISSE. We recover wavelength-dependent sizes of the dust emission using a Gaussian and power law fit to the visibilities. Both objects are partially resolved and have radial sizes in the $KLM$-bands between 0.3 - 1.5 mas, with no signs of elongation. Combining our measurements with VLTI/MIDI $N$-band data gives a full multi-wavelength picture of the dust structure. We find that in H0557-385, the dust sizes between $3.5-8\:\mu\mathrm{m}$ are independent of the wavelength, roughly constant at $3-10$ sublimation radii. We argue that this indicates a direct view of the wind launching region and, together with an absence of polar elongation, this implies that any wind would be launched in a preferentially equatorial direction or blown out by strong radiation pressure. The size-wavelength relation for both objects shows a preferentially disky equatorial dust distribution. We conclude that there is strong evidence that the Eddington ratio shapes the inner dust structure, most notably the wind-launching region and wind direction.

  The physical origin of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability remains unclear. Here we propose that the magnetic reconnection driven by the migration of satellite black holes (sBHs) in the AGN disc can be a new plausible mechanism for AGN short-term variability. During the sBH migration, the co-moving plasmas surrounding the sBH could influence the large-scale magnetic field of the AGN disk and trigger the magnetic reconnections to contribute to AGN UV/optical variability. Meanwhile, the plasma, which is accelerated by the magnetic reconnection, will successfully escape from the disc at Alfven velocity and cause a secondary magnetic reconnection in the corona. For a $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}~{M_\mathrm{\odot}}$ sBH (including its binding gas) in the inner regions of the disc surrounding a supermassive black hole with $\sim 10^{7}~{M_\mathrm{\odot}}$, the reconnection process occurred in the space out of the disc can produce X-ray emission, which can last $\sim 10^4-10^6~\rm s$ with the luminosity $\sim 10^{39}- 10^{43}~\rm{erg ~s^{-1}}$.

  Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) characterized by moderate luminosities, weak X-ray emissions, and faint high-ionization lines, challenging conventional models of black hole growth and AGN activity. In this study, we propose that these sources are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate the critical roles of photon scattering, reflections, and shadowing within funnel-like structures along the disk's rotation axis. Our models predict highly collimated radiation fields, with isotropic-equivalent luminosities vastly exceeding the Eddington limit in polar directions, and significant suppression of emission at higher inclination angles due to shadowing. These effects result in altered spectral energy distributions and pronounced anisotropies in observable properties. Key features include ultra-blue UV continuum slopes (alpha=+0.5 to +0.8), bolometric correction factors varying by over an order of magnitude with orientation, and suppressed coronal X-ray emissions. The anisotropy and shadowing effects may also explain the observed faintness of broad high-ionization emission lines, as the viewing angle strongly modulates both continuum brightness and the illumination of the broad-line region. These findings indicate that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries and anisotropic radiation fields, can naturally account for many puzzling features of JWST-discovered AGNs and provide new insights into black hole growth in the early universe.

  Effectively finding and identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies is an important step in studying black hole formation and evolution. In this work, we examine four mid-IR-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses between $M_\star \sim 10^8 - 10^9 M_\odot$ , and find that the galaxies are host to nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that are notably rare in how young and massive they are. We perform photometric measurements on the central star clusters in our target galaxies galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-IR imaging and compare their observed properties to models of stellar population evolution. We find that these galaxies are host to very massive ($\sim10^7 M_\odot$), extremely young ($\lesssim 8$ Myr), dusty ($0.6 \lesssim \mathrm{A_v} \lesssim 1.8$) nuclear star clusters. Our results indicate that these galactic nuclei have ongoing star-formation, are still at least partially obscured by clouds of gas and dust, and are most likely producing the extremely red AGN-like mid-IR colors. Moreover, prior work has shown that these galaxies do not exhibit X-ray or optical AGN signatures. Therefore, we recommend caution when using mid-IR color-color diagnostics for AGN selection in dwarf galaxies, since, as directly exemplified in this sample, they can be contaminated by massive star clusters with ongoing star formation.
