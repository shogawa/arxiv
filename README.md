  We present a novel implementation for active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback through ultra-fast winds in the code gizmo. Our feedback recipe accounts for the angular dependence of radiative feedback upon black hole spin. We self-consistently evolve in time i) the gas accretion process from resolved scales to an unresolved AGN disc, ii) the evolution of the spin of the massive black hole (MBH), iii) the injection of AGN-driven winds into the resolved scales, and iv) the spin-induced anisotropy of the overall feedback process. We test our implementation by following the propagation of the wind-driven outflow into a homogeneous medium, and we compare the results against simple analytical models. Then, we consider an isolated galaxy setup and there we study the impact of the AGN feedback on the evolution of the MBH and the of the host galaxy. We find that: i) AGN feedback limits the gas inflow that powers the MBH, with a consequent weak impact on the host galaxy characterized by a star formation (SF) suppression of about a factor of two in the nuclear region; ii) the impact of AGN feedback on the host galaxy and on MBH growth is primarily determined by the AGN luminosity, rather than by its angular pattern set by the MBH spin; iii) the imprint of the angular pattern of the AGN radiation emission manifest in a more clear way at high accretion rates. At such high rates the more isotropic angular patterns, proper to higher spin values, sweep away gas in the nuclear region more easily, hence causing a slower MBH mass and spin growths and a higher quenching of the SF. We argue that the influence of spin-dependent anisotropy of AGN feedback on MBH and galaxy evolution is likely to be relevant in those scenarios characterized by high and prolonged MBH accretion episodes and by high AGN wind-galaxy coupling. Such conditions are more frequently met in galaxy mergers and/or high redshift galaxies.

  Using deep JWST imaging from JADES, JEMS and SMILES, we characterize optically-faint and extremely red galaxies at $z&gt;3$ that were previously missing from galaxy census estimates. The data indicate the existence of abundant, dusty and post-starburst-like galaxies down to $10^8$M$_\odot$, below the sensitivity limit of Spitzer and ALMA. Modeling the NIRCam and HST photometry of these red sources can result in extreme, high values for both stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR); however, including 7 MIRI filters out to 21$\mu$m results in decreased mass (median 0.6 dex for log$_{10}$M$^*$/M$_{\odot}&gt;$10), and SFR (median 10$\times$ for SFR$&gt;$100 M$_{\odot}$/yr). At $z&gt;6$, our sample includes a high fraction of little red dots (LRDs; NIRCam-selected dust-reddened AGN candidates). We significantly measure older stellar populations in the LRDs out to rest-frame 3$\mu$m (the stellar bump) and rule out a dominant contribution from hot dust emission, a signature of AGN contamination to stellar population measurements. This allows us to measure their contribution to the cosmic census at $z&gt;3$, below the typical detection limits of ALMA ($L_{\rm IR}&lt;10^{12}L_\odot$). We find that these sources, which are overwhelmingly missed by HST and ALMA, could effectively double the obscured fraction of the star formation rate density at $4&lt;z&lt;6$ compared to some estimates, showing that prior to JWST, the obscured contribution from fainter sources could be underestimated. Finally, we identify five sources with evidence for Balmer breaks and high stellar masses at $5.5&lt;z&lt;7.7$. While spectroscopy is required to determine their nature, we discuss possible measurement systematics to explore with future data.   

An Explanation for Overrepresentation of Tidal Disruption Events in

  Tidal disruption events\,(TDEs) provide a valuable probe in studying the dynamics of stars in the nuclear environments of galaxies. Recent observations show that TDEs are strongly overrepresented in post-starburst or "green valley" galaxies, although the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. Considering the possible interaction between stars and active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disk, the TDE rates can be greatly changed compared to those in quiescent galactic nuclei. In this work, we revisit TDE rates by incorporating an evolving AGN disk within the framework of the "loss cone" theory. We numerically evolve the Fokker-Planck equations by considering the star-disk interactions, in-situ star formation in the unstable region of the outer AGN disk and the evolution of the accretion process for supermassive black holes\,(SMBHs). We find that the TDE rates are enhanced by about two orders of magnitude shortly after the AGN transitions into a non-active stage. During this phase, the accumulated stars are rapidly scattered into the loss cone due to the disappearance of the inner standard thin disk. Our results provide an explanation for the overrepresentation of TDEs in post-starburst galaxies.

  Strong iron lines are a common feature of the optical spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and quasars from $z\sim 6-7$ to the local Universe, and [Fe/Mg] ratios do not show cosmic evolution. During active episodes, accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs) inevitably form stars in the self-gravitating part and these stars accrete with high accretion rates. In this paper, we investigate the population evolution of accretion-modified stars (AMSs) to produce irons and magnesium in AGNs. The AMSs as a new type of stars are allowed to have any metallicity but without significant loss from stellar winds since the winds are choked by the dense medium of the disks and return to the core stars. Mass functions of the AMS population show a pile-up or cutoff pile-up shape in top-heavy or top-dominant forms if the stellar winds are strong, consistent with the narrow range of supernovae (SN) explosions driven by the known pair-instability. This provides an efficient way to produce metals. Meanwhile, SN explosions support an inflated disk as a dusty torus. Furthermore, the evolving top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs) lead to bright luminosity in infrared bands in dusty regions. This contributes a new component in infrared bands which is independent of the emissions from the central part of accretion disks, appearing as a long-term trending of the NIR continuum compared to optical variations. Moreover, the model can be further tested through reverberation mapping of emission lines, including LIGO/LISA detections of gravitational waves and signatures from spatially resolved observations of GRAVITY+/VLTI.

  In this paper, we investigate the astrophysical processes of stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs) embedded in advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The sMBH is undergoing Bondi accretion at a rate lower than the SMBH. Outflows from the sMBH-ADAF dynamically interact with their surroundings and form a cavity inside the SMBH-ADAF, thereby quenching the accretion onto the SMBH. Rejuvenation of the Bondi accretion is rapidly done by turbulence. These processes give rise to quasi-periodic episodes of sMBH activities and create flickerings from relativistic jets developed by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism if the sMBH is maximally rotating. Accumulating successive sMBH-outflows trigger viscous instability of the SMBH-ADAF, leading to a flare following a series of flickerings. Recently, the similarity of near-infrared flare's orbits has been found by GRAVITY/VLTI astrometric observations of Sgr A$\!^{*}$: their loci during the last 4-years consist of a ring in agreement with the well-determined SMBH mass. We apply the present model to Sgr A$\!^{*}$, which shows quasi-periodic flickerings. A SMBHH of $\sim 40 M_{\odot}$ is preferred orbiting around the central SMBH of Sgr A$\!^{*}$ from fitting radio to X-ray continuum. Such an extreme mass ratio inspiraling (EMRI) provides an excellent laboratory for LISA, Taiji and Tianqin detection of mHz gravitational waves with strains of $\sim 10^{-17}$, as well as their polarization.

  We analyze the physical properties of the gaseous intracluster medium (ICM) at the center of massive galaxy clusters with TNG-Cluster, a new cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation. Our sample contains 352 simulated clusters spanning a halo mass range of $10^{14} &lt; {\rm M}_{\rm 500c} / M_\odot &lt; 2 \times 10^{15}$ at $z=0$. We focus on the proposed classification of clusters into cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) populations, the $z=0$ distribution of cluster central ICM properties, and the redshift evolution of the CC cluster population. We analyze resolved structure and radial profiles of entropy, temperature, electron number density, and pressure. To distinguish between CC and NCC clusters, we consider several criteria: central cooling time, central entropy, central density, X-ray concentration parameter, and density profile slope. According to TNG-Cluster and with no a-priori cluster selection, the distributions of these properties are unimodal, whereby CCs and NCCs represent the two extremes. Across the entire TNG-Cluster sample at $z=0$ and based on central cooling time, the strong CC fraction is $f_{\rm SCC} = 24\%$, compared to $f_{\rm WCC} = 60\% $ and $f_{\rm NCC} = 16\%$ for weak and non-cool-cores, respectively. However, the fraction of CCs depends strongly on both halo mass and redshift, although the magnitude and even direction of the trends vary with definition. The abundant statistics of simulated high-mass clusters in TNG-Cluster enables us to match observational samples and make a comparison with data. The CC fractions from $z=0$ to $z=2$ are in broad agreement with observations, as are radial profiles of thermodynamical quantities, globally as well as split for CC versus NCC halos. TNG-Cluster can therefore be used as a laboratory to study the evolution and transformations of cluster cores due to mergers, AGN feedback, and other physical processes.

  We introduce the new TNG-Cluster project, an addition to the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. Our objective is to significantly increase the statistical sampling of the most massive and rare objects in the Universe: galaxy clusters with log(M_200c / Msun) &gt; 14.3 - 15.4 at z=0. To do so, we re-simulate 352 cluster regions drawn from a 1 Gpc volume, thirty-six times larger than TNG300, keeping entirely fixed the IllustrisTNG physical model as well as the numerical resolution. This new sample of hundreds of massive galaxy clusters enables studies of the assembly of high-mass ellipticals and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs), brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), satellite galaxy evolution and environmental processes, jellyfish galaxies, intracluster medium (ICM) properties, cooling and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback, mergers and relaxedness, magnetic field amplification, chemical enrichment, and the galaxy-halo connection at the high-mass end, with observables from the optical to radio synchrotron and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, to X-ray emission, as well as their cosmological applications. We present an overview of the simulation, the cluster sample, selected comparisons to data, and a first look at the diversity and physical properties of our simulated clusters and their hot ICM.
