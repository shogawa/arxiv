  Outflowing wind as one type of AGN feedback, which involves noncollimated ionized winds prevalent in Seyfert-1 AGNs, impacts their host galaxy by carrying kinetic energy outwards. However, the distance of the outflowing wind is poorly constrained due to a lack of direct imaging observations, which limits our understanding of their kinetic power and therefore makes the impact on the local galactic environment unclear. One potential approach involves a determination of the density of the ionized plasma, making it possible to derive the distance using the ionization parameter {\xi}, which can be measured based on the ionization state. Here, by applying a new time-dependent photoionization model, tpho, in SPEX, we define a new approach, the tpho-delay method, to calculate/predict a detectable density range for warm absorbers of NGC 3783. The tpho model solves self-consistently the time-dependent ionic concentrations, which enables us to study delayed states of the plasma in detail. We show that it is crucial to model the non-equilibrium effects accurately for the delayed phase, where the non-equilibrium and equilibrium models diverge significantly. Finally, we calculate the crossing time to consider the effect of the transverse motion of the outflow on the intrinsic luminosity variation. It is expected that future spectroscopic observations with more sensitive instruments will provide more accurate constraints on the outflow density, and thereby on the feedback energetics.

  A fundamental question of extra-galactic astronomy that is yet to be fully understood, concerns the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) and supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity with cosmic time, as well as their interplay and how it impacts galaxy evolution. A primary focus that could shed more light on these questions is the study of merging systems, comprising highly star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the earliest stages of galactic formation. However, it is essential to explore complementary selection methods across multiple wavelengths. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a sample of high-redshift ($z&gt;3$) far-infrared (far-IR) and radio-emitting galaxies in the highest possible spatial resolution. In order to select the galactic population of our interest, we selected galaxies that present relatively compact radio morphologies at 1.4 GHz as well as a far-IR spectrum that peaks in flux at $\lambda \geq 350 \, \mu m$. For these selection criteria, we used the COSMOS and ECDF-S fields, which provide high spectral and spatial resolution at a multi-wavelength scale. We derived a sample of eight galaxies that were identified either photometrically or spectroscopically at $z&gt;3$ from literature studies and by our team. A thorough investigation of available optical, near-IR, and millimetre (mm) imaging reveals a possible merging scenario in five out of eight cases in our sample. Additionally, available multi-wavelength photometry strongly suggests active star formation at the $10^3 \, M_{\odot}/yr$ level in massive systems co-hosting an active SMBH. Comparison of these results with previous studies, suggests that our selection method preferentially identifies galaxies hosting an active SMBH, as well as a strong SFG component, resulting in high SFR and IR luminosity.

  For the first time, systematic studies of dwarf galaxies are being conducted throughout the Local Volume, including Centaurus A (NGC 5128), which is the nearest elliptical galaxy. Given Centaurus As mass (roughly ten times that of the Milky Way), AGN activity, and recent major mergers, investigating these dwarfs and their star formation physics is imperative. However, simulating the faintest dwarfs in a massive galaxy like Centaurus A with sufficient resolution in a hydrodynamic simulation is computationally expensive and currently unfeasible. In this study, we seek to reproduce Centaurus A dwarfs using the same star formation physics as the Milky Way. We employ the semi-analytic model Galacticus to model dwarfs within a 600 kpc region. Utilizing astrophysical prescriptions and parameters matching the Milky Way satellites, we explore predictions for various properties and star formation histories (SFHs) to investigate environmental effects. We also reproduce cumulative luminosity and luminosity metallicity relations consistent with observations for the overall Centaurus A satellite population, while predicting half-light radii, velocity dispersion, and SFHs for the dwarf galaxies in Centaurus A. The agreement between our predicted SFHs for Centaurus A dwarfs and those of the Milky Way implies the presence of universal processes governing star formation in these galaxies. Overall, our findings shed light on the star formation physics of dwarf galaxies in the Centaurus A system, revealing insights into their properties and dependence on the host environment.

  $q - Ï‡_\mathrm{eff}$ correlation

  Current gravitational-wave data from stellar-mass black-hole binary mergers suggest a correlation between the binary mass ratio $q$ and the effective spin $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$: more unequal-mass binaries consistently show larger and positive values of the effective spin. Multiple generations of black-hole mergers in dense astrophysical environments may provide a way to form unequal-mass systems, but they cannot explain the observed correlation on their own. We show that the symmetry of the astrophysical environment is a crucial feature to shed light on this otherwise puzzling piece of observational evidence. We present a toy model that reproduces, at least qualitatively, the observed correlation. The model relies on axisymmetric, disk-like environments where binaries participating in hierarchical mergers share a preferential direction. Migration traps in AGN disks are a prime candidate for this setup, hinting at the exciting possibility of constraining their occurrence with gravitational-wave data.

  Deep observations with JWST have revealed an emerging population of red point-like sources that could provide a link between the postulated supermassive black hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work we present a JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey, of a massive accreting black hole at $z=8.50$, displaying a clear broad-line component as inferred from the H$\beta$ line with FWHM = $3439\pm413$ km s$^{-1}$, typical of the broad line region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines, and a point-source morphology. We compute the black hole mass of log$_{10}(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)=8.17\pm0.42$, and a bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol}\sim6.6\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These values imply that our object is accreting at $\sim 40\%$ of the Eddington limit. Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA, indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of log$_{10}(M_{\rm *}/M_\odot)&lt;8.7$, which would lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at least $\sim 30 \%$. This is orders of magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs, but is consistent with recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding suggests that a non-negligible fraction of supermassive black holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted number densities of high-$z$ faint AGN, future NIRSpec observations of larger samples will allow us to further investigate the galaxy-black hole co-evolution in the early Universe.

  We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies at $z\gtrsim9$ found behind the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury Program. We confirm the source redshift via emission lines and/or the Ly$\alpha$ break feature for ten galaxies at z=8.50-13.08 down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17.3$. We achieve a high confirmation rate of 100\% for $z&gt;9$ candidates reported in Atek et al. (2023). Using six sources with multiple emission line detections, we find that the offset of the redshift estimates between the lines and the Ly$\alpha$ break alone with prism can be as large as $\pm0.2$, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources. With spec-$z$ confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at $z\simeq9$-12 and find these lower limits to be consistent with recent photometric measurements. We identify at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) systems based on X-ray emission, broad line (BL) H$\beta$, high ionization line (e.g., NIV]1487, CIV1549) detections, and excess in UVLF. This requires the AGN LFs at $z\simeq$ 9-10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated at $z\sim6$ and indicates a plausible cause of the high abundance of $z&gt;9$ galaxies claimed in recent photometric studies may be AGNs. One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a dusty BL AGN at $z=8.50$ with a physical separation of 380 kpc in the source plane. These two sources show blueward Ly$\alpha$ line or continuum emission, suggesting that they reside in the same ionized bubble with a radius of $7.69\pm0.18$ pMpc. Our results imply that AGNs have a non-negligible contribution to cosmic reionization.
