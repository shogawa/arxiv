  We study the ionised gas kinematics of 293 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) hosts as compared to that of 485 control galaxies from the MaNGA-SDSS survey using measurements of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007\AA emission-line profiles, presenting flux, velocity and W$_{80}$ maps. In 45% of the AGN, a broad component was needed to fit the line profiles wings within the inner few kpc, that we have identified with an outflow. But in most AGN, the profiles are broader than that of their controls over a much more extended region, identified as the "kinematically disturbed regions" (KDRs). We find a positive correlation between the mean $\langle$W$_{80}\rangle$ and L[OIII], supporting that the KDR is due to heating and turbulence of the ISM by outflows and radiation from the AGN. The extent R$_{KDR}$ reaches up to 24kpc, with a mean ratio to that of the ENLR of 57%. We estimate ionised gas mass flow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm out}$) and kinetic powers ($\dot{E}_{\rm out}$) both from the AGN broad components and from the W$_{80}$ values, that can be obtained for the whole AGN sample. We find values for $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$ and $\dot{E}_{\rm out}$ that correlate with the AGN luminosity $L_{bol}$, populating the low luminosity end of these known correlations. The mean coupling efficiency between $\dot{E}_{\rm out}$ and AGN luminosity is $\approx$ 0.02% from the W$_{80}$ values and lower from the broad component. But the large extent of the KDR shows that even low-luminosity AGN can impact the host galaxy along several kpc in a "maintenance mode" feedback.   

An Excess of AGNs Triggered by Galaxy Mergers in MaNGA Galaxies of

  To facilitate new studies of galaxy merger driven fueling of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we present a catalog of 387 AGNs that we have identified in the final population of over $10,000$ $z&lt;0.15$ galaxies observed by the SDSS-IV integral field spectroscopy survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA). We selected the AGNs via mid-infrared WISE colors, Swift/BAT ultra hard X-ray detections, NVSS and FIRST radio observations, and broad emission lines in SDSS spectra. By combining the MaNGA AGN catalog with a new SDSS catalog of galaxy mergers that were identified based on a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxies, we study the link between galaxy mergers and nuclear activity for AGNs above a limiting bolometric luminosity of $10^{44.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find an excess of AGNs in mergers, relative to non-mergers, for galaxies with stellar mass $\sim10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$, where the AGN excess is somewhat stronger in major mergers than in minor mergers. Further, when we combine minor and major mergers and sort by merger stage, we find that the highest AGN excess occurs in post-coalescence mergers in the highest mass galaxies. However, we find no evidence of a correlation between galaxy mergers and AGN luminosity or accretion rate. In summary, while galaxy mergers overall do appear to trigger or enhance AGN activity more than non-mergers, they do not seem to induce higher levels of accretion or higher luminosities. We provide the MaNGA AGN Catalog and the MaNGA Galaxy Merger Catalog for the community here.
