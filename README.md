  The identification of red, apparently massive galaxies at $z&gt;7$ in early JWST photometry suggests a strongly accelerated timeline compared to standard models of galaxy growth. A major uncertainty in the interpretation is whether the red colors are caused by evolved stellar populations, dust, or other effects such as emission lines or AGN. Here we show that three of the massive galaxy candidates at $z=6.7-8.4$ have prominent Balmer breaks in JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the RUBIES program. The Balmer breaks demonstrate unambiguously that stellar emission dominates at $\lambda_{\rm rest} = 0.4\,\mu$m, and require formation histories extending hundreds of Myr into the past in galaxies only 600--800 Myr after the Big Bang. Two of the three galaxies also show broad Balmer lines, with H$\beta$ FWHM $&gt;2500~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting that dust-reddened AGN contribute to, or even dominate, the SEDs of these galaxies at $\lambda_{\rm rest}\gtrsim 0.6\,\mu$m. All three galaxies have relatively narrow [O III] lines, seemingly ruling out a high-mass interpretation if the lines arise in dynamically-relaxed, inclined disks. Yet, the inferred masses also remain highly uncertain. We model the high-quality spectra using Prospector to decompose the continuum into stellar and AGN components, and explore limiting cases in stellar/AGN contribution. This produces a wide range of possible stellar masses, spanning $M_\star \sim 10^9 - 10^{11}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$. Nevertheless, all fits suggest a very early and rapid formation, most of which follow with a truncation in star formation. Potential origins and evolutionary tracks for these objects are discussed, from the cores of massive galaxies to low-mass galaxies with over-massive black holes. Intriguingly, we find all of these explanations to be incomplete; deeper and redder data are needed to understand the physics of these systems.

  We present 1 - 12 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of 9 off-nuclear persistent radio sources (PRSs) in nearby (z &lt; 0.055) dwarf galaxies, along with high-resolution European very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) Network (EVN) observations for one of them at 1.7GHz. We explore the plausibility that these PRSs are associated with fast radio burst (FRB) sources by examining their properties, physical sizes, host-normalized offsets, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), radio luminosities, and light curves, and compare them to those of the PRSs associated with FRBs 20121102A and 20190520B, two known active galactic nuclei (AGN), and one likely AGN in our sample with comparable data, as well as other radio transients exhibiting characteristics analogous to FRB-PRSs. We identify a single source in our sample, J1136+2643, as the most promising FRB- PRS, based on its compact physical size and host-normalized offset. We further identify two sources, J0019+1507 and J0909+5955, with physical sizes comparable to FRB-PRSs, but which exhibit large offsets and flat spectral indices potentially indicative of a background AGN origin. We test the viability of neutron star wind nebulae and hypernebulae models for J1136+2643, and find that the physical size, luminosity, and SED of J1136+2643 are broadly consistent with these models. Finally, we discuss the alternative interpretation that the radio sources are instead powered by accreting massive black holes and outline future prospects and follow-up observations for differentiating between these scenarios.
