  The ability to disentangle the light of an AGN from its host galaxy is strongly dependent on the spatial resolution and depth of the imaging. As the capabilities of imaging systems improve with time, confirming that our standard techniques adequately model the increasingly complex structures unveiled is essential. With JWST providing unprecedented image quality, we can test how measurements of galaxy morphology vary with the choice of point-spread function (PSF) and fitting software. We perform two-component S\'ersic+PSF fits of the surface brightness profiles of 87 X-ray AGNs $(0.1 &lt; z &lt; 4)$ from the CEERS survey. We create model PSFs for NIRCam F115W imaging using both photutils and PSFEx. We find that PSFEx models consistently fail to match the radial profile of typical point sources within our sample. We then perform AGN--host decompositions on each source by creating S\'ersic+PSF models using both Galfit and AstroPhot. We find that Galfit and AstroPhot converge to different regions of the parameter space, providing consistently differing host galaxy properties. While we can measure the AGN and host magnitudes accurately, we find that the host galaxy morphological parameters are not well-determined -- the S\'ersic index and effective radius are strongly covariant. Significant changes in the host galaxy parameters do not correspond to changes in the statistical quality of fit, nor to significant changes in the model's radial profile. These results indicate that the S\'ersic profile does not uniquely well-represent typical AGN host galaxies in extragalactic survey fields. We also provide recommendations for studies of AGN hosts comparable to ours.

  The origin of the ionizing photons that completed hydrogen reionization remains debated. Using recent JWST and ground-based surveys at 4.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 6.5, we construct a unified rest-UV AGN luminosity function that separates unobscured Type I and obscured Type II populations, and show that "little red dots" and X-ray selected sources are magnitude-filtered subsets of Type I with a mixture fraction eta = 0.10 +/- 0.02. We anchor the Lyman-continuum (LyC) escape fraction to outflow incidence and geometric clearing rather than assuming quasar-like values for all classes, and propagate uncertainties through a joint fit. Integrating over -27 &lt; M_UV &lt; -17, AGN inject Ndot_ion,AGN = (3.77 +1.08/-0.95) x 10^51 s^-1 Mpc^-3, nearly twice earlier estimates and comparable to the Ly-alpha inferred requirement at z ~ 6. When combined with the JWST galaxy UV luminosity function and a harder stellar ionizing efficiency of log10(xi_ion) = 25.7, AGN contribute 31-75% of the total ionizing photons for representative galaxy escape fractions f_esc,gal = 0.03-0.20. The resulting hydrogen photoionization rate, Gamma_HI ~ (0.5-2) x 10^-12 s^-1 at z ~ 5-6, lies squarely within the Ly-alpha forest constraints once mean free paths and IGM clumpiness are accounted for, remaining consistent for combined AGN-galaxy models up to f_esc,gal &lt;= 5%. These results suggest that AGN and galaxies jointly sustained the ionizing background during the final stages of reionization, with AGN remaining a major but not exclusive contributor.

  There is evidence for significant evolution in the gaseous and dust properties of galaxies since the era of cosmic noon ($1\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$). The well known co-evolution of supermassive black holes with their host galaxies suggests a constant connection between the small-scale (nuclear) and large-scale regions of galaxies. A fundamental component of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is the "torus", a dense, dusty structure that acts as the interface between the accretion disc and the ISM of the host galaxy. The transitional nature of the torus makes it a prime subject to search for evolution since cosmic noon. We use high-resolution near- and mid-IR imaging from the JWST CEERS program to disentangle the emission from the torus in unprecedented detail for 88 X-ray selected AGN at $z\sim2$. We employ a novel SED fitting technique that combines archival low-resolution multi-band photometry at UV to FIR wavelengths with the new high-resolution JWST photometry to constrain essential AGN and torus parameters, such as accretion disc luminosity, torus opening angle, and inclination angle. We demonstrate that this SED fitting approach leads to better AGN characterisation and tighter constraints on AGN parameters. The population-level analysis finds that the Covering Fraction ($CF$) distribution peaks at $\approx0.25$ with a long tail towards higher $CF$. Despite the well-known evolution of the ISM and structural properties of AGN hosts to these redshifts, the $CF$ distribution of our sample does not show any strong statistical difference with that found in local AGN of equivalent luminosity, or with those at intermediate redshifts.   

Shooting for the stars: Jet-mode feedback and AGN jet deceleration from

  AGN jets are thought to be vital ingredients in galaxy evolution through the action of kinetic feedback; however, how narrow, relativistic outflows couple to galaxies remains an open question. Jet deceleration, which is often attributed to the entrainment of material, such as stellar winds, is thought to be necessary for efficient coupling. We present a simple model of jet deceleration due to stellar mass-loading to investigate the energy budget of direct jet feedback in the local Universe. To this end, we produce models of stellar mass-loss, including deriving a prescription for main sequence mass-loss rates as a function of stellar population age. We pair this mass-loss data with a parametric fit for radio AGN incidence, predicting that a majority of jets are decelerated within their hosts, and generally replicate the expected FR-II fraction in LERGs. We calculate that $\gtrsim$25\% of the jet power in the local Universe is efficiently decelerated and available for direct feedback within galaxies for any stellar population age. This fraction is largely invariant to the shape of the radio AGN incidence function at low jet Eddington fractions. The stellar mass-loss rate evolves significantly over time, approximately following $\tau^{-1.1}$, leading to corresponding decreases in decelerated jet power in older stellar populations. Although asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars dominate mass-loss at all ages, we find that their stochasticity is important in low-mass galaxies, and derive a critical jet power below which main sequence stars alone are sufficient to decelerate the jet.
