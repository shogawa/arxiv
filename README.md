  The stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is a fundamental relationship between galaxies and their host dark matter haloes. In this study, we examine the scatter in this relation for primary galaxies in the semi-analytic L-Galaxies model and two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, \eagle{} and \tng{}. We find that in low-mass haloes, more massive galaxies tend to reside in haloes with higher concentration, earlier formation time, greater environmental density, earlier major mergers, and, to have older stellar populations, which is consistent with findings in various studies. Quantitative analysis reveals the varying significance of halo and galaxy properties in determining SHMR scatter across simulations and models. In \eagle{} and \tng{}, halo concentration and formation time primarily influence SHMR scatter for haloes with $M_{\rm h}&lt;10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$, but the influence diminishes at high mass. Baryonic processes play a more significant role in \lgal{}. For halos with $M_{\rm h} &lt;10^{11}~\rm M_\odot$ and $10^{12}~\rm M_\odot&lt;M_{\rm h}&lt;10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, the main drivers of scatter are galaxy SFR and age. In the $10^{11.5}~\rm M_\odot&lt;M_{\rm h} &lt;10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$ range, halo concentration and formation time are the primary factors. And for halos with $M_{\rm h} &gt; 10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, supermassive black hole mass becomes more important. Interestingly, it is found that AGN feedback may increase the amplitude of the scatter and decrease the dependence on halo properties at high masses.

  A warm corona has been widely proposed to explain the soft X-ray excess (SE) above the 2--10 keV power law extrapolation in AGNs. In actual spectral fittings, the warm coronal seed photon temperature ($T_{\rm s}$) is usually assumed to be far away from the soft X-ray, but $kT_{\rm s}$ can reach close to 0.1 keV in standard accretion disc model. In this study, we used Monte Carlo simulations to obtain radiation spectra from a slab-like warm corona and fitted the spectra using the spherical-geometry-based routine \textsc{thcomp} or a thermal component. Our findings reveal that high $T_{\rm s}$ can influence the fitting results. A moderately high $kT_{\rm s}$ (around 0.03 keV) can result in an apparent low-temperature and flat SE, while an extremely high $kT_{\rm s}$ (around 0.07 keV) can even produce an unobserved blackbody-like SE. Our conclusions indicate that, for spectral fittings of the warm coronal radiation (SE in AGNs), $kT_{\rm s}$ should be treated as a free parameter with an upper limit, and an accurate coronal geometry is necessary when $kT_{\rm s}&gt;0.01$ keV.

  In this work, we propose a deep learning-based classification model of astronomical objects using alerts reported by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. The model takes as inputs sequences of stamp images and metadata contained in each alert, as well as features from the All-WISE catalog. The proposed model, called temporal stamp classifier, is able to discriminate between three classes of astronomical objects: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Super-Novae (SNe) and Variable Stars (VS), with an accuracy of approximately 98% in the test set, when using 2 to 5 detections. The results show that the model performance improves with the addition of more detections. Simple recurrence models obtain competitive results with those of more complex models such as LSTM.We also propose changes to the original stamp classifier model, which only uses the first detection. The performance of the latter model improves with changes in the architecture and the addition of random rotations, achieving a 1.46% increase in test accuracy.

  Kpc-scale dual and offset Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are signposts of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) triggered during late-stage galaxy mergers, offering crucial insights into the coevolution of SMBHs and galaxies. However, robustly confirmed systems at high redshift (e.g., $z&gt;1$) are scarce and biased towards the most luminous and unobscured systems. In this study, we systematically search for kpc-scale (projected separation $&lt;15$ kpc) dual and offset AGNs around 571 moderate-luminosity, X-ray-selected AGNs including the obscured population, utilizing deep HST ACS/F814W and multiband JWST NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey. We identify 59 dual and 30 offset AGN candidates in late stage major mergers based on spatially-resolved spectral energy distribution analyses. This translates to $\sim28$ and $\sim10$ bona-fide dual and offset AGNs using a probabilistic pair counting scheme to minimize chance superpositions. Notably, the fraction of dual and offset AGNs among moderate-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}\sim10^{43}-10^{46}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$), obscured AGNs is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the most luminous, unobscured quasar pairs. We find tentative evidence for an increasing pair fraction among AGNs with redshift (from a few percent at $z\sim 0.5$ to $\sim22.9_{-17.7}^{+27.5}\%$ at $z\sim4.5$) and a higher occurrence rate of dual over offset AGNs. There is no pileup of dual/offset AGNs below $\sim 2~{\rm kpc}$ separations. These results generally align with predictions from the ASTRID and Horizon-AGN cosmological simulations when matching sample selection criteria, implying a high probability of both BHs being active simultaneously in late-stage major mergers.
