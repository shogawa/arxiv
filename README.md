  The variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is ubiquitous but has not yet been understood. Measuring the optical variation properties of AGNs, such as variation timescale and amplitude, and then correlating them with their fundamental physical parameters, have long served as a critical way of exploring the origin of AGN variability and the associated physics of the accretion process in AGNs. Obtaining accurate variation properties of AGNs is thus essential. It has been found that the damped random walk (DRW) process can well describe the AGN optical variation, however, there is a controversy over how long a minimal monitoring baseline is required to obtain unbiased variation properties. In this work, we settle the controversy by exhaustively scrutinizing the complex combination of assumed priors, adopted best-fit values, ensemble averaging methods, and fitting methods. Then, the newly proposed is an optimized solution where unbiased variation properties of an AGN sample possessing the same variation timescale can be obtained with a minimal baseline of about 10 times their variation timescale. Finally, the new optimized solution is used to demonstrate the positive role of time domain surveys to be conducted by the Wide Field Survey Telescope in improving constraints on AGN variation properties.

  Recent observations with JWST and ALMA have revealed extremely massive quiescent galaxies at redshifts of z=3 and higher, indicating both rapid onset and quenching of star formation. Using the cosmological simulation suite Magneticum Pathfinder we reproduce the observed number densities and stellar masses, with 36 quenched galaxies of stellar mass larger than 3e10Msun at z=3.42. We find that these galaxies are quenched through a rapid burst of star-formation and subsequent AGN feedback caused by a particularly isotropic collapse of surrounding gas, occurring on timescales of around 200Myr or shorter. The resulting quenched galaxies host stellar components which are kinematically fast rotating and alpha-enhanced, while exhibiting a steeper metallicity and flatter age gradient compared to galaxies of similar stellar mass. The gas of the galaxies has been metal enriched and ejected. We find that quenched galaxies do not inhabit the densest nodes, but rather sit in local underdensities. We analyze observable metrics to predict future quenching at high redshifts, finding that on shorter timescales &lt;500Myr the ratio M_bh/M_* is the best predictor, followed by the burstiness of the preceding star-formation, t50-t90 (time to go from 50% to 90% stellar mass). On longer timescales, &gt;1Gyr, the environment becomes the strongest predictor, followed by t50-t90, indicating that at high redshifts the consumption of old and lack of new gas are more relevant for long-term prevention of star-formation than the presence of a massive AGN. We predict that relics of such high-z quenched galaxies should best be characterized by a strong alpha enhancement.

  Feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is believed to be a critical driver of the observed quenching of star formation and color bimodality of galaxies above the Milky Way mass scale. In recent years, various forms of SMBH feedback have been implemented as subgrid models in galaxy formation simulations, but most implementations have involved simplified prescriptions or coarse-grained models of the interstellar medium (ISM). We present the first set of FIRE-3 cosmological zoom-in simulations with AGN feedback evolved to $z\sim0$, examining a set of galaxies with halos in the mass range $10^{12}-10^{13}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$. These high-resolution simulations combine detailed stellar and ISM physics with multi-channel AGN feedback including radiative feedback, mechanical outflows, and in some simulations, cosmic rays. We find that massive (&gt;L*) galaxies in these simulations can match local scaling relations including the stellar mass-halo mass relation, the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma$ relation, the size-mass relation, and the Faber-Jackson relation. Many of the massive galaxies in the simulations with AGN feedback have quenched star formation and elliptical morphologies, in qualitative agreement with observations. In contrast, simulations at the massive end without AGN feedback produce galaxies that are too massive and form stars at too high rates, are order-of-magnitude too compact, and have velocity dispersions well above Faber-Jackson. Despite these successes, the AGN physics models analyzed do not necessarily produce uniformly realistic galaxies across the full mass range studied when the feedback parameters are held constant, indicating that further refinements of the black hole modeling may be warranted.

  We use VLT-MUSE integral field unit data, to study the ionized gas physical properties and kinematics, as well as the stellar populations of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 232. The data cover a field of view of 60"x60" at a spatial resolution of ~850 pc. The emission-line profiles have been fitted with two Gaussian components, one associated to the emission of the gas in the disc and the other due to a bi-conical outflow. The spectral synthesis reveals a predominant old stellar population with ages exceeding 2 Gyr, with the largest contributions seen at the nucleus and decreasing outwards. Meanwhile, the young and intermediate age stellar populations exhibit a positive gradient with increasing radius and a circum-nuclear star forming ring with radius of ~0.5 kpc traced by stars younger than 20 Myr, is observed. This, along with the fact that AGN and SF dominated regions present similar gaseous oxygen abundances, suggests a shared reservoir feeding both star formation and the AGN. We have estimated a maximum outflow rate in ionized gas of ~1.26 M_{sun}/yr observed at a distance of ~560 pc from the nucleus. The corresponding maximum kinetic power of the outflow is ~3.4x10^{41} erg/s. This released energy could be sufficient to suppress star formation within the ionization cone, as evidenced by the lower star formation rates observed in this region.
