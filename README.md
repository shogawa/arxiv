  Radio-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are common in elliptical galaxies and AGN feedback is one of the possible mechanisms for regulating star formation in massive galaxies. It is unclear if all passive galaxy populations host radio AGNs and if AGN feedback is a plausible mechanism for truncating or regulating star formation in these galaxies. To determine if radio AGNs are common in passive spiral galaxies, we have measured the radio emission of 38 low-redshift passive spiral galaxies using RACS-low at 887.5 MHz and VLASS at 3 GHz. We selected a subset of 2MRS galaxies with negligible WISE 12 $\mu$m emission from warm dust, and spiral morphologies from HyperLeda, RC3, 2MRS and manual inspection. In contrast to comparable early-type galaxies, our sample has no significant radio detections, with radio flux densities below 1 mJy, implying that radio AGNs are rare or non-existent in passive spirals. Using the combined radio images and assuming radio luminosity is proportional to $K$-band luminosity, we find ${\rm log}~L_\nu \lesssim 9.01-0.4~M_K$. This falls below the radio luminosities of passive elliptical galaxies, implying radio luminosity in passive galaxies is correlated with host galaxy morphology and kinematics.

  Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.

  We present the 4MOST IR AGN survey, the first large-scale optical spectroscopic survey characterizing mid-infrared (MIR) selected obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). The survey targets $\approx 212,000$ obscured infrared (IR) AGN candidates over $\approx 10,000 \rm \: deg^2$ down to a magnitude limit of $r_{\rm AB}=22.8 \, \rm mag$ and will be $\approx 100 \times$ larger than any existing obscured IR AGN spectroscopic sample. We select the targets using a MIR colour criterion applied to the unWISE catalogue from the WISE all-sky survey, and then apply a $r-W2\geq 5.9 \rm \: mag$ cut; we demonstrate that this selection will mostly identify sources obscured by $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{22} \rm \: cm^{-2}$. The survey complements the 4MOST X-ray survey, which will follow up $\sim 1\rm M$ eROSITA-selected (typically unobscured) AGN. We perform simulations to predict the quality of the spectra that we will obtain and validate our MIR-optical colour-selection method using X-ray spectral constraints and UV-to-far IR spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling in four well-observed deep-sky fields. We find that: (1) $\approx 80-87\%$ of the WISE-selected targets are AGN down to $r_{\rm AB}=22.1-22.8 \: \rm mag$ of which $\approx 70\%$ are obscured by $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{22} \: \rm cm^{-2}$, and (2) $\approx 80\%$ of the 4MOST IR AGN sample will remain undetected by the deepest eROSITA observations due to extreme absorption. Our SED fitting results show that the 4MOST IR AGN survey will primarily identify obscured AGN and quasars ($\approx 55\%$ of the sample is expected to have $L_{\rm AGN,IR}&gt;10^{45} \rm \: erg \: s^{-1}$) residing in massive galaxies ($M_{\star}\approx 10^{10}-10^{12} \rm \: M_{\odot}$) at $z\approx 0.5-3.5$ with $ \approx 33\%$ expected to be hosted by starburst galaxies.

  Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promissing pathway for forming supermassive black holes (BHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) cooling during primordial star formation via intense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in overdense regions. However, non-detection of 21 cm signals from the EoR reported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests that such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local universe, promoting H$_2$ production and thereby potentially quenching massive BH seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model incorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong X-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct collapse and leads most halos to experience H$_2$ cooling. Nevertheless, massive BH seeds with $M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^4~M_\odot$ still form by $z\simeq 15$, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their abundance reaches $\sim 10^{-4}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ sufficient to explain the SMBHs identified by JWST spectroscopy at $3&lt;z&lt;6$. While the formation of highly overmassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by X-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of $\simeq 0.01-0.1$ were already established at seeding.

  This study focuses on high-redshift, z &gt; 3, quasars where resolved X-ray jets remain underexplored in comparison to nearby sources. Building upon previous work, we identify and confirm extended kpc-scale jets emission in two quasars (J1405+0415, z = 3.215 ; J1610+1811, z = 3.122) through meticulous analysis of Chandra X-ray data. To deepen our understanding, high-resolution radio follow- up observations were conducted to constrain relativistic parameters, providing valuable insights into the enthalpy flux of these high-redshift AGN jets. The investigation specifically aims to test the X-ray emission mechanism in these quasars by exploring the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background (IC/CMB) photons by synchrotron-emitting electrons. Our novel method uses a prior to make a Bayesian estimate of the unknown angle of the jet to our line of sight, thus breaking the usual degeneracy of the bulk Lorentz factor and the Doppler beaming factor.

  The wide-area component of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is currently the largest radio survey ever carried out, and a large fraction of the 4.5 million radio sources it contains have been optically identified with galaxies or quasars with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts. Identification of radio-luminous AGN from this LoTSS source catalogue is not only important from the point of view of understanding the accretion history of the universe, but also enables a wide range of other science. However, at present the vast majority of the optical identifications lack spectroscopic information or well-sampled spectral energy distributions. We show that colour and absolute magnitude information from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) allows for the robust and efficient selection of radio AGN candidates, generating a radio AGN candidate sample of around 600,000 objects with flux density $&gt; 1.1$ mJy, spanning 144-MHz luminosities between $10^{21}$ and $10^{29}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. We use the catalogue to constrain the total sky density of radio-luminous AGN and the evolution of their luminosity function between $z=0$ and $z\approx 1$, and show that the typical mass of their host galaxies, around $10^{11} M_\odot$, is essentially independent of radio luminosity above around $L_{144} \approx 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Combining with Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) data, we show that the core prominences, radio spectral indices and variability of extended sources from the sample are qualitatively consistent with the expectations from unified models. A catalogue of the radio AGN candidates is released with this paper.

  Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) are considered to be in a co-evolution phase, with the associated active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dust and gas. Although the DOGs are thought to harbor rapidly growing SMBHs, their X-ray statistical properties, crucial for understanding the properties of obscuring gas as well as the accretion disk state and the hot electron corona around the SMBHs, remain unexplored due to the combination of the low number density of DOGs and the lack of X-ray surveys achieving both of the wide-area and uniformly high-sensitivity observations. We construct a sample of X-ray-detected DOGs in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field and examine their X-ray statistical properties. By using Subaru/HSC SSP, VIKING, and WISE all-sky surveys, our results reveal the discovery of 5738 IR-bright DOGs in the footprint covered by both of the eFEDS and VIKING surveys (60 deg^2), with 65 objects identified as X-ray-detected DOGs (eFEDS-DOGs). Among them, 41 eFEDS-DOGs show a power-law slope in the near to mid-IR bands (power-law DOGs), indicating dust-obscured AGN. The hydrogen column density (N_H) suggests that eFEDS-DOGs cover even unobscured AGN, spanning 10^20 &lt; N_H &lt;= 10^23. On the other hand, the majority of IR-bright DOGs are not detected by eROSITA, suggesting that most IR-bright DOGs are heavily obscured by dust and gas with N_H &gt; 10^23. Therefore, eFEDS-DOGs, discovered thanks to the wide-area survey by eROSITA, are newly found populations showing less obscured phases among the lifetime of DOGs. Additionally, some eFEDS-DOGs exhibit deviations, down to nearly 1.0 dex below the monochromatic luminosity at 6 micron versus absorption-corrected intrinsic X-ray luminosity between 0.5-2 keV relation, suggesting that it may signal high Eddington ratios reaching the Eddington limit.

  We investigate the response of warm absorbers to variations in the ionizing continuum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 using time-resolved X-ray observations from the \textit{Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer} (\textit{NICER}). In this work, we have demonstrated we can perform time-resolved spectroscopic studies of warm absorbers of about $\sim 5500$ s time resolution using NICER data. We have extracted 15 spectra for this source, corresponding to 15 different visits to the source, or pointings, each separated by a longer Earth occultation. By modeling the spectral variability of the warm absorber with the \texttt{{\sc {\sc warmabs}}} analytic model, we detect significant variations in the ionization parameter that correlate with changes in the ionizing flux. A time lag of approximately 5500 seconds is observed between the flux variations and the absorber's ionization response, suggesting that the gas is out of photoionization equilibrium during these periods. Using this time lag, we estimate the lower limit of the gas density $8.91 \times 10^6 \, \text{cm}^{-3}$ and constrain the location of the warm absorber to within $7.02 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}$ ($\sim 0.02$ parsec) from the central black hole. This study uses time-resolved spectral analysis to contribute to our understanding of the physical conditions of ionized AGN outflows, such as density and location.

  The cosmic star-formation rate density, molecular gas density and the AGN activity of the Universe peak at z~ 2-3, showing the Universe is most active at this epoch. The nature of the galaxies at these redshifts and their properties as a function of their environment are particularly interesting to understand the mechanisms driving their star-formation and quenching. At z~ 2.5, a massive (~ 4.8 X 10^15 Msun) proto-supercluster, Hyperion, was identified Cucciati et al. 2018, consisting of 7 groups/peaks and extending over a comoving volume of 60 X 60 X 150 Mpc^3, providing an excellent laboratory to probe the properties and evolution of galaxies as a function of their environments. We use a large compilation of photometric (optical to radio wavelengths, COSMOS2020, COSMOS-Super-deblended, and, A3COSMOS) and spectroscopic (C3VO, HST-Hyperion, VUDS, zCOSMOS, DEIMOS10K, MAGAZ3NE) data to assign membership and study the relation between the local environment and the molecular gas mass, the star-formation rate (SFR), gas depletion timescales, and quenching mechanisms. We find that the depletion timescales and the molecular gas fractions decrease and SFR increases in denser environments at the ~ 2 sigma level, suggesting accelerated evolution in the densest regions of this proto-supercluster resulting from gas stripping, over-consumption, and/or cessation of cold flows. Dedicated observations at sub-millimeter wavelengths enabling further spectroscopic confirmation and better coverage in the sub-millimetric (sub-mm) wavelengths can provide more conclusive results on the environmental implications on gas reservoirs of galaxies in Hyperion.

  Observations indicate that early-type galaxies exhibit varying slopes in the relation between their central stellar surface density and stellar mass ($\Sigma_1 - M_{\star}$). Low-mass galaxies tend to follow a steep slope, close to one, while the slope flattens for high-mass early type galaxies. In our study, we investigate the $\Sigma_1 - M_{\star}$ scaling relation and its evolution using the NIHAO suite of cosmological simulations and compare our findings with recent results from the MaNGA survey. Our analysis shows that NIHAO galaxies successfully reproduce the observed scaling relation based on MANGA survey. Our analysis suggests that AGN feedback plays a critical role in flattening the $\Sigma_1$ slope by expelling gas from galactic centers, leading to a decrease in both stellar and dark matter density as the gravitational potential becomes shallower. To further support our findings, we conducted high-resolution N-body simulations, which confirmed that   ({\it sudden}) gas removal does substantially alter the stellar density in the central region, consistent with results from NIHAO. Furthermore, our numerical experiments show that even if the same amount of gas is re-accreted on a typical ({\it longer}) free-fall time, it is not able to restore the original stellar density. Our study concludes that AGN feedback assisted gas removal presents a plausible explanation for the decline in central stellar surface density as observed in massive elliptical galaxies.

  The ALMACAL-22 survey includes over 2700 hours of observations of ALMA phase and amplitude calibrators, spanning frequencies from 84 to 950 GHz across bands 3 to 10. In total, 687 out of the 1,047 calibrators have redshifts confirmed with spectroscopy and we find an additional 50 featureless blazars. The redshift distribution of the ALMACAL-22 sample peaks at $z \approx 1$ and spans a wide range, from the nuclei of nearby galaxies at $z \ll 0.01$ to quasars at $z = 3.742$. 70 new VLT/X-Shooter spectra of these sources covering UV to NIR wavelengths are also presented, which will be used in future stacking experiments to search for cold gas in the circumgalactic medium. Infrared magnitudes from WISE indicate that the majority of the sources are consistent with being quasars or blazars. After fitting the radio spectral energy distributions of the calibrators, we find that most ALMA calibrators exhibit peaked spectra or are re-triggered which is surprising given the large number of blazars in the sample. The peak frequencies span three orders of magnitude from 100 MHz to 170 GHz, corresponding to linear sizes ranging from sub-pc to $&gt;$ 10 kpc. In the future, when combined with high-resolution radio imaging, these results will offer valuable constraints on the molecular gas content of the CGM, as well as the ages and duty cycles of AGN jets. The ever-growing ALMACAL data set will remain an indispensable resource for studying the various aspects of galaxy formation and evolution.

  Dynamical friction (DF) may affect the dynamics of stars moving through dense media. This is the case for stars and compact objects (COs) crossing active galactic nuclei (AGN) discs, stellar clusters, and common envelopes (CE), driving stellar migration. DF may decelerate the moving stellar object and may also, under certain conditions, produce an acceleration. In this paper, we study the DF and its effects in the interaction between a star and the ambient gaseous medium through a set of two-dimensional, hydrodynamical numerical simulations using a wind tunnel configuration. Three different stellar wind configurations are considered: isotropic, polar, and equatorial. We confirm that the DF can decelerate and accelerate the star and find the critical value of the normalized velocity ($u_c$) that marks the transition between these regimes, for the three wind profiles. The value of $u_c$ for the isotropic wind differs slightly from that obtained in the thin shell approximation; for an aspherical wind, it may either be larger or smaller. Aspherical winds with small $u$ values produce larger accelerations than isotropic winds, while at high $u$ values, they lead to greater deceleration than the isotropic case. The timescale for DF to substantially affect the velocity of a stellar object is calculated. It is shown to be relevant in AGN discs and CEs.
