  Massive quiescent galaxies in the young universe are expected to be quenched rapidly, but it is unclear whether they all experience starbursts before quenching and what physical mechanism drives rapid quenching. We study 16 massive quiescent galaxies ($\log(M_\star/M_\odot) &gt; 10$) at $z\sim2$ selected from a representative sample of the Blue Jay survey. We reconstruct their star formation histories by fitting spectral energy distribution models to the JWST/NIRSpec $R\sim1000$ spectra. We find that massive quiescent galaxies can be split into three categories with roughly equal numbers of galaxies according to their SFHs: 1) Relatively old galaxies quenched at early epochs; 2) Galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a flat or bursty formation history (depending on the assumed prior); 3) Galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a major starburst. Most recently quenched galaxies show neutral gas outflows, probed by blueshifted $\rm Na\,I\,D$ absorption, and ionized gas emission, with line ratios consistent with active galactic nucleus (AGN) diagnostics. This suggests that AGN activity drives multi-phase gas outflows, leading to rapid quenching. By tracing back the SFHs of the entire sample, we predict the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at $z=4-6$: $n=3.0\pm1.4\times10^{-5}\,\rm Mpc^{-3}$. The two oldest massive quiescent galaxies in our sample appear to have extremely early formation and quenching ($z\gtrsim6$), possibly descendants of early post-starbursts at $z&gt;3$. These galaxies still show neutral gas reservoirs and low-level star formation, consistent with weak H$\alpha$ emission, perhaps because the ejective AGN feedback that caused rapid quenching has weakened over time.

  We present a catalog of hard X-ray serendipitous sources detected in the first 80 months of observations by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). The NuSTAR serendipitous survey 80-month (NSS80) catalog has an unprecedented $\sim$ 62 Ms of effective exposure time over 894 unique fields (a factor of three increase over the 40-month catalog), with an areal coverage of $\sim $36 deg$^2$, larger than all NuSTAR extragalactic surveys. NSS80 provides 1274 hard X-ray sources in the $3-24$ keV band (822 new detections compared to the previous 40-month catalog). Approximately 76% of the NuSTAR sources have lower-energy ($&lt;10$ keV) X-ray counterparts from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift-XRT. We have undertaken an extensive campaign of ground-based spectroscopic follow-up to obtain new source redshifts and classifications for 427 sources. Combining these with existing archival spectroscopy provides redshifts for 550 NSS80 sources, of which 547 are classified. The sample is primarily composed of active galactic nuclei (AGN), detected over a large range in redshift ($z$ = 0.012-3.43), but also includes 58 spectroscopically confirmed Galactic sources. In addition, five AGN/galaxy pairs, one dual AGN system, one BL Lac candidate, and a hotspot of 4C 74.26 (radio quasar) have been identified. The median rest-frame $10-40$ keV luminosity and redshift of the NSS80 are $\langle{L_\mathrm{10-40 keV}}\rangle$ = 1.2 $\times$ 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $\langle z \rangle = 0.56$. We investigate the optical properties and construct composite optical spectra to search for subtle signatures not present in the individual spectra, finding an excess of redder BL AGN compared to optical quasar surveys predominantly due to the presence of the host-galaxy and, at least in part, due to dust obscuration.

  The most active phases of star formation and black hole accretion are strongly affected by dust extinction, making far-infrared (far-IR) observations the best way to disentangle and study the co-evolution of galaxies and super massive black holes. The plethora of fine structure lines and emission features from dust, ionised and neutral atomic and warm molecular gas in the rest-frame mid- and far-IR provide unmatched diagnostic power to determine the properties of gas and dust, measure gas-phase metallicities and map cold galactic outflows in even the most obscured galaxies. By combining multi-band photometric surveys with low and high-resolution far-IR spectroscopy, the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA), a concept for a far-IR, 1.8m-diameter, cryogenically cooled observatory, will revolutionise the field of galaxy evolution by taking advantage of this IR toolkit to find and study dusty galaxies across galactic time. In this work, we make use of the phenomenological simulation SPRITZ and the Santa Cruz semi-analytical model to describe how a moderately deep multi-band PRIMA photometric survey can easily reach beyond previous IR missions to detect and study galaxies down to $10^{11}\,L_{\odot}$ beyond cosmic noon and at least up to z=4, even in the absence of gravitational lensing. By decomposing the spectral energy distribution (SED) of these photometrically selected galaxies, we show that PRIMA can be used to accurately measure the relative AGN power, the mass fraction contributed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and the total IR luminosity. At the same time, spectroscopic follow up with PRIMA will allow to trace both the star formation and black hole accretion rates (SFR, BHAR), the gas phase metallicities and the mass outflow rates of cold gas in hundreds to thousands of individual galaxies to z=2.

  Within the mass range of $10^{16}-5\times 10^{18}$ g, primordial black holes (PBHs) persist as plausible candidates for dark matter. Our study involves a reassessment of the constraints on PBHs through a comparative analysis of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and the emissions arising from their Hawking evaporation. We identify previously overlooked radiation processes across the relevant energy bands, potentially refining the bounds on PBHs. These processes encompass the direct emission from Hawking radiation, in-flight annihilation, the final state of radiation, and positronium annihilation. Thorough consideration is given to all these processes and their respective emission fractions, followed by a precise calculation of the $\mathcal{D}$ factor for observations directed towards the high-latitude Galactic contribution. Furthermore, we integrate the flux originating from extragalactic sources, both of which contribute to the measured isotropic flux. Through a comparative analysis of data derived from previous CXB observations utilizing an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) double power-law model, we establish the most stringent constraints for PBHs, thereby excluding the possibility of PBHs constituting the entire dark matter mass within the range of $2.5\times 10^{17}-3 \times 10^{17} $g.
