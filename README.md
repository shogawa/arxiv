  We present new ALMA observations of the CO(3-2) transition and 854micron continuum at 0.06-0.3" resolution, together with new VLT/SINFONI observations of NGC7172. This is a luminous (bolometric luminosity of ~10^44 erg/s) Seyfert galaxy that belongs to the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). The CO(3-2) observations reveal the presence of a highly inclined cold molecular gas ring with an approximate radius of 3-4"~540-720 pc, which is likely associated with an inner Lindblad resonance of a putative stellar bar. There are noncircular motions in the VLT/SINFONI [SiVI]1.96micron and H2 at 2.12micron, and ALMA CO(3-2) velocity fields. After subtracting the stellar velocity field, we detected [SiVI] blueshifted velocities of a few hundred km/s to the south of the AGN. They trace outflowing ionized gas outside the plane of the galaxy and out to projected distances of ~200 pc. The CO(3-2) position-velocity diagram along the kinematic minor axis displays noncircular motions with observed velocities of up to ~150 km/s. Assuming that these are taking place in the disk of the galaxy, the observed velocity signs imply that the molecular gas ring is not only rotating but also outflowing. We derived an integrated cold molecular gas mass outflow rate of ~40 Msun/yr for the ring. Using the 854micron map, we resolved a 32 pc radius torus with a gas mass of 8x10^5 Msun. These torus properties are similar to other Seyfert galaxies in the GATOS sample. We measured a decreased cold molecular gas concentration in the nuclear-torus region relative to the circumnuclear region when compared to other less luminous Seyfert galaxies. We conclude that the effects of AGN feedback in NGC7172, which are likely caused by the AGN wind and/or the moderate luminosity radio jet, are seen as a large-scale outflowing molecular gas ring and accompanying redistribution of molecular gas in the nuclear regions.

  We studied the spectral signature of different components of the Diffuse X-ray Background (DXB), including Local Hot Bubble (LHB), Solar Wind Charge Exchange (SWCX), Galactic Halo, and typically unresolved point sources (galaxies and AGN), in the direction of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) using the 4 Ms XMM-Newton survey and Chandra 4 Ms Source Catalog. In this paper, we present our results showing how the different components contribute to the DXB below 1 keV. In particular, we have found that ~6% of the emission at 3/4 keV (all-sky average value ~ 3$\times10^{-3}$ cm$^{-6}$pc), which is typically associated with Galactic Halo (GH) and Circum-galactic medium (CGM) is, in fact, due to emission from typically unresolved galaxies.   We will discuss the effect that this has on our understanding of GH and CGM, and to our understanding of the missing CGM baryons.

  We study a new population of extremely red objects (EROs) recently discovered by JWST based on their NIRCam colors F277W$-$F444W $&gt;1.5$ mag. We find 37 EROs in the CEERS field with F444W $&lt;28$ mag and photometric redshifts between $5&lt;z&lt;7$, with median $z=6.9^{+1.0}_{-1.6}$. Surprisingly, despite their red long-wavelength colors, these EROs have blue short-wavelength colors (F150W$-$F200W$\sim$0 mag) indicative of bimodal SEDs with a red, steep slope in the rest-frame optical, and a blue, flat slope in the rest-frame UV. Moreover, all these EROs are unresolved, point-like sources in all NIRCam bands. We analyze the spectral energy distributions of 8 of them with MIRI and NIRSpec observations using stellar population models and AGN templates. We find that a dusty galaxy or an obscured AGN provide similarly good SED fits but different stellar properties: massive and dusty, log M/M_sun$\sim$10 and A$_{\rm V}\gtrsim3$ mag, or low mass and obscuration, log M/M_sun$\sim$7.5 and A$_{\rm V}\sim0$ mag, hosting an obscured QSO. SED modeling does not favor either scenario, but their unresolved sizes are more suggestive of an AGN. If any EROs are confirmed to have log M/M_sun$\gtrsim10.5$, it would increase pre-JWST number densities at $z&gt;7$ by up to a factor $\sim$60. Similarly, if they are OSOs with luminosities in the L$_{\rm bol}&gt;10^{46-47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ range, their number would exceed that of bright blue QSOs by more than two orders of magnitude. Additional photometry at mid-IR wavelengths will reveal the true nature of the red continuum emission in these EROs and will place this puzzling population in the right context of galaxy evolution.
