  High-resolution spectra provide a powerful tool in studying the associated absorption lines (AALs) in quasars. We present a case study of the quasar J014741-030247 at $z \sim$ 4.75, which hosts complex intrinsic absorption lines revealed by the high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectrum obtained from the HIERACHY program. We focus on one of the strongest absorption systems ($z$ $\sim$ 4.7804) and determine the column densities of multiple ionization species. We find that the Apparent Optical Depth method may significantly underestimate the column densities of high ions. Decomposing the absorption into multiple components yields a better fit and reveals clear evidence of partial coverage. The variation in covering fractions among different ions suggests that high ions are distributed more extensively in this system. We estimate electron densities of different components ($630 - 4070 \ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), these are based on the column densities of \ion{Si}{2}* and \ion{C}{2}*. By combining these with the hydrogen number density and ionization parameter derived from photoionization modeling, we infer that the different components are located at distances of 2.3 to 9.5 kpc from the quasar. The derived $N_{\mathrm H} / n_{\mathrm e}$ and the partial coverage observed in low ions all require cloud sizes smaller than 1 pc, even down to 0.01 pc. Finally, the low kinetic luminosity of the gas ($&lt; 0.5\% L_\mathrm{bol}$) indicates that it is insufficient to drive significant AGN feedback and may only suppress star formation via `multistage' mechanism.

  The active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disks are ideal sites for hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers. To robustly probe such a possibility, we analyze binary black hole mergers in the GWTC-4 with a flexible mixture population model for component masses, spin magnitudes, and spin tilt angles, and identify two distinct subpopulations. In the second subpopulation characterized by high spin magnitudes $\chi\sim 0.8$ as well as the broad mass distribution up to $\gtrsim 150M_\odot$, we find a pronounced preference for spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum: an isotropic tilt distribution is strongly disfavored (logarithmic Bayes factor = 4.5). The aligned events account for $\sim 0.57^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$ of the second subpopulation, corresponding to a local rate of $\sim 0.25^{+0.38}_{-0.16} ~ {\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ (all values reflect central 90\% credible intervals). These notable features naturally arise from hierarchical mergers embedded in AGN disks, where gas torques can effectively align spins. Our results identify AGN-disk hierarchical assembly as an important channel in the present gravitational-wave sample and provide concrete, testable predictions for future detection.

  We perform milliarcsecond X-ray astrometry of the quadruply lensed radio-quiet quasar GraL J065904.1+162909 (J0659). This z = 3.083 quasar is lensed into four images and was discovered with the second Data Release of the Gaia Space Observatory (Gaia DR2). The methodology of using gravitational lenses as high resolution telescopes has been applied, so far, to five lensed quasars (including J0659) and shows potential to elucidate the spatial origin of the X-ray and optical emitting regions in distant quasars. We use Gaia DR3 and HST observations of J0659 and infer a mass model for the deflector that reproduces the positions of the quasar lensed images to milliarcsecond precision. Next, we apply archival Chandra observations of J0659, together with our lens model, to conduct a Bayesian test evaluating whether the X-ray emitting region coincides with the optical source position predicted by our mass model. We constrain the origin of the X-ray emission to be within a 0.''030 x 0.''020 ellipse at the 99.7% level, finding the maximum possible distance between the X-ray and optical source is 44.7 milliarcseconds. Our methodology enhances Chandra's spatial resolution at high-z by a factor of 6. We provide a novel approach that extends the methodology towards investigating the origin of the soft and hard X-ray emitting regions in lensed quasars. We elaborate on the potential of upcoming broadband and spectrally resolved X-ray astrometric studies to probe complex quasar morphology at high-z and to identify dual and binary AGN candidates.

  To investigate the population of massive black holes in dwarf galaxies, we conduct a systematic search for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using data from the first data release of the eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1). We crossmatch dwarf galaxy positions in the NASA-Sloan Atlas with X-ray sources from eRASS and apply rigorous criteria to remove contaminants such as background sources, galaxies with dubious stellar masses, and X-ray binaries. Potential contamination from ultraluminous X-ray sources is also assessed. We ultimately assemble a sample of 27 X-ray-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses $M_{*} = 10^{7.5-9.5} M_{\odot}$ and redshifts $z&lt;0.15$. An analysis of the host galaxy properties reveals that the AGN candidates are predominantly situated in systems with $g-r$ colors, star formation rates, and concentrations typical of the broader dwarf galaxy population. Detailed examination of the X-ray sources indicates that most AGN candidates in our sample are consistent with being located in the nuclear regions of their host galaxies and exhibit Eddington ratios ranging between $\lambda_{Edd} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-1}$, with a few radiating at/above their Eddington limit. Notably, our methodology identifies 15 previously unreported AGNs candidates, highlighting the complementary nature of our approach to the existing literature.
