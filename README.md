  Understanding the co-evolution of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies remains a key challenge of extragalactic astrophysics, particularly the earliest stages at high-redshift. However, studying SMBHs at high-redshift with cosmological simulations, is challenging due to the large volumes and high-resolution required. Through its innovative simulation strategy, the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations allows us to simulate a much wider range of environments which contain SMBHs with masses extending to $M_{\bullet}&gt;10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ at $z=5$. In this paper, we use FLARES to study the physical properties of SMBHs and their hosts in the early Universe ($5\le\, z \le10$). FLARES predicts a sharply declining density with increasing redshift, decreasing by a factor of 100 over the range $z=5\to 10$. Comparison between our predicted bolometric luminosity function and pre-\emph{JWST} observations yield a good match. However, recent \emph{JWST} observations appear to suggest a larger contribution of SMBHs than previously observed, or predicted by FLARES. Finally, by using a re-simulation with AGN feedback disabled, we explore the impact of AGN feedback on their host galaxies. This reveals that AGN feedback results in a reduction of star formation activity, even at $z&gt;5$, but only in the most massive galaxies. A deeper analysis reveals that AGN are also the cause of suppressed star formation in passive galaxies but that the presence of an AGN doesn't necessarily result in the suppression of star formation.

  The supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6}$$-$$10^{10}~M_\odot$) that power luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs), i.e., quasars, generally show a correlation between thermal disk emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and coronal emission in hard X-rays. In contrast, some "massive" black holes (mBHs; $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5}$$-$$10^{6}~M_\odot$) in low-mass galaxies present curious X-ray properties with coronal radiative output up to 100$\times$ weaker than expected. To examine this issue, we present new and archival 10 GHz Very Large Array observations of a sample of high-accretion-rate (Eddington ratios $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} &gt; 0.1$), mBH-powered AGNs with Chandra X-ray coverage. Empirical correlations previously revealed in samples of radio-quiet, high-Eddington AGNs indicate that the radio$-$X-ray luminosity ratio, $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$, is approximately constant. Through multiwavelength analysis, we instead find that the X-ray-weaker mBHs in our sample tend toward larger values of $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ even though they remain radio-quiet per their optical$-$UV properties. This trend results in a tentative but highly intriguing correlation between $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ and X-ray weakness, which we argue is consistent with a scenario in which X-rays may be preferentially obscured from our line of sight by a "slim" accretion disk. We compare this observation to weak emission-line quasars (AGNs with exceptionally weak broad-line emission and a significant X-ray-weak fraction) and conclude by suggesting that our results may offer a new observational signature for finding high-accretion-rate AGNs.

  JWST is producing high-quality rest-frame optical and UV spectra of faint galaxies at $z&gt;4$ for the first time, challenging models of galaxy and stellar populations. One galaxy recently observed at $z=5.943$, GS9422, has nebular line and UV continuum emission that appears to require a high ionizing photon production efficiency. This has been explained with an exotic stellar initial mass function (IMF), 10-30x more top-heavy than a Salpeter IMF (Cameron et al. 2023). Here we suggest an alternate explanation to this exotic IMF. We use a new flexible neural net emulator for CLOUDY, Cue, to infer the shape of the ionizing spectrum directly from the observed emission line fluxes. By describing the ionizing spectrum with a piece-wise power-law, Cue is agnostic to the source of the ionizing photons. Cue finds that the ionizing radiation from GS9422 can be approximated by a double power law characterized by $\frac{Q_\mathrm{HeII}}{Q_\mathrm{H}} = -1.5$, which can be interpreted as a combination of young, metal-poor stars and a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) with $F_{\nu} \propto \lambda ^ {2}$ in a 65%/35% ratio. This suggests a significantly lower nebular continuum contribution to the observed UV flux (24%) than a top-heavy IMF ($\gtrsim80$%), and hence, necessitates a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) to explain the continuum turnover bluewards of $\sim1400$ Angstrom. While current data cannot rule out either scenario, given the immense impact the proposed top-heavy IMF would have on models of galaxy formation, it is important to propose viable alternative explanations and to further investigate the nature of peculiar high-z nebular emitters.

  Perturber objects interacting with supermassive black hole accretion disks are often invoked to explain observed quasi-periodic behavior in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present global, 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of black holes on inclined orbits colliding with magnetically arrested thick AGN disks using a binary black hole spacetime with mass ratio $0.1$. We do this by implementing an approximate time-dependent binary black hole metric into the GRMHD code Athena++. The secondary enhances the unbound mass outflow rate 2-4 times above that provided by the disk in quasi-periodic outbursts, eventually merging into a more continuous outflow at larger distances. We present a simple analytic model that qualitatively agrees well with this result and can be used to extrapolate to unexplored regions of parameter space. We show self-consistently for the first time that spin-orbit coupling between the primary black hole spin and the binary orbital angular momentum causes the accretion disk and jet directions to precess significantly (by 60$^\circ$-80$^\circ$) on long time-scales (e.g., $\sim$ 20 times the binary orbital period). Because this effect may be the only way for thick AGN disks to consistently precess, it could provide strong evidence of a secondary black hole companion if observed in such a system. Besides this new phenomenology, the time-average properties of the disk and accretion rates onto the primary are only marginally altered by the presence of the secondary, consistent with our estimate for a perturbed thick disk. This situation might drastically change in cooled thin disks.

  Understanding the sources that power nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies is fundamentally important not only for shedding light onto the drivers of reionisation, but to constrain stellar populations and the growth of black holes. Here we focus on an individual object, GS9422, a galaxy at $z_{\rm spec}=5.943$ with exquisite data from the JADES and JEMS surveys, including 14-band JWST/NIRCam photometry and deep NIRSpec prism and grating spectroscopy. We map the continuum emission and nebular emission lines across the galaxy on 0.2-kpc scales. GS9422 has been claimed to have nebular-dominated continuum and an extreme stellar population with top-heavy initial mass function. We find clear evidence for different morphologies in the emission lines, the rest-UV and rest-optical continuum emission, demonstrating that the full continuum cannot be dominated by nebular emission. While multiple models reproduce the spectrum reasonably well, our preferred model with a type-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and local damped Ly-$\alpha$ (DLA) clouds can explain both the spectrum and the wavelength-dependent morphology. The AGN powers the off-planar nebular emission, giving rise to the Balmer jump and the emission lines, including Ly-$\alpha$, which therefore does not suffer DLA absorption. A central, young stellar component dominates the rest-UV emission and -- together with the DLA clouds -- leads to a spectral turn-over. A disc-like, older stellar component explains the flattened morphology in the rest-optical continuum. We conclude that GS9422 is consistent with being a normal galaxy with an obscured, type-2 AGN -- a simple scenario, without the need for exotic stellar populations.
