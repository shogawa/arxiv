  In this manuscript, an improved Seyfert-LINER classification line (= S-L line) is proposed in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, based on a sample of 47,968 low redshift narrow emission line galaxies from SDSS DR16, motivated by different S-L lines reported in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram through different methods. The method proposed by Kewley et al. in 2006 is firstly applied, however, the method cannot lead to an accepted S-L line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Meanwhile, the S-L lines proposed by Schawinski et al. in 2007 and Cid Fernandes et al. in 2010 in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram are different from each other. Therefore, it is meaningful to check which proposed S-L line is better or to determine an improved one in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram by a new method. In this manuscript, Seyferts and LINERs that have already been classified in the [S~{\sc ii}] and/or [O~{\sc i}] BPT diagrams can be visualized in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, leading the intersection boundary of the two contour maps to be considered as the S-L line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Rather than the previously proposed S-L lines, the new S-L line can lead to more efficient and harmonious classifications of Seyferts and LINERs, especially in the composite galaxy region, in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Furthermore, based on the discussed S-L lines, the number ratio of Type-2 Seyferts to Type-2 LINERs differs significantly from that of Type-1 Seyferts to Type-1 LINERs in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, suggesting that about 90$\%$ of Type-2 LINERs are non-AGN-related objects, true Type-2 AGNs, or objects exhibiting both Seyfert and LINER characteristics.

  Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) have now been discovered out to redshift $z=13$, and are valuable probes of the reionization history at redshifts beyond the reach of other currently available tracers. Most inferences of the neutral hydrogen fraction from LAE observations rely on one-point and two-point statistics like the luminosity function and the power spectrum. We present here an analysis of the bispectrum of high-redshift LAEs and demonstrate its sensitivity to the Epoch of Reionization. We use the Sherwood-Relics suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE to generate realistic LAE mock catalogues for a wide range of reionization models, varying the ionization history and the source populations, including contributions of AGN to hydrogen reionization. We demonstrate that the bispectrum provides greater sensitivity than the power spectrum to both the timing and spatial morphology of reionization. Using reduced-$\chi^2$ analysis we further show that the bispectrum also responds more strongly to variations in source population and AGN contribution, apparently more efficiently capturing morphological features missed by two-point statistics. The redshift evolution of the bispectrum reflects the increased clustering of ionizing sources at earlier epochs. The sensitivity of the bispectrum to peculiar velocities underscores the importance of velocity corrections in comparisons to observations. Our findings demonstrate that the LAE bispectrum is a powerful higher-order statistic for probing reionization through current and future LAE surveys using telescopes such as Subaru and JWST.
