  We demonstrate that the properties of eccentric gravitational wave (GW) signals enhance the detectability of GW phase shifts caused by environmental effects (EEs): The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEs can be boosted by up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ with respect to corresponding circular signals, where $\ell_{\rm max}$ is the highest modeled eccentric GW harmonic and $n$ is the frequency scaling of the GW dephasing prescription associated to the EE. We investigate the impact on a population level, adopting plausible eccentricity distributions for binary sources observed by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (A+ and A\# sensitivities), as well as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). For sources in the high eccentricity tail of a distribution ($e \gtrsim 0.2$ at 10 Hz), phase shifts can systematically be up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ times smaller than in a corresponding circular signal and still be detectable. For typical EEs, such as Roemer delays and gas drag, this effect amounts to SNR enhancements that range from $10^2$ up to $10^5$. For CE and ET, our analysis shows that EEs will be an ubiquitous feature in the eccentric tail of merging binaries, regardless of the specific details of the formation channel. Additionally, we find that the joint analysis of eccentricity and phase shift is already plausible in current catalogs if a fraction of binaries merge in AGN migration traps.

  A head-tail galaxy is thought to be a radio galaxy with bent active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets interacting with the intracluster medium (ICM). Study of head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega" structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.

  Stars embedded in the inner pc region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) experience extreme accretion conditions that significantly alter their evolution. We present one-dimensional MESA simulations of stars growing and decaying within AGN disks, implementing radiative-feedback-regulated accretion which limits stellar growth near the Eddington luminosity, as well as wind-driven mass loss. Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded stars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and chemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: ``immortal" stars that indefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and ``metamorphic" stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching the disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their cores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large masses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the ``immortal" track unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in preventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of order-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate. Embedded metamorphic stars significantly enrich AGN disks with helium and $\alpha$-elements, potentially explaining the observed high metallicity in broad-line regions (BLR) without excessive helium enrichment. This study underscores the critical interplay between stellar feedback and accretion physics in shaping the stellar populations and chemical evolution within AGN disks.

  The James Webb Space Telecope (JWST) opened a new window for the study of the highest redshift ($z&gt;7$) Universe. This work presents a theoretical investigation of the very-high redshift Universe using the state-of-the-art GALaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model, run on merger trees from the Planck-Millennium $N$-body simulation. We show that GAEA successfully reproduces a wide range of high-$z$ observational estimates including: the galaxy stellar mass function up to $z\sim13$ and the total (galaxies and AGN) UV luminosity function (LF) up to $z\sim10$. We find that the AGN UV emission represents an important contribution at the bright end of the UVLF up to $z\sim8$, but it is negligible at higher redshift. Our model reproduces well the observed mass-metallicity relation at $z\leq4$, while it slightly overestimates the normalization of the relation at earlier cosmic epochs. At $z\geq11$, current UVLF estimates are at least one order of magnitude larger than model predictions. We investigate the impact of different physical mechanisms, such as an enhanced star formation efficiency coupled with a reduced stellar feedback or a negligible stellar feedback at $z&gt;10$. In the framework of our model, both the galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions at $z\geq10$ can be explained by assuming feedback-free starbursts in high-density molecular clouds. However, we show that this model variant leads to a slight increase of the normalization of the $z\geq10$ mass-metallicity relation, strengthening the tension with available data. A model with negligible stellar feedback at $z&gt;10$ also predicts larger numbers of massive and bright galaxies aligning well with observations, but it also overestimates the metallicity of the interstellar medium. We show that these model variants can in principle be discriminated using the relation between the star formation rate and galaxy stellar mass.   

Only Nitrogen-Enhanced Galaxies Have Detectable UV Nitrogen Emission

  The detections of bright UV nitrogen emission lines in some high-redshift galaxies suggest unexpectedly high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-1.0$) compared to local values ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-1.5$) at similar metallicities ($12+\log(\rm O/H)\lesssim8.0$). Although the presence of these `N-enhanced' galaxies indicates signatures of atypical chemical enrichment processes in the early universe, the prevalence of nitrogen enhancement in high-$z$ galaxies is unclear. So far, only $\sim$10 $z&gt;5$ galaxies have nitrogen abundance measurements, and they all suggest elevated N/O ratios. Do all high-redshift galaxies exhibit elevated N/O ratios, or are we simply missing `N-normal' galaxies whose nitrogen abundances follow the local N/O scaling relation? To tackle these questions, we calculate the detection limits of UV NIII] or NIV] lines in current JWST surveys CEERS and JADES, and compare them to predictions from both `N-enhanced' and `N-normal' AGN narrow-line region and H II region photoionization models. We find that CEERS can only detect galaxies with significant nitrogen enhancement ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-0.4$), while JADES can only detect galaxies with moderately elevated N/O ratios compared to local values ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-1.0$). Even for the deepest exposure in JADES, UV nitrogen lines produced by `N-normal' galaxies at $z&gt;5$ are too faint and thus not detectable, making their nitrogen abundance unmeasurable. Our results suggest that the existing sample of galaxies with measurable nitrogen abundances at $z\gtrsim5$ is incomplete and biased toward galaxies with significantly elevated N/O ratios. Deep ($t_{\rm exp}\sim40-500\,$hours) spectroscopic surveys will be crucial for building a complete sample to study nitrogen enrichment mechanisms in the early universe.   

Broad Iron Line as a Relativistic Reflection from Warm Corona in AGN

  We present that the broad feature usually observed in X-ray spectra can be explained by a ray-traced emission from a two-slab system containing a dissipative, warm corona on top of an accretion disk in an AGN. Such an accretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located above a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and FeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona, can be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity of the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying the SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor. Our results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using high-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code TITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the ray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray spectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the disk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation and external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized iron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the black hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV. For all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron lines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the illuminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona covering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under strong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those originating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total line profile in AGN.

  GHZ2 is among the highest-redshift galaxies discovered to date, exhibiting a spectrum rich with prominent emission lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and optical. These features raise critical questions about the mechanism powering this nebular emission, in particular the extremely strong C IV$\lambda$1548 emission (rest-frame EW $=$ 45 Angstrom). Here we aim to quantify the AGN contribution within this system using the BEAGLE-AGN tool to simultaneously fit the spectrum and photometry of GHZ2. We consider a range of models with and without AGN components, allowing us to disentangle the stellar and AGN contribution of GHZ2 for the first time. We conclude that a partial contribution by an AGN is significantly favored based on the Bayes factor comparison to models without an AGN component, measuring an AGN contribution of 54$^{+1}_{-1}$% and 26$^{+4}_{-2}$% for the C IV$\lambda$1548 and C III]$\lambda$1908 emission lines, respectively. We obtain an estimate for the black hole mass using the accretion luminosity ($L_{acc}$) from the best fit BEAGLE-AGN model, computing a value of log$_{10}$(M$_{BH}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.20$^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, for an Eddington ratio of $\eta$ = 0.5 (with a systematic uncertainty of $\sim$1 dex). The inferred black hole mass to stellar mass ratio is 0.05$^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, consistent with other high redshift AGN systems. If the black hole interpretation is confirmed, GHZ2 would represent the most distant black hole identified to date, making it an ideal laboratory to study AGN growth and their role in shaping high-redshift galactic evolution.

  Using the large statistics provided by both Euclid and the LOFAR surveys, we present the first large-scale study of the connection between radio emission, its morphology, and the merging properties of the hosts of radio sources up to z=2. By dividing the radio sample into active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies, we find that radio-emitting AGN show a clear preference to reside within galaxies undergoing a merging event. This is more significant for AGN that present extended and/or complex radio emission: indeed, about half of them are associated with merging systems, while only 15% are hosted by an isolated galaxy. The observed trend is primarily driven by AGN residing at z &lt; 1, especially in the case of high - P144MHz &gt; 10^24 W Hz-1 sr-1 - radio luminosities (60% in mergers versus 10% isolated regardless of radio appearance). The situation is reversed in the case of radio-emitting star-forming galaxies, which are preferentially associated with isolated systems. This is more significant as we move towards low radio-luminosity/star-formation objects (P144MHz &lt; 10^23 W Hz-1 sr-1) for which we find 40% in isolated systems versus 20% in mergers. These values hold regardless of redshift. We interpret the above result for AGN with their need to accrete outer gas from local encounters in order to trigger (radio) activity, especially in the case of extended radio emission such as hot-spots and lobes. This is mostly observed at z &lt; 1, since in the local Universe galaxies are more gas deprived than their higher-redshift counterparts. Internal gas reservoirs instead seem sufficient to trigger star formation within the majority of galaxies, which indeed prefer to be associated with isolated systems at all redshifts probed.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been observed in dwarf galaxies, yet the impact of black hole feedback in these low-mass systems remains unclear. To uncover the potential effects of AGN in the low-mass galaxy regime, we study the properties and demographics of active dwarf galaxies at $z=0$, using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We use data from the TNG50-1 simulation, selecting central galaxies with stellar masses in the range $8 \leq \log(M_\ast/{\rm M_\odot}) \leq 9.5$, and selecting AGN based on their Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$). We analyzed the properties and environment of AGN host galaxies and compared them with inactive control galaxies. The AGN fractions found in the simulation depend strongly on the threshold for $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in the AGN selection, ranging from $\sim$ 1\% ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \geq 0.05$) to $\sim$ 24\% ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \geq 0.01$). In comparison with non-AGN galaxies of similar stellar and halo mass, dwarf AGN hosts are deficient in neutral gas, having $\sim$ 3.9 times less neutral mass, in qualitative agreement with observations. The dearth in neutral gas is stronger beyond two stellar half-mass radii ($r \gtrsim 3$ kpc), and AGN hosts have more extended gas components than non-AGN galaxies, with a gas half-mass radius, on average, $\gtrsim$ 10 kpc larger. AGN hosts are also slightly less star-forming, but have no differences in local environment. We found that AGN can significantly decrease the neutral gas component of dwarf galaxies, a direct effect of the high-accretion feedback mode employed in IllustrisTNG. However, it is important to test our findings with observations to unveil the complete role of AGN in dwarf galaxies. In TNG50, dwarf AGN fractions are an order of magnitude larger than those observed, motivating a detailed investigation to precisely quantify the mismatch between simulations and observations.   

A dust condensation instability in AGN atmospheres: failed winds and the
  broad line region

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are important drivers of galactic evolution; however, the underlying physical processes governing their properties remain uncertain. In particular, the specific cause for the generation of the broad-line region is unclear. There is a region where the underlying accretion disc atmosphere becomes cool enough for dust condensation. Using models of the disc's vertical structure, accounting for dust condensation and irradiation from the central source, we show that their upper atmospheres become extended, dusty, and radiation-pressure-supported. Due to the density--temperature dependence of dust condensation, this extended atmosphere forms as the dust abundance slowly increases with height, resulting in density and temperature scale heights considerably larger than the gas pressure scale height. We show that such an atmospheric structure is linearly unstable. An increase in the gas density raises the dust sublimation temperature, leading to an increased dust abundance, a higher opacity, and hence a net vertical acceleration. Using localised 2D hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate the existence of our linear instability. In the non-linear state, the disc atmosphere evolves into ``fountains'' of dusty material that are vertically launched by radiation pressure before being exposed to radiation from the central source, which sublimates the dust and shuts off the radiative acceleration. These dust-free clumps then evolve ballistically, continuing upward before falling back towards the disc under gravity. This clumpy ionized region has velocity dispersions $\gtrsim 1000$ km/s. This instability and our simulations are representative of the Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow (FRADO) model proposed for the AGN broad-line region.

  Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is widely viewed as the most promising solution to the long-standing cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters, yet previous models prescribe jet properties inconsistent with accretion physics. We perform high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster using the MACER framework, incorporating both jets and winds constrained by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and observations. The combined feedback reproduces key observables--including cold gas mass, star formation rate, thermodynamic radial profiles, and black hole growth--while jet-only or wind-only models fail. The success arises from turbulence driven by jet-wind shear that enhances kinetic-to-thermal energy conversion, boosting heating efficiency by factors of three and six relative to wind-only and jet-only cases, respectively, yielding a self-consistent solution to cluster cooling flows.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), owing to their great distances and compact sizes, serve as fundamental anchors for defining the celestial reference frame. With about 1.9 million AGNs observed in Gaia DR3 at optical precision comparable to radio wavelengths, Gaia provides a solid foundation for constructing the next-generation, kinematically non-rotating optical reference frame. Accurate assessment of systematic residuals in AGN astrometry is therefore crucial. In this talk, we analysed the parallaxes and proper motions of Gaia DR3 AGNs to characterize systematic errors and their correlations with various physical and observational properties. A subset of Gaia-CRF3 AGNs exhibits significant astrometric offsets, mainly arising from dual or lensed quasars whose structural variations induce photocenter jitter, mimicking parallax and proper motion. Such sources must be carefully excluded from reference frame construction. To this end, we introduce an astrometric quality index for each source to quantify its astrometric reliability. The results reveal a strong correlation between lower quality index values and increasing errors in position, proper motion, and parallax, demonstrating that the proposed index provides an effective metric for selecting high-fidelity AGNs as primary reference sources.

  Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) were recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability traces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical energy to date is $\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass $(&gt;30\, M_\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.

  We present an analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of PJ1053+60, a hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG) at z=3.549 that is strongly lensed by a foreground group at z=0.837. We also present GNIRS spectroscopy confirming the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the southwest of PJ1053+60 ($AGN_{SW}$) at $z_{SW}$ = 1.373 $\pm$ 0.006. Using this redshift prior, we decompose the X-ray spectrum of PJ1053+60 into $AGN_{SW}$ and high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) components from the HyLIRG. The HMXB component has an unusually high luminosity, $\sim$ 50 times higher than calibration derived from local galaxies, and a characteristic photon index likely too flat to be caused by high-mass X-ray binaries at rest frame energies above a few keV. Our 2-D spatial decomposition also suggests a similarly high X-ray HMXB luminosity, although the limited spatial resolution prevents meaningful morphological constraints on the component. We conclude that the enhanced X-ray emission may only be explained by the presence of another AGN ($AGN_{FG}$) embedded in the foreground group lensing the PJ1053+60 system. The presence of $AGN_{FG}$ is further supported by the detection of a point-like radio continuum source that coincides with the brightest group galaxy (BGG) of the foreground lens. Our study demonstrates the limited capability of current X-ray observatories while highlighting the need for higher angular resolution observations to definitively characterize the nature of X-ray emission in distant, strongly lensed HyLIRGs.

  The production sites of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos remain uncertain, though growing evidence suggests a connection to relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present a detailed analysis of the recent PeV neutrino event KM3-230213A reported by the KM3NeT collaboration, aiming to constrain the physical conditions of its source. Assuming proton acceleration at shocks, we derive the properties of the proton distribution and the energetics required to explain the neutrino emission. Using contemporaneous multiwavelength observations of three AGN flaring candidates within the error region, we examine the plausibility of each of them as the possible counterpart. Our results favor PMN J0606-0724, which exhibits a prominent radio flare coincident with the neutrino arrival. In this framework, the red-giant interaction remains the key driver of baryon injection and shock acceleration, while the dominant external photon field sets the neutrino energy scale: photospheric photons from the red giant yield ~1-10 PeV neutrinos, whereas the ~220 PeV event KM3-230213A is more naturally produced through interactions with colder infrared photons from the dusty torus.

  Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars serve as critical probes for understanding active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows, black hole accretion, and cosmic evolution. To address the limitations of manual classification in large-scale spectroscopic surveys - where the number of quasar spectra is growing exponentially - we propose BALNet, a deep learning approach consisting of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to automatically detect BAL troughs in quasar spectra. BALNet enables both the identification of BAL quasars and the measurement of their BAL troughs. We construct a simulated dataset for training and testing by combining non-BAL quasar spectra and BAL troughs, both derived from SDSS DR16 observations. Experimental results in the testing set show that: (1) BAL trough detection achieves 83.0% completeness, 90.7% purity, and an F1-score of 86.7%; (2) BAL quasar classification achieves 90.8% completeness and 94.4% purity; (3) the predicted BAL velocities agree closely with simulated ground truth labels, confirming BALNet's robustness and accuracy. When applied to the SDSS DR16 data within the redshift range 1.5&lt;z&lt;5.7, at least one BAL trough is detected in 20.4% of spectra. Notably, more than a quarter of these are newly identified sources with significant absorption, 8.8% correspond to redshifted systems, and some narrow/weak absorption features were missed. BALNet greatly improves the efficiency of large-scale BAL trough detection and enables more effective scientific analysis of quasar spectra.

  Radio galaxy remnants are a rare subset of the radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGN) population, representing the quiescent phase in the RLAGN lifecycle. Despite their observed scarcity, they offer valuable insights into the AGN duty cycle and feedback processes. Due to the mega-year timescales over which the RLAGN lifecycle takes place, it is impossible to observe the active to remnant transition in real-time. Numerical simulations offer a solution to follow the long-term evolution of RLAGN plasma. In this work, we present the largest suite (to date) of three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations studying the dynamic evolution of the active-to-remnant transition and explore the mechanisms driving cocoon evolution, comparing the results to the expectations of analytic modelling. Our results show key differences between active and remnant sources in both cluster environments and in lower-density group environments. We find that sources in low-density environments can remain overpressured well into the remnant phase. This significantly increases the time for the remnant lobe to transition to a buoyant regime. We compare our results with analytic expectations, showing that the long-term evolution of radio remnants can be well captured for remnants whose expansion is largely pressure-driven if the transition to a coasting phase is assumed to be gradual. We find that remnants of low-powered progenitors can continue to be momentum-driven for about 10 Myr after the jets switch-off. Finally, we consider how the properties of the progenitor influence the mixing of the remnant lobe and confirm the expectation that the remnants of high-powered sources have long-lasting shocks that can continue to heat the surrounding medium.

  The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of more than 500 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles over 140 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.
