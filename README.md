  Aims. We calculate the contribution to the neutrino background from the non-jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) population following the recent IceCube association of TeV neutrinos with NGC 1068. Methods. We exploit our robust knowledge of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and evolution and convert it to the neutrino band by using NGC 1068 as a benchmark and a theoretically motivated neutrino spectrum. Results. The resulting neutrino background up to redshift 5 does not violate either the IceCube diffuse flux or the upper bounds for non-jetted AGN, although barely so. This is consistent with a scenario where the latter class makes a substantial contribution mostly below 1 PeV, while jetted AGN, i.e. blazars, dominate above this energy, in intriguing agreement with the dip in the neutrino data at ~ 300 TeV. More and better IceCube data on Seyfert galaxies will allow us to constrain the fraction of neutrino emitters among non-jetted AGN.

  The extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) represents ionized gases traced by optical/UV lines beyond the stellar extent of galaxies. We herein introduce a novel multi-slit narrow-band spectroscopy method to conduct spatially resolved spectroscopy of the eDIG around a sample of nearby edge-on disk galaxies (eDIG-CHANGES). In this paper, we introduce the project design and major scientific goals, as well as a pilot study of NGC 3556 (M108). The eDIG is detected to a vertical extent of a few kpc above the disk, comparable to the X-ray and radio images. We do not see significant vertical variation of the [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratio. A rough examination of the pressure balance between different circum-galactic medium (CGM) phases indicates the magnetic field is in a rough pressure balance with the X-ray emitting hot gas, and may play an important role in the global motion of both the eDIG and the hot gas in the lower halo. At the location of an HST/COS observed UV bright background AGN $\sim29\rm~kpc$ from the center of NGC 3556, the magnetic pressure is much lower than that of the hot gas and the ionized gas traced by UV absorption lines, although the extrapolation of the pressure profiles may cause some biases in this comparison. By comparing the position-velocity diagrams of the optical and CO lines, we also find the dynamics of the two gas phases are consistent with each other, with no evidence of a global inflow/outflow and a maximum rotation velocity of $\sim150\rm~km~s^{-1}$.

  This review examines the relationship between black hole activity and kinematic gas-star misalignment in brightest group galaxies (BGGs) with different merger rates. The formation history of galaxy groups is assessed through "age-dating" as an indicator of distinct major mergers involving the BGG. BGGs within groups characterized by a higher frequency of major mergers are more likely to host active SMBHs. A consistent correlation is identified between the level of black hole activity, as indicated by the 1.4 GHz and 325 MHz radio emissions, and the degree of kinematic misalignment between the gas and stellar components in BGGs. In dynamically fossil groups, where black hole accretion rate is relatively ($\sim 1$ dex) lower due to the lack of recent ( $\leq 1$ Gyr) major mergers, there is reduced ($\sim$ 30\%) misalignment between the gas and stellar components of BGGs compared to non-fossil groups. Additionally, the study reveals that BGGs in non-fossil groups show higher levels of star formation rate and increased occurrence of mergers, contributing to observed color differences. Exploring the properties and dynamics of the gas disc influenced by mechanical AGN feedback through hydrodynamic simulations suggests that AGN wind-induced effects further lead to persistent gas misalignment of the disk around the supermassive black hole.

  We examine the demographics of radio-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local universe as a function of host galaxy properties, most notably both stellar mass and star formation rate. Radio AGN activity is theoretically implicated in helping reduce star formation rates of galaxies, and therefore it is natural to investigate the relationship between these two galaxy properties. We use a sample of around 10, 000 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), along with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) radio survey and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS). There are 1,126 galaxies in MaNGA with radio detections. Using star formation rate and stellar mass estimates based on Pipe3D, inferred from the high signal-to-noise ratio measurements from MaNGA, we show that star formation rates are strongly correlated with 20 cm radio emission, as expected. We identify as radio AGN those radio emitters that are much stronger than expected from the star formation rate. Using this sample of AGN, the well-measured stellar velocity dispersions from MaNGA, and the black hole M-sigma relationship, we examine the Eddington ratio distribution and its dependence on stellar mass and star formation rate. We find that the Eddington ratio distribution depends strongly on stellar mass, with more massive galaxies having larger Eddington ratios. As found in previous studies, the AGN fraction increases rapidly with stellar mass. We do not find any dependence on star formation rate, specific star formation rate, or velocity dispersion when controlling for stellar mass. We conclude that galaxy star formation rates appear to be unrelated to the presence or absence of a radio AGN, which may be useful in constraining theoretical models of AGN feedback.

  Unraveling the origins of radio emissions from radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGNs) remains a pivotal challenge in astrophysics. One potential source of this radiation is the shock interaction between AGN disk winds and the interstellar medium (ISM). To understand this phenomenon, we construct a spherical, one-zone, and self-similar expansion model of shock structure between ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) and the ISM. We then calculate the energy density distribution of non-thermal electrons by solving the transport equation, considering diffusive shock acceleration as the acceleration mechanism and synchrotron and inverse Compton cooling as the cooling mechanisms. Based on the derived energy distribution of non-thermal electrons, we model the radio synchrotron spectrum of shocked ISM. For the 15 nearby RQ AGNs hosting UFOs, we investigate shocked ISM parameters required to model their observed radio spectra, based on X-ray observations and measured UFO velocities. Radio spectra of 11 out of 15 nearby RQ AGNs would be explained by the AGN disk wind model. This is a compelling indication that shock interactions between AGN disk winds and the ISM could indeed be the source of their radio emissions. The typical predicted source size and magnetic field strength are several $100$ pc and $0.1$ mG, respectively. We also discuss whether our prediction can be tested by future radio observations.

  We present the Granger causality (GC) test for the X-ray reverberation analysis of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). If the light curves in the continuum-dominated band help predict (Granger cause) those dominated by reflection, the Granger lags that associate to the intrinsic reverberation lags can be inferred. We focus on six AGN observed by XMM-Newton, including the sources well-known to exhibit clear X-ray reverberation lags (IRAS 13224-3809 and 1H 0707-495) and those in which reverberation signatures are not well confirmed (MCG-6-30-15, IZW1, Mrk 704 and Mrk 1040). We employ the sliding-window algorithm and estimate the Granger (intrinsic) Fe-L lags along the light curve as the window moves through. This reveals the evolving lags towards the end of some individual observations, suggesting that the corona varies progressively. Occasionally, we observe two clearly separate lags that suggest an extended corona consisting of two zones while producing competing reverberation of two lags. While the GC test is purely hypothetical and might not explain true causality, our conclusion is that the lags are present and could be understood as reverberation lags. Assuming the lags changing solely with the corona, we find that the IRAS 13224-3809 corona varies between $\sim 10$-$25$ $r_{\rm g}$ and sometimes move to $\gtrsim 50$ $r_{\rm g}$. The corona of 1H 0707-495 and MCG-6-30-15 may be analogous to that of IRAS 13224-3809, while in IZw1, Mrk 704 and Mrk 1040 a more compact corona is expected.

  The physical link between AGN activity and the suppression of star formation in their host galaxies is one of the major open questions of AGN feedback. The Spitzer space mission revealed a subset of nearby radio galaxies with unusually bright line emission from warm ($T\ge 100$ K) H$_2$, while typical star-formation tracers were exceptionally faint or undetected. We present JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFU observations of 3C 326 N at z=0.09 and identify 19 ro-vibrational H$_2$ emission lines that probe hot ($T\sim 1000$ K) gas as well as the rotational lines of H$_2$ 0--0 S(3), S(5), and S(6) which probe most of the $2\times 10^9$ M$_\odot$ of warm H$_2$ in this galaxy. CO band heads show a stellar component consistent with a "slow-rotator", typical of a massive $3\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ galaxy, and provide us with a reliable redshift of $z=0.08979\pm 0.0003$. Extended line emission shows a bipolar bubble expanding through the molecular disk at velocities of up to 380 km s$^{-1}$, delineated by several bright clumps along the Northern outer rim, potentially from gas fragmentation. Throughout the disk, the H$_2$ is very broad, FWHM ~100-1300 km s$^{-1}$, and shows dual-component Gaussian line profiles. [FeII]$\lambda$1.644 and Pa$\alpha$ follow the same morphology, however [NeIII]$\lambda$15.56 is more symmetric about the nucleus. We show that the gas, with the exception of [NeIII]$\lambda$15.56, is predominantly heated by shocks driven by the radio jet and that the accompanying line broadening is sufficient to suppress star formation. We also compare the rotational and ro-vibrational lines, finding that the latter can be a good proxy to the global morphology and kinematic properties of the former in strongly turbulent environments. This enables studies of turbulence in galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts while most rotational lines are redshifted out of the MIRI bandpass for $z$&gt;1.5.
