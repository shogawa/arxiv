  Powerful winds at accretion disk scales have been observed in the past 20 years in many AGN, the so called Ultra-Fast Outflows (UFOs). Outflows are intimately related to mass accretion due to the conservation of angular momentum, and therefore are a key ingredient of most accretion disk models around BHs. At the same time, nuclear winds and outflows can provide the feedback which regulates the joint BH and galaxy growth. We reconsider UFO observations in the framework of the Magneto-Hydrodynamic Disk Wind (MHDW) scenario and study their statistical properties. We derive the typical wind-activity history in our sources by assuming that it can be statistically described by population functions. We study the statistical properties of UFOs from the literature and derive the distribution functions of the ratio $\bar \omega$ between the mass outflow and inflow rates, and the ratio $\lambda_w$ between the mass outflow and the Eddington accretion rates. We study the links between $\bar \omega$ and $\lambda_w$ and the Eddington ratio $\lambda={L_{bol}}/{L_{Edd}}$. We find that the distribution functions of $\bar \omega$ and $\lambda_w$ can be described as power laws above some threshold, suggesting that there may be many wind sub-events for each major wind event in each AGN activity cycle, which is a fractal behaviour in agreement with current MHDW and Chaotic Cold Accretion theories. We then introduce a simple cellular automaton to investigate how the dynamical properties of an idealized disk-wind system changes following the introduction of simple feedback rules. We find that without feedback the system is over-critical. Conversely, if feedback is present, the system can be driven toward self organized criticality. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that AGN feedback is a necessary key ingredient in disk-wind systems, and thus, in shaping the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive BHs.

  The IceCube Neutrino Observatory sends realtime neutrino alerts with high probability of being astrophysical in origin. We present a new method to correlate these events and possible candidate sources using $2,089$ blazars from the Fermi-LAT 4LAC-DR2 catalog and with $3,413$ AGNs from the Radio Fundamental Catalog. No statistically significant neutrino emission was found in any of the catalog searches. The result is compatible with a small fraction, $&lt;1$%, of AGNs being neutrino emitters and prior evidence for neutrino emission presented by IceCube and other authors from sources such as TXS 0506+056 and PKS 1502+06. We also present cross-checks to other analyses that claim a significant correlation using similar data samples, and we find that adding more information on the neutrino events and more data overall makes the result compatible with background.

  Molecules and particles make up $\sim 40 - 70\%$ of carbon in the interstellar medium, yet the exact chemical structure of these constituents remains unknown. We present carbon K-shell absorption spectroscopy of the Galactic Interstellar Medium obtained with the Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on the {\it Chandra} Observatory, that directly addresses this question. We probe several lines of sight, using bright AGN as backlighters. We make our measurements differentially with respect to the bright source Mrk 421, in order to take the significant carbon K absorption in the instrument into account. In the spectrum of the blazar 1ES 1553+113 we find evidence for a novel feature: strong extinction on the low-energy side of the neutral C $1s-2p$ resonance, which is indicative of scattering by graphite particles. We find evidence for characteristic particle radii of order $0.1-0.15$ $\mu$m. If this explanation for the feature is correct, limits on the mass of the available carbon along the line of sight may imply that the grains are partially aligned, and the X-rays from the source may have intrinsic polarization.

  We present a search for extremely red, dust-obscured, $z&gt;7$ galaxies with $\textit{JWST}$/NIRCam+MIRI imaging over the first 20 arcmin$^2$ of publicly-available Cycle 1 data from the COSMOS-Web, CEERS, and PRIMER surveys. Based on their red color in F277W$-$F444W ($\sim 2.5$ mag) and detection in MIRI/F770W ($\sim 25$ mag), we identify two galaxies$\unicode{x2014}$COS-z8M1 and CEERS-z7M1$\unicode{x2014}$which have best-fit photometric redshifts of $z=8.5^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ and $z=7.6^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$, respectively. We perform SED fitting with a variety of codes (including BAGPIPES, PROSPECTOR, BEAGLE, and CIGALE), and find a $&gt;95\%$ probability that these indeed lie at $z&gt;7$. Both sources are compact ($R_{\rm eff} \lesssim 200$ pc), highly obscured ($A_V \sim 1.5$$\unicode{x2013}$$2.5$), and, at our best-fit redshift estimates, likely have strong [OIII]+H$\beta$ emission contributing to their $4.4\,\mu$m photometry. We estimate stellar masses of $\sim 10^{10}~M_\odot$ for both sources; by virtue of detection in MIRI at $7.7\,\mu$m, these measurements are robust to the inclusion of bright emission lines, for example, from an AGN. We identify a marginal (2.9$\sigma$) ALMA detection at 2 mm within $0.5''$ of COS-z8M1, which if real, would suggest a remarkably high IR luminosity of $\sim 10^{12} L_\odot$. These two galaxies, if confirmed at $z\sim 8$, would be extreme in their stellar and dust masses, and may be representative of a substantial population of modestly dust-obscured galaxies at cosmic dawn.

  The massive end of the gas-phase mass--metallicity relation (MZR) is a sensitive probe of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback that is a crucial but highly uncertain component of galaxy evolution models. In this paper, we extend the $z\sim0.7$ MZR by $\sim$0.5 dex up to log$(M_\star/\textrm{M}_\odot)\sim11.1$. We use extremely deep VLT VIMOS spectra from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey to measure metallicities for 145 galaxies. The LEGA-C MZR matches the normalization of the $z\sim0.8$ DEEP2 MZR where they overlap, so we combine the two to create an MZR spanning from 9.3 to 11.1 log$(M_\star/\textrm{M}_\odot)$. The LEGA-C+DEEP2 MZR at $z\sim0.7$ is offset to slightly lower metallicities (0.05-0.13 dex) than the $z\sim0$ MZR, but it otherwise mirrors the established power law rise at low/intermediate stellar masses and asymptotic flattening at high stellar masses. We compare the LEGA-C+DEEP2 MZR to the MZR from two cosmological simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA), which predict qualitatively different metallicity trends for high-mass galaxies. This comparison highlights that our extended MZR provides a crucial observational constraint for galaxy evolution models in a mass regime where the MZR is very sensitive to choices about the implementation of AGN feedback.   

Using multiobjective optimization to reconstruct interferometric data

  Imaging in radioastronomy is an ill-posed inverse problem. Particularly the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration faces two big limitations for the existing methods when imaging the active galactic nuclei (AGN): large and expensive surveys solving the problem with different optimization parameters must be done, and only one local minima for each instance is returned. With our novel nonconvex, multiobjective optimization modeling approach, we aim to overcome these limitations. To this end we used a multiobjective version of the genetic algorithm (GA): the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition, or MOEA/D. GA strategies explore the objective function by evolutionary operations to find the different local minima, and to avoid getting trapped in saddle points. First, we have tested our algorithm (MOEA/D) using synthetic data based on the 2017 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array and a possible EHT + next-generation EHT (ngEHT) configuration. We successfully recover a fully evolved Pareto front of non-dominated solutions for these examples. The Pareto front divides into clusters of image morphologies representing the full set of locally optimal solutions. We discuss approaches to find the most natural guess among these solutions and demonstrate its performance on synthetic data. Finally, we apply MOEA/D to observations of the black hole shadow in Messier 87 (M87) with the EHT data in 2017. MOEA/D is very flexible, faster than any other Bayesian method and explores more solutions than Regularized Maximum Likelihood methods (RML). We have done two papers to present this new algorithm: the first explains the basic idea behind multi-objective optimization and MOEA/D and it is used to recover static images, while in the second paper we extend the algorithm to allow dynamic and (static and dynamic) polarimetric reconstructions.   

Confirmation of the standard cosmological model from red massive
  galaxies $\sim600$ Myr after the Big Bang

  In their recent study, Labb\'e et al. used multi-band infrared images captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to discover a population of red massive galaxies that formed approximately 600 million years after the Big Bang. The authors reported an extraordinarily large density of these galaxies, with stellar masses exceeding $10^{10}$ solar masses, which, if confirmed, challenges the standard cosmological model as suggested by recent studies. However, this conclusion is disputed. We contend that during the early epochs of the universe the stellar mass-to-light ratio could not have reached the values reported by Labb\'e et al. A model of galaxy formation based on standard cosmology provides support for this hypothesis, predicting the formation of massive galaxies with higher ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, which produce several hundred solar masses of stars per year and containing significant dust. These forecasts are consistent with the abundance of JWST/HST galaxies selected photometrically in the rest-frame UV wavelengths and with the properties of the recent spectroscopically-confirmed JWST/HST galaxies formed during that era. Discrepancies with Labb\'e et al. may arise from overestimation of the stellar masses, systematic uncertainties, absence of JWST/MIRI data, heavy dust extinction affecting UV luminosities, or misidentification of faint red AGN galaxies at closer redshifts. The current JWST/HST results, combined with a realistic galaxy formation model, provide strong confirmation of the standard cosmology.

  With high-sensitivity kiloparsec-scale radio polarimetry, we can examine the jet-medium interactions and get a better understanding of the blazar divide in radio-loud (RL) AGN. We are analyzing the radio polarimetric observations with the EVLA and GMRT of 24 quasars and BL Lacs belonging to the Palomar-Green (PG) sample. The RL quasars show extensive polarisation structures in their cores, jets, lobes, and hotspots, whereas preliminary results suggest that BL Lacs exhibit polarisation primarily in their cores and inner jet regions. These findings imply that both intrinsic (central engine-related) and extrinsic (environment-related) variables are important in the formation of the blazar subclasses. The Fanaroff-Riley (FR) dichotomy can also be studied assuming RL unification and looking through the lens of blazars. Due to the radio-unbiased nature of the optically/UV-selected PG sample, we find a large fraction of the PG quasars are restarted, distorted (S- or X-shaped), or have a hybrid FR morphology.   

Statistical study of a large and cleaned sample of ultraluminous and

  Ultra-/hyperluminous X-ray sources (ULX/HLX) could be interesting laboratories to further improve our understanding of the supermassive black hole growth through super-Eddington accretion episodes and successive mergers of lighter holes. ULXs are thought to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass compact objects, while HLXs may be accreting intermediate mass black holes (IMBH). However, a significant portion of the sample of ULX/HLX candidates derived from catalogue searches are background AGN. Here we build ULX and HLX samples from recent XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT and Chandra catalogues and the GLADE catalogue of galaxies. We aim to characterise the frequency, environment, hardness and variability of ULXs and HLXs to better assess their differences and understand their populations. After a thorough classification of these X-ray sources, we remove 42% of $S/N&gt;3$ sources shown to be contaminants, to obtain the cleanest sample of ULX/HLX to date. From a sample of 1342 ULXs and 191 HLXs, we study the occupation fraction, hardness, variability, radial distribution and preferred environment of the sources. We build their Malmquist-corrected X-ray luminosity functions (XLF) and compare them with previous studies. We statistically compare ULXs and HLXs and assess the differences in their nature. The interpretation of HLXs as IMBHs is investigated. A significant break is seen in the XLF at $\sim 10^{40}$ erg/s. Our ULX sample, having $\leq 2$% of contaminants, confirms that ULXs are located preferentially in spiral galaxies and galaxies with higher star-formation rates. Unlike ULXs, HLXs seem to reside equally in spiral and lenticular/elliptical galaxies. 35% of the HLX candidates have an optical counterpart, and we estimate the mass of 120 of them in the range of $2000-10^5 M_\odot$. Most HLXs are consistent with an accreting massive black hole in a dwarf galaxy satellite.

  We explore the potential of the ongoing Zwicky-Transient-Facility (ZTF) survey for studying Intra-Night Optical Variability (INOV) of active galactic nuclei (AGN), in particular for picking rare events of large INOV amplitudes, whose detection may require extensive temporal coverage. For this, we have used the available high cadence subsets of the ZTF database to build a well-defined large sample of 53 blazars (BLs) and another sample of 132 radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), matched to the blazar sample in the redshift-magnitude plane. High-cadence ZTF monitoring of these two matched samples are available, respectively, for 156 and 418 intranight sessions. Median durations for both sets of sessions are 3.7 hours. The two classes of powerful AGN monitored in these sessions represent opposite extremes of jet activity. The present analysis of their ZTF light curves has revealed some strong INOV events which, although not exceptionally rare for blazars, are indeed so for RQQs, and their possible nature is briefly discussed.
