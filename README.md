  We study the thermal stability of non-self-gravitating turbulent $\alpha$ discs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to test a new type of high-amplitude active galactic nuclei (AGN) flares. On calculating discs structures, we compute the critical points of stability curves for discs around SMBH, which cover a wide range of accretion rates and resemble the shape of a $\xi$ curve. We find that there are values of the disc parameters that favour the transition of a disc ring from a recombined cool state to a hot, fully ionised, advection dominated, geometrically thick state with higher viscosity parameter $\alpha$. For SMBH with masses $\sim 10^6-10^8 M_\odot$, such a flare can occur in the geometrically thin and optically thick neutral disc with convective energy transfer through the disc thickness surrounding a radiatively inefficient accretion flow. When self-gravity effects are negligible, the duration of a flare and the associated mass exhibit a positive correlation with the truncation radius of the geometrically thin disc prior to the flare. According to our rough estimates, $\sim 4-3000 M_\odot$ can be involved in a giant flare, i.e. can be accreted or entrained with an outflow lasting 1 to 400 years, if the flare is triggered somewhere between $60$ and $600$ gravitational radii in a disc around SMBH with $10^7 M_\odot$. The accretion rate on SMBH peaks at a super-Eddington value about ten times faster. The peak effective disc temperature at the trigger radius is $\sim 10^5\,$K, but it can be obscured by an optically thick outflow that reprocesses the emission to longer wavelengths. Such a transfer of disc state could trigger a massive outburst, similar to that following a tidal disruption event.

  Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence can drive significant temperature fluctuations in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). As a result, the disk can be highly inhomogeneous and has a half-light radius larger than the static Shakura \&amp; Sunyaev Disk (SSD), in agreement with quasar microlensing observations. Meanwhile, the accretion-disk sizes can also be determined using continuum reverberation mappings which measure interband cross correlations and time lags. The interband time lags are often understood in the X-ray reprocessing scenario. Here we show that the interband continuum time lags of the X-ray reprocessing of an inhomogeneous disk are similar to or even smaller than those of a static SSD. Consequently, the X-ray reprocessing of an inhomogeneous disk cannot account for the recent continuum reverberation mappings of some Seyfert 1 AGNs, whose measured time lags are larger than those of a static SSD. In contrast to the tight correlation between UV/optical variations, the cross correlation between X-ray and disk emission is rather weak in this model; this behavior is consistent with recent continuum reverberation mappings. Moreover, the time lags in this model are anti-correlated with the amplitude of disk temperature fluctuations. Our results suggest that the temperature fluctuations should be properly considered when modeling interband continuum time lags.

  Using the equations of motion from Hill's problem, with added accelerations for different forms of dynamical friction, we provide the (to-date) broadest scale-free study of friction-driven binary formation in gaseous disks and stellar clusters. We focus mainly on binary formation between stellar-mass black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNi), considering both gas dynamical friction from AGN disks and stellar dynamical friction from the nuclear star cluster. We first find simple, dimensionless friction coefficients that approximate the effects of standard models for gas and stellar dynamical friction. We perform extensive simulations of Hill's problem under such friction, and we present a picture of binary formation through encounters between single stars on nearby orbits, as a function of friction parameter, eccentricity, and inclination. Notably, we find that the local binary formation rate is a linear function of the friction coefficient so long as the friction is weak. Due to the dimensionless nature of our model problem, our findings are generalizable to binary formation at all scales (e.g., intermediate-mass black holes in a star cluster, planetesimals in a gaseous disk).   

Observational Tests of Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback: An Overview of
  Approaches and Interpretation

  Growing supermassive black holes (Active Galactic Nuclei; AGN) release energy with the potential to alter their host galaxies and larger-scale environment; a process named "AGN feedback". Feedback is a required component of galaxy formation models and simulations to explain observed properties of galaxy populations. We provide a broad overview of observational approaches that are designed to establish the physical processes that couple AGN energy to the multi-phase gas, or to find evidence that AGN impact upon galaxy evolution. The orders-of-magnitude range in spatial, temporal, and temperature scales, requires a diverse set of observational studies. For example, studying individual targets in detail sheds light on coupling mechanisms; however, evidence for long-term impact of AGN is better established within galaxy populations that are not necessarily currently active. We emphasise how modern surveys have revealed the importance of radio emission for identifying, and characterising, feedback mechanisms. At the achieved sensitivities, the detected radio emission can trace a range of processes, including shocked interstellar medium caused by AGN outflows (driven by various mechanisms including radiation pressure, accretion disc winds, and jets). We also describe how interpreting observations in the context of theoretical work can be challenging, in part, due to some of the adopted terminology.
