  Extragalactic radio continuum surveys play an increasingly more important role in galaxy evolution and cosmology studies. While radio galaxies and radio quasars dominate at the bright end, star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are more common at fainter flux densities. Our aim is to develop a machine learning classifier that can efficiently and reliably separate AGNs and SFGs in radio continuum surveys. We perform supervised classification of SFGs vs AGNs using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) on three LOFAR Deep Fields (Lockman Hole, Bootes and ELAIS-N1), which benefit from a wide range of high-quality multi-wavelength data and classification labels derived from extensive spectral energy distribution (SED) analyses. Our trained model has a precision of 0.92(0.01) and a recall of 0.87(0.02) for SFGs. For AGNs, the model has slightly worse performance, with a precision of 0.87(0.02) and recall of 0.78(0.02). These results demonstrate that our trained model can successfully reproduce the classification labels derived from detailed SED analysis. The model performance decreases towards higher redshifts, mainly due to smaller training sample sizes. To make the classifier more adaptable to other radio galaxy surveys, we also investigate how our classifier performs with a poorer multi-wavelength sampling of the SED. In particular, we find that the far-infrared (FIR) and radio bands are of great importance. We also find that higher S/N in some photometric bands leads to a significant boost in the model's performance. In addition to using the 150 MHz radio data, our model can also be used with 1.4 GHz radio data. Converting 1.4 GHz to 150 MHz radio data reduces performance by about 4% in precision and 3% in recall. The final trained model is publicly available at https://github.com/Jesper-Karsten/MBASC

  Recent studies have proposed that the nuclear millimeter continuum emission observed in nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) could be created by the same population of electrons that gives rise to the X-ray emission that is ubiquitously observed in accreting black holes. We present the results of a dedicated high spatial resolution ($\sim$60-100 milliarcsecond) ALMA campaign on a volume-limited ($&lt;50$ Mpc) sample of 26 hard X-ray ($&gt;10$ keV) selected radio-quiet AGN. We find an extremely high detection rate (25/26 or $94^{+3}_{-6}\%$), which shows that nuclear emission at mm-wavelenghts is nearly ubiquitous in accreting SMBHs. Our high-resolution observations show a tight correlation between the nuclear (1-23 pc) 100GHz and the intrinsic X-ray emission (1$\sigma$ scatter of $0.22$ dex). The ratio between the 100GHz continuum and the X-ray emission does not show any correlation with column density, black hole mass, Eddington ratio or star formation rate, which suggests that the 100GHz emission can be used as a proxy of SMBH accretion over a very broad range of these parameters. The strong correlation between 100GHz and X-ray emission in radio-quiet AGN could be used to estimate the column density based on the ratio between the observed 2-10keV ($F^{\rm obs}_{2-10\rm\,keV}$) and 100GHz ($F_{100\rm\,GHz}$) fluxes. Specifically, a ratio $\log (F^{\rm obs}_{2-10\rm\,keV}/F_{100\rm\,GHz})\leq 3.5$ strongly suggests that a source is heavily obscured [$\log (N_{\rm H}/\rm cm^{-2})\gtrsim 23.8$]. Our work shows the potential of ALMA continuum observations to detect heavily obscured AGN (up to an optical depth of one at 100GHz, i.e. $N_{\rm H}\simeq 10^{27}\rm\,cm^{-2}$), and to identify binary SMBHs with separations $&lt;100$ pc, which cannot be probed by current X-ray facilities.
