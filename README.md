  We investigate the influence of large-scale cosmic web environments on galaxy quenching using a volume-limited, stellar mass-matched galaxy sample from SDSS DR18. Galaxies are classified as residing in sheets, filaments, or clusters based on the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor derived from the smoothed density field. The quenched fraction increases with stellar mass and is highest in clusters, intermediate in filaments, and lowest in sheets, reflecting the increasing efficiency of environmental quenching with density. A flattening of the quenched fraction beyond $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 10.6$ across all environments signals a transition from environment-driven to mass-driven quenching. In contrast, the bulge fraction continues to rise beyond this threshold, indicating a decoupling between star formation suppression and morphological transformation. At the high-mass end ($\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.5$), both quenched and bulge fractions bifurcate, increasing in clusters but declining in sheets, suggesting a divergent evolutionary pathway where massive galaxies in sheets retain cold gas and disk-like morphologies, potentially sustaining or rejuvenating star formation. The AGN fraction also increases with stellar mass and is somewhat higher in sheets than in clusters, indicating enhanced AGN activity in low-density, gas-rich environments. The high-mass trends are independently corroborated by our analysis of specific star formation rate, $(u-r)$ colour, concentration index, and D4000 in the stellar mass-density plane, which show that massive galaxies in sheets remain bluer, younger, more star-forming, and structurally less evolved than their cluster counterparts. Our results highlight the cosmic web as an active driver of galaxy evolution.

  Galaxy interactions can disturb gas in galactic discs, compress it, excite it, and enhance star formation. An intriguing system likely consisting of two interacting galaxies overlapping on the line-of-sight was previously studied through ionised gas observations from the integral-field spectrograph Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA). A decomposition into two components using MaNGA spectra, together with a multi-wavelength study, allowed to characterise the system as a minor-merger with interaction-induced star-formation, and maybe AGN activity. We use new interferometric observations of the CO(1-0) gas of this system from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to confront and combine the spatially-resolved ionised and molecular gas observations. Mock NOEMA and MaNGA data are computed from simulated systems of two discs and compared to the observations. The NOEMA observations of the molecular gas, dynamically colder than the ionised gas, help to precise the configuration of the system, which we revisit as being a major merger. Combination of ionised and molecular gas data allow us to study the star-formation efficiency of the system.

  Fermi-type shear particle acceleration is a promising mechanism for sustaining ultra-relativistic particles along the kilo-parsec scale jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). We explore the possibility of synchrotron-limited electron acceleration in mildly relativistic shearing flows and present numerical solutions to the corresponding particle transport equation. We compare our findings with analytical calculations to infer an effective electron cutoff energy, and discuss the relationship to a simplified box model treatment. The results show that mildly relativistic large-scale jets offer a suitable environment for distributed electron acceleration beyond Lorentz factors of $\gamma_e \sim 10^8$.

  The astrophysical sources responsible for the production of high energy neutrinos remain largely uncertain. The strongest associations suggest a correlation between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, it is still unclear which specific regions and mechanisms of the accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH) are responsible for their production. In this paper we investigate the correlation between the positions of IceCat-1 neutrino events and a large, optically selected QSO catalog extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Within this sample, we distinguish radio-quiet QSOs from flat-spectrum radio QSOs (FSRQs)based on radio emission data from the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey (CLASS) catalog. While the associations between neutrino events and radio-quiet QSOs are consistent with being all random matches, FSRQs exhibit a moderately significant correlation (2.7 sigma) with neutrino positions. Additionally we observe that the distribution of minimum distances between neutrino events and FSRQs differs significantly for events at declinations above and below 20 deg. In particular, using the KS test, we find that the high-declination event distribution shows a strong deviation (4 sigma) from a random distribution. We interpret all these results as an indication that a large fraction (&gt; 60%) of the neutrino events observed by IceCube could be produced by the FSRQ and that the emission mechanism is likely related to the relativistic jets rather than the "radio-quiet" (RQ) component of these sources, such as the accretion disk or corona.

  Over the past few years \textit{JWST} has been a major workhorse in detecting and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium. In this work, we present new deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z11-1, a galaxy at z = 11.28, in which we report the detection of multiple rest-frame UV and optical emission lines: CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,09, CIV]$\lambda\lambda$1548,51, [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,29, [NeIII]$\lambda$3869, H$\gamma$ and tentative evidence for HeII$\lambda$1640. The ionisation properties of GS-z11-1 are consistent with star formation, with potential contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate a galaxy stellar mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.8$\pm$0.2 and log(SFR/(M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$))= 0.32$\pm$0.11 for the fiducial SF-only models. We measured C/O from the SED modelling of C/O = 1.20$\pm0.15 \times$ solar. This is one of the highest C/O abundances at z$&gt;$10, and it is consistent with either PopII and PopIII enrichment paths. Despite this source being extremely compact, with a half-light radius of 73$\pm$10 pc, we see no increased equivalent width of NIV] and NIII] emission lines as seen in some other compact sources at similar redshifts, a potential signature of second-generation stars in GCs. Overall, this galaxy exhibits low metallicity and high ionisation parameter consistent with intense star-formation or AGN activity in the early Universe, possibly observed before the enrichment by the second generation of stars in proto-globular clusters in the core of the galaxy.
