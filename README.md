  Seyfert galaxy NGC 5252 harbors enormously extended ionization cones, which have been previously detected in the optical and X-ray band, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the interaction between the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) and the surrounding gas in the AGN host galaxy. We present deep Chandra imaging spectroscopy of NGC 5252 with a total exposure time of 230 ks. The morphology in the soft X-rays shows resolved extended structure from nucleus to a large radial distance, and for the first time we detect the outermost X-ray arc at $\sim$20 kpc. The X-ray cone mostly follows the direction of the optical ionization cones in the southeast and northwest direction, about 20 degrees misaligned with the major axis of the galactic disk of NGC 5252. Fitting the spectra extracted from radial sectors with photoionization models supports that extended emission is mainly photoionized by the central AGN. We also examine the variation of the photoionization parameter along the radial extension, and infer a decreasing ionizing continuum of the central engine by a factor of $\sim$50 over the past 64000 years. These findings are consistent with previous suggestion that NGC 5252 resembles a quasar relic with a $M\sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole, which went through a minor merger event and switched to a low accretion rate state.

  We study little red dots (LRD) detected by JADES and covered by the SMILES MIRI survey. Our sample contains 31 sources, $\sim70$% detected in the two bluest MIRI bands, 40% in redder filters. The median/quartiles redshifts are $z=6.9_{5.9}^{7.7}$ (55% spectroscopic). We analyze the rest-frame ultraviolet through near/mid-infrared spectral energy distributions of LRDs combining NIRCam and MIRI observations, using a variety of modeling techniques that include emission from stars, dust, and (un)obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). The NIRCam$-$MIRI colors, for $\geq10$ $\mu$m, are bluer than direct pure emission from AGN tori; the spectral slope flattens in the rest-frame near-infrared, consistent with a 1.6 $\mu$m stellar bump. Both observations imply that stellar emission makes the dominant contribution at these wavelengths, expediting a stellar mass estimation: the median/quartiles are $\log \mathrm{M_\star/M_\odot}=9.4_{9.1}^{9.7}$. The number density of LRDs is $10^{-4.0\pm0.1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, accounting for $14\pm3$% of the global population of galaxies with similar redshifts and masses. The flat ultraviolet spectral range is dominated by young stars. The rest-frame near/mid-infrared (2-4 $\mu$m) spectral slope reveals significant amounts of dust (bolometric stellar attenuation $\sim3-4$ mag) heated by strong radiation fields arising from highly embedded compact sources. Our models imply $&lt;0.4$ kpc heating knots, containing dust-enshrouded OB stars or an AGN producing a similar radiation field, obscured by $\mathrm{A(V)}&gt;10$ mag. We conclude that LRDs are extremely intense and compact starburst galaxies with mass-weighted ages 5-10 Myr, very efficient in producing dust, their global energy output dominated by the direct and dust-recycled emission from OB stars, with some contribution from obscured AGN in the mid-infrared.

  The properties of warm-hot gas around $\sim L_{*}$ galaxies can be studied with absorption lines from highly ionized metals. We predict Ne VIII column densities from cosmological zoom-in simulations of halos with masses in $\sim 10^{12}$ and $\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ from the FIRE project. Ne VIII traces the volume-filling, virial-temperature gas in $\sim 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos. In $\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos the Ne VIII gas is clumpier, and biased towards the cooler part of the warm-hot phase. We compare the simulations to observations by the CASBaH and CUBS surveys. We show that when inferring halo masses from stellar masses to compare simulated and observed halos, it is important to account for the scatter in the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation, especially at $\,\mathrm{M}_{\star} \gtrsim 10^{10.5} \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Median Ne VIII columns in the fiducial FIRE-2 model are about as high as observed upper limits allow, while the simulations analyzed do not reproduce the highest observed columns. This suggests that the median Ne VIII profiles predicted by the simulations are consistent with observations, but that the simulations may underpredict the scatter. We find similar agreement with analytical models that assume a product of the halo gas fraction and metallicity (relative to solar) $\sim 0.1$-$0.3$, indicating that observations are consistent with plausible CGM temperatures, metallicities, and gas masses. Variants of the FIRE simulations with a modified supernova feedback model and/or AGN feedback included (as well as some other cosmological simulations from the literature) more systematically underpredict Ne VIII columns. The circumgalactic Ne VIII observations therefore provide valuable constraints on simulations that otherwise predict realistic galaxy properties.

  We use new 144 MHz observations over 5634 deg$^2$ from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) to compile the largest sample of uniformly-selected, spectroscopically-confirmed quasars from the 14th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR14). Using the classical definition of radio-loudness, $R=\log(L_{\rm{1.4GHz}}/L_{i})$, we identify 3,697 radio-loud (RL) and 111,132 radio-quiet (RQ) sources at $0.6&lt;z&lt;3.4$. To study their properties, we develop a new rest-frame spectral stacking algorithm, designed with forthcoming massively-multiplexed spectroscopic surveys in mind, and use it to create high signal-to-noise composite spectra of each class, matched in redshift and absolute $i$-band magnitude. We show that RL quasars have redder continuum and enhanced [OII] emission than their RQ counterparts. These results persist when additionally matching in black hole mass, suggesting that this parameter is not the defining factor in making a QSO radio-loud. We find that these features are not gradually varying as a function of radio-loudness but are maintained even when probing deeper into the RQ population, indicating that a clear-cut division in radio-loudness is not apparent. Upon examining the star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from the [OII] emission line, with the contribution from AGN removed using the [NeV] line, we find that RL quasars have a significant excess of star-formation relative to RQ quasars out to $z=1.9$ at least. Given our findings, we suggest that radio-loud sources either preferably reside in gas-rich systems with rapidly-spinning black holes, or represent an earlier obscured phase of QSO evolution.

  Recent years have seen broad observational support for the presence of a clumpy component within the circumnuclear gas around SMBHs. In the X-ray band, individual clouds can manifest themselves when they transit the line of sight to the X-ray corona, temporarily obscuring the X-ray continuum and thereby indicating the characteristics and location of these clouds. X-ray flux monitoring with SRG/eROSITA has revealed that in the Seyfert 1 AGN EC 04570-5206, the soft X-ray flux dipped abruptly for about 10-18 months over 2020-2021, only to recover and then drop a second time by early 2022. Here, we investigate whether these flux dips and recoveries could be associated with cloud occultation events. We complemented the eROSITA scans with multiwavelength follow-up observations, including X-ray/UV observations with Swift, XMM-Newton, and NICER, along with ground-based optical photometric and spectroscopic observations to investigate the spectral and flux variability. XMM-Newton spectra confirm that the soft X-ray flux dips were caused by partial-covering obscuration by two separate clouds. The 2020-2021 event was caused by a cloud with column density near 1e22 /cm2 and a covering fraction near 0.6. The cloud in the 2022 event had a column density near 3e23 /cm2 and a covering fraction near 0.8. The optical/UV continuum flux varied minimally and the optical emission line spectra showed no variability in Balmer profiles or intensity. The transiting gas clouds are neutral or lowly-ionized, while the lower limits on their radial distances are commensurate with the dust sublimation zone (cloud 1) or the optical broad line region (cloud 2). One possible explanation is a dust-free, outflowing wind with embedded X-ray clumps. These events are the first cloud obscuration events detected in a Seyfert galaxy using eROSITA's X-ray monitoring capabilities.   

Metal-poor star formation at $z&gt;6$ with JWST: new insight into hard

  Nearly a decade ago, we began to see indications that reionization-era galaxies power hard radiation fields rarely seen at lower redshift. Most striking were detections of nebular CIV emission in what appeared to be typical low mass galaxies, requiring an ample supply of 48 eV photons to triply ionize carbon. The nature of this population has long remained unclear owing to limitations of ground-based spectroscopy. We have obtained deep JWST/NIRSpec R=1000 spectroscopy of the two z&gt;6 CIV-emitting galaxies known prior to JWST. Here we present a rest-UV to optical spectrum of one of these two systems, the multiply-imaged z=6.1 lensed galaxy RXCJ2248-ID. NIRCam imaging reveals two compact (&lt;22pc) clumps separated by 220pc, with one comprising a dense concentration of massive stars ($&gt;10,400M_{\odot}$/yr/kpc$^2$) formed in a recent burst. We stack spectra of 3 images of the galaxy (J=24.8-25.9), yielding a very deep spectrum providing a high S/N template of strong emission line sources at z&gt;6. The spectrum reveals narrow high ionization lines (HeII, CIV, NIV]) with line ratios consistent with powering by massive stars. The rest-optical spectrum is dominated by very strong emission lines ([OIII] EW=2798\AA), albeit with weak emission from low-ionization transitions ([OIII]/[OII]=184). The electron density is found to be very high($6.4-31\times10^4$cm$^{-3}$) based on three UV transitions. The ionized gas is metal poor ($12+\log(\rm O/H)=7.43^{+0.17}_{-0.09}$), yet highly enriched in nitrogen ($\log(\rm N/O)=-0.39^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$). The spectrum appears broadly similar to that of GNz11 at z=10.6, without showing the same AGN signatures. We suggest that the hard radiation field and rapid nitrogen enrichment may be a short-lived phase that many z&gt;6 galaxies go through as they undergo strong bursts of star formation. We comment on the potential link of such spectra to globular cluster formation.   

Comparative analysis of the SFR of AGN and non-AGN galaxies, as a

  This study involves a comparative analysis of the SFRs of AGN and non-AGN galaxies and of the SFRs of type 1 and 2 AGN. To carry out this investigation, we assembled a dataset consisting of 2\,677 X-ray AGN detected by the XMM-Newton observatory and a control sample of 64\,556 galaxies devoid of AGN. We generated SEDs for these objects using photometric data from the DES, VHS, and AllWISE surveys, and we harnessed the CIGALE code to extract measurements for the (host) galaxy properties. Our dataset encompasses sources spanning a range from $\rm 9.5&lt;\log\,[M_*(M_\odot)]&lt;12.0$, $\rm 42&lt;\log\,[L_{X,2-10keV}(ergs^{-1})]&lt;45.5$, and $\rm 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.5$. To compare SFRs, we calculated the SFR$_{norm}$ parameter. Our analysis revealed that AGN tend to exhibit elevated SFRs compared to non-AGN galaxies, particularly beyond a certain threshold in L$_X$. Notably, this threshold increases as we move towards more massive galaxies. Additionally, for AGN systems with the same L$_X$, the magnitude of the SFR$_{norm}$ decreases as we consider more massive galaxies. This suggests that in galaxies with AGN, the increase in SFR as a function of M$_*$ is not as prominent as in galaxies without AGN. This interpretation finds support in the shallower slope we identify in the X-ray star-forming MS in contrast to the galaxy MS. Employing CIGALE's measurements, we classified AGN into type 1 and type 2. In our investigation, we focused on a subset of 652 type 1 AGN and 293 type 2 AGN with $\rm 10.5&lt;\log,[M_(M_\odot)]&lt;11.5$. Based on our results, type 1 AGN display higher SFRs than type 2 AGN, at redshifts below $\rm z&lt;1$. However, at higher redshifts, the SFRs of the two AGN populations tend to be similar. At redshifts $\rm z&lt;1$, type 1 AGN show augmented SFRs in comparison to non-AGN galaxies. In contrast, type 2 AGN exhibit lower SFRs when compared to galaxies that do not host an AGN.

  Odd radio circles (ORCs) are newly discovered extragalactic radio objects with unknown origin. In this work, we carry out three-dimensional cosmic-ray (CR) magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code and predict the radio morphology of end-on active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet-inflated bubbles considering hadronic emission. We find that powerful and long-duration CR proton (CRp)-dominated jets can create bubbles with similar sizes ($\sim 300-600$ kpc) and radio morphology (circular and edge-brightened) to the observed ORCs in low-mass ($M_{\rm vir}\sim 8\times 10^{12} - 8\times 10^{13}~M_\odot$) halos. Given the same amount of input jet energy, longer-duration (thus lower-power) jets tend to create larger bubbles since high-power jets generate strong shocks that carry away a significant portion of the jet energy. The edge-brightened feature of the observed ORCs is naturally reproduced due to efficient hadronic collisions at the interface between the bubbles and the ambient medium. We further discuss the radio luminosity, X-ray detectability, and the possible origin of such strong AGN jets in the context of galaxy evolution. We conclude that end-on CR-dominated AGN bubbles could be a plausible scenario for the formation of ORCs.

  Galaxy mergers induce the accretion of gas and dust toward the central region of the galaxy, leading to subsequent activities of star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These processes serve as energy sources for the infrared emission in ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Recently, a selected number of ULIRGs were reported to display extended radio continuum emission on a scale of $\sim100$\,kpc related to AGNs, whose properties and role in merging systems still need to be better understood. This paper presents the results of multifrequency observations of the nearby ULIRG IRAS\,01004$-$2237, exhibiting 100-kpc scale continuum emission at radio wavelengths, conducted by the Very Long Baseline Array at 2.3 and 8.4\,GHz. The absence of extended X-ray emission in IRAS\,0100$-$2237 suggested an AGN origin for the radio emission, but further evidence was needed. At 8.4\,GHz, we detect compact radio continuum emission with a brightness temperature exceeding $10^{7.2}$\,K in the nuclear region of the object. Conversely, no significant emission is observed at 2.3\,GHz, indicating its flat or inverted spectrum. Both synchrotron self-absorption and free-free absorption can explain the spectral feature of the source. Given the suggestion of AGN presence at other wavelengths, this emission is a plausible candidate for the AGN core powering the extended radio emission.

  Due to their almost featureless optical/UV spectra, it is challenging to measure the redshifts of BL Lacs. As a result, about 50% of gamma-ray BL Lacs lack a firm measurement of this property, which is fundamental for population studies, indirect estimates of the EBL, and fundamental physics probes. This paper is the third in a series of papers aimed at determining the redshift of a sample of blazars selected as prime targets for future observations with the next generation, ground-based VHE gamma-ray astronomy observatory, Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). The accurate determination of the redshift of these objects is an important aid in source selection and planning of future CTAO observations. The selected targets were expected to be detectable with CTAO in observations of 30 hours or less. We performed deep spectroscopic observations of 41 of these blazars using the Keck II, Lick, SALT, GTC, and ESO/VLT telescopes. We carefully searched for spectral lines in the spectra and whenever features of the host galaxy were detected, we attempted to model the properties of the host galaxy. The magnitudes of the targets at the time of the observations were also compared to their long-term light curves. Spectra from 24 objects display spectral features or a high S/N. From these, 12 spectroscopic redshifts were determined, ranging from 0.2223 to 0.7018. Furthermore, 1 tentative redshift (0.6622) and 2 redshift lower limits at z &gt; 0.6185 and z &gt; 0.6347 were obtained. The other 9 BL Lacs showed featureless spectra, despite the high S/N (&gt; 100) observations. Our comparisons with long-term optical light curves tentatively suggest that redshift measurements are more straightforward during an optical low state of the AGN. Overall, we have determined 37 redshifts and 6 spectroscopic lower limits as part of our programme thus far.

  Recent calculations indicate that radio emission from quasars at $z \sim$ 6 - 7 could be detected at much earlier stages of evolution, at $z \sim$ 14 - 15, by the Next-Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). However, the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} has now discovered less luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at $z &gt;$ 4 and a few massive black holes (BHs) at $z &gt;$ 10, which may be the progenitors of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) but at different stages of growth. Radio detections of these new AGNs would provide complementary measures of their properties and those of their host galaxies. Here we estimate radio flux densities for 19 new AGNs found by the JADES, CEERS and UNCOVER surveys. We find that ngVLA should be able to detect most of these sources in targeted surveys with integration times of 10 - 100 hr (and in just 1 hr for a few of them) but most would require at least 100 hr of SKA time in spite of its greater sensitivities at low frequencies. In some cases, radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that of H II regions and supernovae in their host galaxies, which could be used to estimate their star formation rates. Such detections would be yet another example of the useful synergies between near infrared and radio telescopes in SMBH science in the coming decade.

  The X-ray properties of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) depend on their underlying physical parameters, particularly the accretion rate. We identified eight reverberation-mapped AGNs with some of the largest known accretion rates without high-quality X-ray data. We obtained new Chandra ACIS-S X-ray observations and nearly simultaneous optical spectrophotometry to investigate the properties of these AGNs with extreme super-Eddington accreting black holes (SEAMBHs). We combined our new X-ray measurements with those of other reverberation-mapped AGNs, which have the best-determined masses and accretion rates. The trend of the steepening of the spectral slope between X-ray and optical-UV, $\alpha_{\rm ox}$, with increasing optical-UV luminosity, $L_{2500\r{A}}$, holds true for even the most extreme SEAMBHs. One of our new SEAMBHs appears X-ray weak for its luminosity, perhaps due to absorption associated with orientation effects involving a slim disk thought to be present in highly accreting systems. The correlation of the $\rm 2-8~ keV$ X-ray photon index with the accretion rate also holds for the extreme SEAMBHs, which show some of the largest photon indices reported for AGNs.

  The morphology of a galaxy is a manifestation of the complex interplay of physical processes occurring within and around it, and therefore offers indirect clues to its formation and evolution. We use both visual classification and computer vision to verify the suspected connection between galaxy merging activity - as evidenced by a close/merging galaxy pair, or tidal features surrounding an apparently singular system - and AGN activity. This study makes use of JADES JWST/NIRCam imagery, along with an unprecedentedly complete sample of AGN built using JWST/MIRI photometry in the same field. This 0.9-25 micron dataset enables constraints on the host galaxy morphologies of the broadest possible range of AGN beyond z~1, including heavily obscured examples missing from previous studies. We consider two AGN samples, one consisting of lightly to highly obscured X-ray-selected AGN (Lyu et al. 2022), and the other, presumed Compton-thick mid-infrared-bright/X-ray-faint AGN recently revealed by MIRI (Lyu et al. 2023). Both samples contain a significant fraction of host galaxies with disturbed morphologies at all redshifts sampled, and increasingly so towards higher redshift and AGN bolometric luminosity. The most obscured systems show the highest fraction of strongly disturbed host galaxies at $95\pm4$%, followed by the moderately and unobscured/lightly obscured subsets at $78\pm6$% and $63\pm6.5$%, respectively. From this pattern of disturbances, we conclude that mergers are common amongst obscured AGN, and that the obscured AGN phase may mark a period of significant SMBH growth. This finding presents tension with the leading model on AGN fueling mechanisms (Hopkins et al. 2014) that needs reconciling.

  By using the GRAVITY instrument with the near-infrared (NIR) Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), the structure of the broad (emission-)line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be spatially resolved, allowing the central black hole (BH) mass to be determined. This work reports new NIR VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric spectra for four type 1 AGNs (Mrk 509, PDS 456, Mrk 1239, and IC 4329A) with resolved broad-line emission. Dynamical modelling of interferometric data constrains the BLR radius and central BH mass measurements for our targets and reveals outflow-dominated BLRs for Mrk 509 and PDS 456. We present an updated radius-luminosity (R-L) relation independent of that derived with reverberation mapping (RM) measurements using all the GRAVITY-observed AGNs. We find our R-L relation to be largely consistent with that derived from RM measurements except at high luminosity, where BLR radii seem to be smaller than predicted. This is consistent with RM-based claims that high Eddington ratio AGNs show consistently smaller BLR sizes. The BH masses of our targets are also consistent with the standard $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$\sigma_*$ relation. Model-independent photocentre fitting shows spatial offsets between the hot dust continuum and the BLR photocentres (ranging from $\sim$17 $\mu$as to 140 $\mu$as) that are generally perpendicular to the alignment of the red- and blueshifted BLR photocentres. These offsets are found to be related to the AGN luminosity and could be caused by asymmetric K-band emission of the hot dust, shifting the dust photocentre. We discuss various possible scenarios that can explain this phenomenon.

  We present a comparative study of the constrained parameters of active galactic nuclei (AGN) made by the public X-ray reverberation model kynxilrev and kynrefrev that make use of the reflection code xillver and reflionx, respectively. By varying the central mass ($M_{\rm BH}$), coronal height ($h$), inclination ($i$), photon index of the continuum emission ($\Gamma$) and source luminosity ($L$), the corresponding lag-frequency spectra can be produced. We select only the simulated AGN where their lag amplitude ($\tau$) and $M_{\rm BH}$ follow the known mass-scaling law. In these mock samples, we show that $\tau$ and $h$ are correlated and can possibly be used as an independent scaling law. Furthermore, $h$ (in gravitational units) is also found to be positively scaled with $M_{\rm BH}$, suggesting a more compact corona in lower-mass AGN. Both models reveal that the coronal height mostly varies between $\sim 5$-$15~r_{\rm g}$, with the average height at $\sim 10~r_{\rm g}$ and can potentially be found from low- to high-mass AGN. Nevertheless, the kynxilrev seems to suggest a lower $M_{\rm BH}$ and $h$ than the kynrefrev. This inconsistency is more prominent in lower-spin AGN. The significant correlation between the source height and luminosity is revealed only by kynrefrev, suggesting the $h$-$L$ relation is probably model dependent. Our findings emphasize the differences between these reverberation models that raises the question of biases in parameter estimates and inferred correlations.

  Different studies have reported the so-called temperature problem of the narrow line region (NLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Its origin is still an open issue. To properly address its cause, a trustworthy temperature indicator is required. We propose that the weak [ArIV] 4711,40A doublet is the appropriate tool for evaluating the density of the high excitation plasma. We subsequently made use of the recent S7 survey sample to extract reliable measurements of the weak [ArIV] doublet in 16 high excitation Seyfert 2s. As a result we could derive the plasma density of the NLR of our Seyfert 2 sample and compare the temperature inferred from the observed [OIII] (4363A/5007A) ratios. It was found that 13 Seyfert 2s cluster near similar values as the [OIII] (4363A/5007A) ratio, at a mean value of 0.0146+-0.0020. Three objects labeled outliers stand out at markedly higher [OIII] values (&gt; 0.03). If for each object one assumes a single density, the values inferred from the [ArIV] doublet for the 13 clustering objects all lie below 60,000 cm-3, indicating that the [OIII] (4363A/5007A) ratios in these objects is a valid tracer of plasma temperature. Even when assuming a continuous power-law distribution of the density, the inferred cut-off density required to reproduce the observed [ArIV] doublet is in all cases &lt; 1E5.1 cm-3. The average NLR temperature inferred for the 13 Seyfert 2s is 13,000+-703 K, which photoionization models have difficulty reproducing. Subsequently we considered different mechanisms to account for the observed [OIII] ratios. For the three outliers, a double-bump density distribution is likely required, with the densest component having a density &gt; 1E6 cm-3.
