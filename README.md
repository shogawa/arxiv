  An unresolved question in studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is whether their different classes probe different evolutionary stages of black hole--host galaxy interaction. We present the projected two-point cross-correlation function between a sample of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)-matched AGN selected from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) optical + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ($WISE$) mid-IR photometry, and DESI-designated luminous red galaxies, for $z\in 0.5-1.0$. The total overlap area is 43.4 deg$^2$, including $\sim27,000$ spectroscopic LRGs in our redshift range. We visually classified 1,991 matched HSC-DESI objects in our redshift range, spectroscopically confirming that 1,517 ($76\%$) of them are AGN. Of these 1,517 objects, $73\%$ are broad-line AGN, $27\%$ are obscured AGN. We infer that the parent HSC+$WISE$ AGN catalog has a number density of at least $\sim 240$ deg$^{-2}$, confirming it is one of the most complete optical/infrared AGN catalog to date. We investigate the AGN clustering as a function of the spectroscopic classification and infer the halo mass for each sample. The inferred average mass of the halos $\langle M_h\rangle$ that host unobscured broad-line AGN ($M_h \approx 10^{13.4}h^{-1}M_\odot$) is $\sim 5.5\times$ larger than the halos that host obscured AGN ($M_h \approx 10^{12.6}\, h^{-1}M_\odot$), at $2.8\sigma$ significance, in the same sense as our prior work based on photometric redshifts. This suggests that we may relax our concerns about systematic shifts in the inferred redshift distribution producing this halo mass difference. While we do not yet find statistically significant spectroscopic evidence that unobscured AGN reside in more massive halos than their obscured counterparts, further analyses are necessary to distinguish if more complex evolutionary histories are needed to model these AGN populations.

  We exploit the VST ATLAS quasar/QSO catalogue to perform three measurements of the quasar halo mass profile. First, we make a new estimate of the angular auto-correlation function of $\approx230,000$ ATLAS quasars with $z_{photo}\lesssim 2.5$ and $17&lt;g&lt;22$. By comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM mass clustering correlation function, we measure the quasar bias to be $b_Q\approx2.1$, implying a quasar halo mass of $M_{halo}\approx8.5\times10^{11}$h$^{-1} M_\odot$. Second, we cross-correlate these $z\approx1.7$ ATLAS quasars with the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing maps, detecting a somewhat stronger signal at $4'&lt;\theta&lt;60'$ than previous authors. Scaling these authors' model fit to our data we estimate a quasar host halo mass of $M_{halo}\approx8.3\times10^{11}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$. Third, we fit Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model parameters to our quasar auto-correlation function and from the derived halo mass function we estimate a quasar halo mass of $M_{halo}\approx2.5\times10^{12}$h$^{-1} M_\odot$. We then compare our HOD model prediction to our quasar-CMB lensing result, confirming their consistency. We find that most ($\approx2/3$) QSOs have halo masses within a factor of $\approx3$ of this average mass. An analysis based on the probability of X-ray detections of AGN in galaxies and the galaxy stellar mass function gives a similarly small mass range. Finally, we compare the quasar halo mass and luminosity functions and suggest that gravitational growth may produce the constant space density with redshift seen in the quasar luminosity function.
