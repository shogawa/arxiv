  The detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes with masses $\sim\,80-150\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ suggests that some proportion of black hole binary systems form hierarchically in dense astrophysical environments, as most stellar evolution models cannot explain the origin of these massive black holes through isolated binary evolution. A significant fraction of such mergers could occur in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN), however connecting individual black hole mergers to host galaxies is a challenging endeavor due to large localization uncertainties. We assess the feasibility of determining the fraction of hierarchically merging black hole binaries by computing the angular cross-correlation between gravitational wave localization posteriors and galaxy catalog skymaps. We forecast when the clustering of gravitational wave sky localizations can be measured accurately enough to distinguish the AGN origin scenario from hierarchical mergers in galaxies that do not host AGN. We find that if the observed merging population is dominated by binaries formed dynamically in AGN, then this could be determined with $\mathcal{O}(5000)$ mergers detected at the sensitivity that is projected for the upcoming A\# gravitational wave detectors.   

Super-Accreting Active Galactic Nuclei as Neutrino Sources

  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) often exhibit broad-line regions (BLRs), populated by high-velocity clouds in Keplerian orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) at subparsec scales. During episodes of intense super-Eddington accretion, the disk can launch a powerful radiation-driven wind that overtakes the BLR clouds, forming bowshocks. Two shocks arise: one into the wind and another into the cloud. If adiabatic, electrons and protons are efficiently accelerated via Fermi processes to relativistic energies. In dense winds, the resulting high-energy photons are absorbed and reprocessed within the photosphere, while neutrinos from inelastic $pp$ collisions escape. We explore the potential of super-accreting AGNs as neutrino sources and propose a new class of emitter: an AGN without jets or gamma-ray counterparts, but with a strong opaque disk wind. As a case study, we consider a SMBH with $M_{\rm BH}=10^6,M_{\odot}$ and accretion rates consistent with tidal disruption events (TDEs). We compute the main cooling processes for relativistic particles and show that super-Eddington SMBHs can produce detectable neutrino fluxes with only weak electromagnetic signatures. Such fluxes may be observable by IceCube-Gen2 in nearby galaxies with a high BLR cloud filling factor. For more massive black holes, detection remains possible with moderate filling factors if the source is close, or at larger distances if the filling factor is high. Our model thus provides a plausible scenario for extragalactic neutrino sources, where both flux and timescale are determined by the number of orbiting clouds and the duration of the super-accreting phase.

  The nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) has largely been investigated through their continuum emission, with lines assumed to arise from a broad-line region. In this paper, we instead use recombination lines to infer the intrinsic properties of the central engine of LRDs. Our analysis first reveals a tension between the ionizing properties implied from H$\alpha$ and HeII$\,\lambda$4686. The high H$\alpha$ EWs require copious H-ionizing photons, more than the bluest AGN ionizing spectra can provide. In contrast, HeII emission is marginally detected, and its low EW is, at most, consistent with the softest AGN spectra. The low HeII/H$\beta$ ($\sim10^{-2}$, $&lt;20\times$ local AGN median) further points to an unusually soft ionizing spectrum. We extend our analysis to dense gas environments (the ``black-hole star'' hypothesis), and find that hydrogen recombination lines become optically thick and lose diagnostic power, but HeII remains optically thin and a robust tracer. Photoionization modeling with Cloudy rules out standard AGN accretion disk spectra. Alternative explanations include: exotic AGN with red rest-optical emission; a very high {\it average} optical depth ($&gt;10$) from gas/dust; and/or soft ionizing spectra with abundant H-ionizing photons, consistent with e.g., a cold accretion disk or a composite of AGN and stars. The latter is an intriguing scenario since high hydrogen densities are highly conducive for star formation, and nuclear star clusters are found in the immediate vicinity of local massive black holes. While previous studies have mostly focused on features dominated by the absorbing hydrogen cloud, the HeII-based diagnostic proposed here represents a crucial step toward understanding the central engine of LRDs.

  The faint radio-source population includes sources dominated both by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN), encoding the evolution of activity in the Universe. To investigate its nature, we probabilistically classified 4,471 radio sources at z &lt; 0.947 using low-frequency radio data from the LoTSS Deep Fields alongside a multi-component model for nebular emission, sampled by spectra obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). This was done by combining three tools: (i) the identification of a radio excess, (ii) the BPT diagram, and (iii) a modified Mass Excitation diagram, alongside Monte Carlo methods to estimate the probability that each source is either a star-forming galaxy (SFG), a radio-quiet AGN (RQ AGN), or a high-\low-excitation radio galaxy (HERG or LERG). This approach extends the probabilistic classification framework of previous works by nearly doubling the redshift range, such that we can now probabilistically classify sources over the latter half of cosmic history. Often regarded as the 'gold standard' method, spectroscopic classifications allow us to evaluate the performance of other methods. Using a 90 per cent reliability threshold, we find reasonable overall agreement (~77 per cent) with state-of-the-art photometric classifications, but significant differences remain, including that we identify 2-5 times more RQ AGN. Furthermore, our high-confidence spectroscopic classifications show that radiatively-efficient and inefficient AGN exhibit clearly distinct Eddington-scaled accretion rate distributions, contrary to recent findings in the literature. Overall, our results highlight the need for new and forthcoming spectroscopic campaigns targeting radio sources, on the pathway to the SKA.
