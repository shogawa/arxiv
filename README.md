  Relatively blue light extends beyond a spiral disk from a radius of ~5 kpc out to ~14 kpc from the center of NGC 1275. Analyses of its spectrum and broadband colors reveal a population of young stars having sub-solar metallicities superposed on a dominant population of old stars having super-solar metallicities. The young stars have a characteristic age of ~160 Myr and may span ages of a few hundred Myr, similar to that of stars comprising the central spiral disk, and a total mass about one-third that of this disk for a combined stellar mass (at birth) of ~4 $\times$ 10$^9$ $\rm M_\odot$. A multitude of arc-like features embedded in the extended blue light have brightnesses comparable to the somewhat older (~500 Myr) super star clusters (SSCs) projected against the central spiral disk. The SSCs have a relatively shallow mass function, suggesting that the tidal disruption of an initially larger population that we estimate could have had an initial total mass (far) exceeding ~1 $\times$ 10$^9$ $\rm M_\odot$ gave rise to the extended blue light -- the arc-like features corresponding to stellar streams tracing disrupted star clusters -- and perhaps also the central spiral disk. We speculate that, beginning about 500 Myr ago, an enhanced episode of AGN activity in NGC 1275, leaving still visible X-ray bubbles, induced vigorous cooling of the intracluster medium to fuel the formation of numerous star clusters: many were tidally disrupted to leave bluish light at the inner region of this galaxy, with the survivors being the SSCs projected against the central spiral disk.

  Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.
