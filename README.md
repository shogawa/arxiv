  Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim9$-$11$ in active galactic nuclei (AGN) pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars (SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $&lt;10^6\,M_\odot$. They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness $\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS explosions at $z&lt;11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep fields.

  A majority of JWST/NIRSpec/IFU studies at high redshifts to date have focused on UV-bright or massive objects, while our understanding of low-mass galaxies at early cosmic times remains limited. In this work, we present NIRSpec/IFS high-resolution observations of two low-mass ($M_* &lt; 10^9 \ M_\odot$), low-metallicity ($[12 + \log(\text{O/H})] &lt; 8$) galaxies at $z \sim 7.66$ with evidence of hosting AGN. Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-frame optical emission lines, we find flat metallicity profiles, indicative of ISM redistribution by outflows or past merging. We identify kinematical components decoupled from galactic rotation with velocities of $\sim 250 - 500 \ \text{km} \ \text{s}^{-1}$. We argue that these components are likely tracing outflows, possibly AGN-driven, for which we infer outflow rates of $\sim 21 - 40 \ M_\odot \ \text{yr}^{-1}$, suggesting they may suppress future star formation. We compare our observational results to those from the new large-volume AESOPICA simulations, which fully incorporate different models of black hole growth and AGN feedback. We find that our observational results of $v_\text{out}/v_\text{esc}$ and $\dot{M}_\text{out}$/SFR are consistent with the AGN population in these simulations, hinting that AGN-driven feedback may contribute to quenching both in our systems and in a wider population of low-mass galaxies in the early Universe. This novel study demonstrates the necessity of deep IFU observations to decompose the complex kinematics and morphology of high-$z$ galaxies, trace outflows, and constrain the effect of feedback in these low-mass systems.

  Ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources (ULXs and HLXs) are among the brightest astrophysical objects in the X-ray sky. While ULXs most likely host stellar-mass compact objects accreting at super-Eddington rates, HLXs are compelling candidates for accreting intermediate-mass black holes. Our goal is to produce a clean sample of HLXs by removing possible contaminants and characterise the spectral properties of the remaining population. Starting with a set of 115 HLXs detected by XMM-Newton, we identified and removed contaminants (AGNs, X-ray diffuse emission detected as point-like, and tidal disruption event candidates) and retrieved 40 sources for which XMM-Newton spectra are available. We fitted them with an absorbed power law model and determined their unabsorbed luminosities and hardness ratios. We constructed the hardness-luminosity diagram, compared the results with the spectral properties of the HLX prototype, ESO 243-49 HLX-1, and conducted a deeper analysis on a few promising candidates. The resulting HLX population spans a luminosity range from $1\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to nearly $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and is homogeneously spread in hardness between 0.5 and 5. Half of the population has hardness ratios higher than a typical AGN, and could be considered the extension of the ULX population at higher energies. We found four very soft outliers, which are characterised by steep power law spectra and no X-ray emission above 1$-$2 keV, similarly to ESO 243-49 HLX-1. Those with multi-epoch archival data show changes in luminosity up to almost two orders of magnitudes. We show that sources currently identified as HLXs can be more diverse than ULXs and disentangling between different types of objects is not trivial with currently available data. New observations would be beneficial to expand the current sample and uncover the true nature of many objects of this class.

  Tidal disruption events (TDEs) as excellent beacons to black hole (BH) accreting systems have been studied for more than five decades with a single star tidally disrupted by a central massive BH. However, if considering two stars passing through a central BH and being tidally disrupted in a short period, so-called double TDEs could be expected and lead to unique variability features very different from features from standard TDEs. Here, we report such oversimplified double TDEs in the known changing-look AGN Mrk1018, of which 15years-long light curve with plateau features can be described by two main-sequence stars tidally disrupted by the central supermassive BH. Meanwhile, the BH mass determined by the double TDEs is consistent with the M-sigma relation determined value by the measured stellar velocity dispersions in Mrk1018. The results indicate tight connections between the TDEs and the changing-look properties in Mrk1018.

  The Milky Way is surrounded by large amounts of hot gas at temperatures T&gt;10^6 K, which represents a major baryon reservoir. We here explore the prospects of studying the hot coronal gas in Milky Way halo by analyzing the highly forbidden optical coronal lines of [FeX] and [FeXIV] in absorption against bright extragalactic background sources. We use a semi-analytic model of the Milky Way's coronal gas distribution together wih HESTIA simulations of the Local Group and observational constraints to predict the expected FeX and FeXIV column densities as well as the line shapes and strengths. We predict column densities of log N(FeX)=15.40 and log N(FeXIV)=15.23 in the Milky Way's hot halo and estimate that a minimum S/N of 50,000 (25,000) is required to detect [FeX] l6374.5 ([FeXIV] l5302.9) absorption at a 3sigma level. Using archical optical data from an original sample of 739 high resolution AGN spectra from VLT/UVES and KECK/HIRES, we generate a stacked composite spectrum to measure an upper limit for the column densities of FeX and FeXIV in the Milky Way's coronal gas. No [FeX] and [FeXIV] is detected in our composite spectrum, which achieves a maximum S/N= 1,240 near 5300 A. We derive 3sigma upper column-density limits of log N(FeX)&lt;16.27 and log N(FeXIV)&lt;15.85, in line with the above-mentioned predictions. While [FeX] and [FexIX] absorption is too weak to be detected with current optical data, we outline how up-coming extragalactic spectral surveys with millions of medium- to high-resolution optical spectra will provide the necessary sensitivity and spectral resolution to measure velocity-resolved [FeX] and [FeXIV] absorption in the Milky Way's coronal gas (and beyond). This gives the prospect of opening a new window for studying the dominant baryonic mass component of the Milky Way in the form of hot coronal gas via optical spectroscopy.
