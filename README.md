  The nature of dark energy remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern cosmology. One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be the astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling mechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the black hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts $\leq 2.5$. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we show that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy has been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10$\sigma$. Moreover, it turns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized by the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red-sequence elliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the redshifts of $\sim 0.7-2.5$, without the need of black hole cosmological coupling.

  We present a new method to calculate the polarised synchrotron emission of radio AGN sources using magnetic field information from 3-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations. Like its predecessor, which uses pressure as a proxy for the magnetic field, this method tracks the spatially resolved adiabatic and radiative loss processes using the method adapted from the Radio AGN in Semi-analytic Environments formalism. Lagrangian tracer particles in RMHD simulations carried out using the PLUTO code are used to track the fluid quantities of each `ensemble of electrons' through time to calculate the radio emissivity ex-situ. By using the magnetic field directly from simulations, the full set of linear Stokes parameters I, Q, and U can be calculated to study the synthetic radio polarisation of radio AGN sources. We apply this method to a suite of RMHD simulations to study their polarisation properties. The turbulent magnetic field present in radio lobes influences the emission, causing a complex clumpy structure that is visible at high resolution. Our synthetic polarisation properties are consistent with observations; we find that the fractional polarisation is highest (approximately 50 percent) at the lobe edges. We show that for the same source, the integrated and mean fractional polarisation depends on viewing angle to the source. At oblique viewing angles the behaviour of the integrated and mean fractional polarisation over time depends on the morphology of the jet cocoon. Using Faraday rotation measures, we reproduce known depolarisation effects such as the Laing-Garrington depolarisation asymmetry in jets angled to the line of sight. We show that the hotspots and hence the Fanaroff-Riley classification become less clear with our new, more accurate method.

  The last decade has witnessed significant progress in our understanding of the growth of super-massive black holes (SMBHs). It is now clear that an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN: the observed manifestation of a growing SMBH) is an "event" within the broader lifecycle of a galaxy, which can significantly influence the shape and evolution of the galaxy itself. Our view of the obscuring medium that affects the observed properties of an AGN has also undergone a revolution, and we now have a more physical understanding of the connection between the fuelling of (and feedback from) the SMBH and the broader host-galaxy and larger-scale environment. We have a greater understanding of the physics of SMBH accretion, can identify AGNs out to z = 8-10 witnessing the very earliest phases of SMBH growth, and have a more complete census of AGN activity than ever before. This great progress has been enabled by new innovative facilities, an ever-increasing quantity of multi-wavelength data, the exploitation and development of new techniques, and greater community-wide engagement. In this article we review our understanding of AGNs and the growth of SMBHs, providing an update of the earlier Alexander and Hickox (2012) review. Using citation-network analyses we also show where this review fits within the broader black-hole research literature and, adopting the previous article as a snapshot of the field over a decade ago, identify the drivers that have enabled the greatest scientific progress.

  Changing-look active galactic nuclei, or CL-AGN, are AGN which appear to transition between Seyfert Type 1 and 2 over periods of months to years. Several mechanisms to trigger these transitions have been proposed, but we have yet to conclusively determine their cause. Recent studies suggest CL-AGN are hosted primarily in galaxies which are shutting down star formation (Dodd et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2021, Wang et al. 2023), which may indicate a link between galaxy quenching and changing look events. We use Prospector stellar population synthesis software (Leja et al. 2017; Johnson &amp; Leja 2017; Johnson et al. 2021) to model non-parametric star formation histories for 39 CL-AGN host galaxies. We find that $43^{+13}_{-12}\%$ of our gold sample CL-AGN at z &lt; 0.15 are star forming, while $29^{+13}_{-10}\%$ fall in the Green Valley of the stellar mass-sSFR diagram. At z &gt; 0.15, $57^{+13}_{-18}\%$ of CL-AGN in the gold sample are star-forming and $29^{+19}_{-14}\%$ are in the Green Valley. CL-AGN hosts have similar star formation properties to the host galaxies of Seyfert 1 and 2 AGN at z &lt; 0.15 and to Seyfert 2 AGN at z &gt; 0.15. We find no statistically significant differences in the star formation properties of turn-on and turn-off CL-AGN. We also find no evidence for rapid quenching in the Green Valley CL-AGN. We conclude that CL-AGN state transitions are not associated with the formation history of CL-AGN host galaxies on large spatial scales, implying CL-AGN state transitions may instead result from nuclear-scale or accretion disk effects.

  The Euclid mission and other next-generation large-scale structure surveys will enable high-precision measurements of the cosmic matter distribution. Understanding the impact of baryonic processes such as star formation and AGN feedback on matter clustering is crucial to ensure precise and unbiased cosmological inference. Most theoretical models of baryonic effects to date focus on two-point statistics, neglecting higher-order contributions. This work develops a fast and accurate emulator for baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum, a key non-Gaussian statistic in the nonlinear regime. We employ high-resolution $N$-body simulations from the BACCO suite and apply a combination of cutting-edge techniques such as cosmology scaling and baryonification to efficiently span a large cosmological and astrophysical parameter space. A deep neural network is trained to emulate baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum measured in simulations, capturing modifications across various scales and redshifts relevant to Euclid. We validate the emulator accuracy and robustness using an analysis of \Euclid mock data, employing predictions from the state-of-the-art FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations. The emulator reproduces baryonic suppression in the bispectrum to better than 2$\%$ for the $68\%$ percentile across most triangle configurations for $k \in [0.01, 20]\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ and ensures consistency between cosmological posteriors inferred from second- and third-order weak lensing statistics.
