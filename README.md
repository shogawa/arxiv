  We present NOEMA CO(2-1) observations of a nearby, young, low-luminosity radio source, B2 0258+35. Our earlier CO(1-0) study had shown the presence of strong jet-ISM interaction and a massive molecular gas outflow involving 75$\%$ of the circumnuclear gas. Our follow-up CO(2-1) observations have revealed even more complex gas kinematics, where the southern radio jet is driving out molecular gas in the form of a swiftly expanding bubble, with velocities up to almost 400 km s$^{-1}$. We found highly elevated CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratios for the gas belonging to the bubble and also further away from the radio jets. Previous observations have shown that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the host galaxy, NGC 1167, is in a very low-accretion state. Thus, we attribute the high line ratios to the high gas excitation caused by the jet--ISM interaction. The radio jets, despite exhibiting a relatively low luminosity ($1.3 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), are solely responsible for the observed extreme gas kinematics. This is one of the clearest detections of an expanding cold gas bubble in such a type of source, showing that the jets are affecting both the kinematics and physicals conditions of the gas. Our study adds to the growing store of evidence that low-luminosity radio sources can also affect the kinematics and physical conditions of the cold gas, which fuels star formation, in their host galaxies to a significant extent. Hence, such sources should be considered in models seeking to quantify feedback from radio AGN.

  AGN-launched jets are a crucial element in the study of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their closest surroundings. The formation of such jets, whether they are launched by magnetic field lines anchored to the accretion disc or directly connected to the black hole's (BH) ergosphere, is the subject of ongoing, extensive research. 3C84, the compact radio source in the central galaxy NGC1275 of the Perseus super-cluster, is a prime laboratory for testing such jet launching scenarios, as well as studying the innermost, sub-parsec AGN structure and jet origin. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offers a unique view into the physical processes in action, in the immediate vicinity of BHs, unparalleled by other observational techniques. With VLBI at short wavelengths particular high angular resolutions are obtained. Utilising such cm and mm-VLBI observations of 3C84 with the European VLBI Network and the Event Horizon Telescope, we study the magnetic field strength and associated accretion flow around its central SMBH. This is possible, as higher frequency VLBI measurements are capable of peering through the accretion flow surrounding the central engine of 3C84, which is known to block the line of sight to the sub-parsec counter-jet via free-free absorption. Furthermore, we study the magnetic field's signature in the core region, as manifested in polarised light. As part of this analysis we compare our observations to relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we investigate the effect of instabilities on the shape of the jet's parsec-scale funnel and try to connect them to its historical evolution.

  It is commonly accepted that active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a strong impact upon the evolution of their host galaxies, but the processes by which they do so are not fully understood. We aim to further the understanding of AGN feeding and feedback by examining an active galaxy using spatially-resolved spectroscopy. We analyze integral field spectroscopy of the active galaxy NGC 5806, obtained using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We map the dynamics of gas and stars, as well as gas optical emission line fluxes throughout the central 8 x 8 kpc$^2$ of the galaxy. We use emission line ratios to map gas metallicity and identify regions of gas excitation dominated by AGN/shocks or star formation. We also determine the average stellar population age and metallicity, and model the rotation and dynamics of the galaxy. We find that NGC 5806 has a star-forming circumnuclear ring, with a projected radius of about 400 pc. The dynamics of this galaxy are driven by a large-scale bar, which transports gas from the spiral arm to the central ring and potentially fuels the AGN. We also observe AGN-dominated gas excitation up to 3.3 kpc away from the center of the galaxy, showing the extended AGN effect on the gas in the central regions of the galaxy.

  Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin$^{2}$ across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at $z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}$, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{UV}$=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H$\alpha$ emission (rest-frame EW $2810\pm550$\AA); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope $\beta=-2.34\pm0.36$); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H$\beta$&lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of $\simeq10^{5}M_{\odot}$. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at $z=4-10$, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 ($\approx10^{-4}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.

  We combine the deepest X-ray survey from the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) `7-Ms' survey with the deepest mid-infrared (5.6$ \mu m$) image from the JWST/MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) to study the infrared counterparts and point-source emission of 31 X-ray sources with a median, intrinsic, rest-frame X-ray luminosity of $\log_{10}(L_{\rm Xc}^{\rm 0.5-7keV})$=42.04$\pm$0.22 erg $\rm s^{-1}$. The sample includes 24 AGN with a redshift range, as set by the X-ray detectability, of $z \simeq 0.5-3$. Through a multi-wavelength morphological decomposition, employing three separate classifications (visual, parametric and non-parametric) we separate (where present) the luminosity of the point-like AGN component from the remainder of the host-galaxy emission. The unprecedented mid-infrared sensitivity and imaging resolution of MIRI allows, in many cases, the direct characterisation of point-like (i.e. unresolved) components in the galaxies' emission. We establish a broad agreement between the three morphological classifications. At least 70% of the X-ray sources, including some classified as galaxies, show unresolved emission in the MIRI images, with the unresolved-to-total flux fraction at rest-frame 2$\mu m$ ranging from $\sim$0.2 to $\sim$0.9. At high X-ray luminosities ($\log_{10}(L_{\rm Xc}$)&gt;43 erg $\rm s^{-1}$) we derive a consistent rest-frame near-infrared 2$ \mu m$ point-source luminosity to that derived for local AGN, whilst at lower X-ray luminosity we identify an excess in the 2$ \mu m$ emission compared to pre-JWST studies. We speculate this offset may be driven by a combination of Compton-thick AGN components and nuclear starburst, merger driven activity. Our observations highlight the complex nature of X-ray sources in the distant Universe and demonstrate the power of JWST/MIRI in quantifying their nuclear infrared emission. (Abridged)

  Whether the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources originate from disk+coronas or jets is still controversial. In this work, we constructed a strong jet sample containing 50 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 51 low-synchrotron-peaked BL BLacs (LBLs) and 18 intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL BLacs (IBLs) to explore the origin of X-ray emissions. Generally, blazars are the typical radio-loud active galactic nucleus (RL-AGNs) with a powerful jet towards the observer, causing their broadband emissions to be boosted. By considering the Doppler boosting effect, we obtain the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation and the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity (FP) for the strong jet sources: the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation is $L_{\rm{R,int}}\propto L_{\rm{X,int}}^{1.04}$, which favor the jet-dominate mode, the intrinsic FP is $\log L_{\rm{R,int}}=(1.07\pm0.06)\log L_{\rm{X,int}}-(0.22\pm0.10)\log M_{\rm{BH}}-(3.77\pm2.11)$, which can be interpreted by the hybrid mode of Jet+SSD. Our results suggest that the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources are dominated by the jets, but there may also be a small contribution from the disk. In addition, the radio--X-ray correlation and FP of strong jet sources have not a significant dependence on the Eddington-ratio.   

Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution of Active Galactic Nuclei:
  Implications for Cosmological Simulations of Galaxy Formation

  Modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a very important role in constraining modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here, we utilize an advanced supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk model to compute the accretion flow structure and AGN SED across a wide range of black hole mass ($M_{\rm SMBH}$) and dimensionless accretion rates $\dot{m}(\equiv \dot{M}_{\rm acc}/\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd})$, where $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ is the mass flow rate through the disk and $\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$ is the Eddington mass accretion rate. We find that the radiative efficiency is mainly influenced by $\dot m$, while contributions of $M_{\rm SMBH}$ and $\dot{m}$ to the bolometric luminosity are comparably important. We have developed new scaling relationships that relate the bolometric luminosity of an AGN to its luminosities in the hard X-ray, soft X-ray, and optical bands. Our results align with existing literature at high luminosities but suggest lower luminosities in the hard and soft X-ray bands for AGNs with low bolometric luminosities than commonly reported values. Combining with the semi-analytical model of galaxy formation \textsc{L-Galaxies} and Millennium dark matter simulation for the distribution of ($M_{\rm SMBH}, \dot{m}$) at different redshift, we find the model predictions align well with observational data at redshifts below 1 but deviates for higher redshifts regarding AGN detection fraction and luminosity functions. This deviation may arise from improper treatment of SMBH growth at high redshifts in the model or bias from limited observational data. This AGN SED calculation can be readily applied in other cosmological simulations.

  Toroidal structures are a common feature in a wide variety of astrophysical objects, including dusty tori in AGNs, rings in galaxies, protoplanetary disks, and others. The matter distribution in such structures is not homogeneous and can be flattened by self-gravity or become elongated in the vertical direction, as is the case with obscuring tori in AGNs. This led us to consider the more general case of the gravitational potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section. We begin by showing that the outer potential of a homogeneous elliptical torus can be effectively approximated with less than 1\% error by the potentials of two infinitely thin rings with a minor correction term. These two rings have masses each equal to half the total mass of the torus. The most notable feature is that each such infinitely thin ring is positioned at precisely the halfway point between the center and the focus of the elliptical cross-section, regardless of the torus' other parameters. The result, which holds for both oblate and prolate geometries, allows us to find a new expression to handle the outer potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section. The confocal density distribution is a special case. We have found that the outer potential of such a torus is only weakly dependent of the density distribution law. Consequently, even for the confocal inhomogeneous case, the outer potential is well represented by two infinitely thin rings. This approach can simplify problems of dynamics for the systems consisting of toroidal structures. We have also derived the expressions for the external force components exerted by a homogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section, both for the exact form of the potential and for our approximation by two infinitely thin rings. Comparison of the two shows that our model fits the true trend of the force well.
