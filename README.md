  Extreme high-synchrotron-peak blazars (EHSPs) are postulated as the most efficient and extreme particle accelerators in the universe but remain enigmatic as a possible new class of TeV gamma-ray blazars. Blazars are active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with jets of relativistic particles that generate non-thermal emission pointed along the line-of-sight. Their spectral energy distribution (SED) are characterized by synchrotron and inverse-Compton peaks, indicating acceleration of leptonic and possibly hadronic particle populations in the jet. EHSPs are characterized by a peak synchrotron frequency &gt; 1017 Hz with their Compton peak expected to fall in the TeV range. Indeed, the handful of EHSPs detected by Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) have presented challenges where some may be a high-frequency extension of the blazar sequence while others peaking around 10 TeV may represent a different class of TeV emitters. Detections of the high-energy and very-high-energy (HE; E &gt; 100 MeV, VHE; E &gt; 100 GeV) components of the Compton peak will play an important role in constraining the acceleration model derived from the SED. We present the discovery of TeV emission from RBS 1366, a candidate EHSP, by the VERITAS observatory. Using HE and VHE data from the Fermi-LAT and VERITAS observatories, respectively, we characterize the detection by providing an SED and model fit in the context of other EHSP candidates. Our work confirms the status of RBS 1366 as an EHBL.

  Blazars are active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a relativistic jet oriented toward the observer. This jet is composed of accelerated particles which can display emission over the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Spectral variability has been observed on short- and long-time scales in AGN, with a power spectral density (PSD) that can show a break at frequencies below the well-known red-noise process. This break frequency in the PSD has been observed in X-rays to scale with the accretion regime and the mass of the central black hole. It is expected that a break could also be seen in the very-high-energy gamma rays, but constraining the shape of the PSD in these wavelengths has not been possible with the current instruments. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be more sensitive by a factor of five to ten depending on energy than the current generation of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, therefore it will be possible with CTA to reconstruct the PSD with a high accuracy, bringing new information about AGN variability. In this work, we focus on the AGN long-term monitoring program planned with CTA. The program is proposed to begin with early-start observing campaigns with CTA precursors. This would allow us to probe longer time scales on the AGN PSD.

  We developed and trained a pipeline of three machine learning (ML) models than can predict which sources are more likely to be an AGN and to be detected in specific radio surveys. Also, it can estimate redshift values for predicted radio-detectable AGNs. These models, which combine predictions from tree-based and gradient-boosting algorithms, have been trained with multi-wavelength data from near-infrared-selected sources in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) Spring field. Training, testing, calibration, and validation were carried out in the HETDEX field. Further validation was performed on near-infrared-selected sources in the Stripe 82 field. In the HETDEX validation subset, our pipeline recovers 96% of the initially labelled AGNs and, from AGNs candidates, we recover 50% of previously detected radio sources. For Stripe 82, these numbers are 94% and 55%. Compared to random selection, these rates are two and four times better for HETDEX, and 1.2 and 12 times better for Stripe 82. The pipeline can also recover the redshift distribution of these sources with $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ = 0.07 for HETDEX ($\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ = 0.09 for Stripe 82) and an outlier fraction of 19% (25% for Stripe 82), compatible with previous results based on broad-band photometry. Feature importance analysis stresses the relevance of near- and mid-infrared colours to select AGNs and identify their radio and redshift nature. Combining different algorithms in ML models shows an improvement in the prediction power of our pipeline over a random selection of sources. Tree-based ML models (in contrast to deep learning techniques) facilitate the analysis of the impact that features have on the predictions. This prediction can give insight into the potential physical interplay between the properties of radio AGNs (e.g. mass of black hole and accretion rate).   

A Comparison Between the Morphologies and Structures of Dwarf Galaxies

  We study the morphologies and structures of 57 dwarf galaxies that are representative of the general population of dwarf galaxies, and compare their demographics to a sample of dwarf galaxies hosting optically-selected AGNs. The two samples span the same galaxy stellar mass ($10^9 \lesssim M_\star/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{9.5}$) and color range, and the observations are well-matched in physical resolution. The fractions of irregular galaxies (14\%) and early-types/ellipticals ($\sim 18\%$) are nearly identical among the two samples. However, among galaxies with disks (the majority of each sample), the AGN hosts almost always have a detectable (pseudo)bulge, while a large fraction of the non-AGN hosts are pure disk galaxies with no detectable (pseudo)bulge. Central point sources of light consistent with nuclear star clusters are detected in many of the non-AGN hosts. In contrast, central point sources detected in the AGN hosts are on average more than two orders of magnitude more luminous, suggesting the point sources in these objects are dominated by AGN light. The preference for (pseudo)bulges in dwarf AGN hosts may inform searches for massive black holes in dwarf galaxies and attempts to constrain the black hole occupation fraction, which in turn has implications for our understanding of black hole seeding mechanisms.

  We investigate close encounters by stellar mass black holes (BHs) in the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN) as a potential formation channel of binary black holes (BBHs). We perform a series of 2D isothermal viscous hydrodynamical simulations within a shearing box prescription using the Eulerian grid code \texttt{Athena++}. We co-evolve the embedded BHs with the gas keeping track of the energetic dissipation and torquing of the BBH by gas gravitation and inertial forces. To probe the dependence of capture on the initial conditions, we discuss a suite of 345 simulations spanning local AGN disc density ($\rho_0$) and impact parameter ($b$) space. We identify a clear region in $b - \rho_0$ space where gas assisted BBH capture is efficient. We find that the presence of gas leads to strong energetic dissipation during close encounters between unbound BHs, forming stably bound eccentric BBHs. We find that the gas dissipation during close encounters increases for systems with increased disc density and deeper periapsis passages $r_p$, fitting a power law such that $\Delta E \propto \rho_0^{\alpha}r_p^{\beta}$ where $\{\alpha,\beta\} = \{1.01\pm0.04,-0.43\pm0.03\}$. Alternatively, the gas dissipation is approximately $\Delta E = 4.3 M_\text{d} v_\text{H} v_p$, where $M_\text{d} $ is the mass of a single BH minidisc just prior to the encounter when the binary separation is $2r_\text{H}$ (two binary Hill radii), $v_\text{H}$ and $v_p$ are the relative BH velocities at $2r_\text{H}$ and at the first closest approach, respectively. We derive a prescription for capture which can be used in semi-analytical models of AGN. We do not find the dissipative dynamics observed in these systems to be in agreement with the simple gas dynamical friction models often used in the literature.
