  We present here RadioSED, a Bayesian inference framework tailored to modelling and classifying broadband radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using only data from publicly-released, large-area surveys. We outline the functionality of RadioSED, with its focus on broadband radio emissions which can trace kiloparsec-scale absorption within both the radio jets and the circumgalactic medium of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In particular, we discuss the capability of RadioSED to advance our understanding of AGN physics and composition within youngest and most compact sources, for which high resolution imaging is often unavailable. These young radio AGN typically manifest as peaked spectrum (PS) sources which, before RadioSED, were difficult to identify owing to the large, broadband frequency coverage typically required, and yet they provide an invaluable environment for understanding AGN evolution and feedback. We discuss the implementation details of RadioSED, and we validate our approach against both synthetic and observational data. Since the surveys used are drawn from multiple epochs of observation, we also consider the output from RadioSED in the context of AGN variability. Finally, we show that RadioSED recovers the expected SED shapes for a selection of well-characterised radio sources from the literature, and we discuss avenues for further study of these and other sources using radio SED fitting as a starting point. The scalability and modularity of this framework make it an exciting tool for multiwavelength astronomers as next-generation telescopes begin several all-sky surveys. Accordingly, we make the code for RadioSED, which is written in Python, available on Github.

  Star formation rate (SFR) is a fundamental parameter for describing galaxies and inferring their evolutionary course. HII regions yield the best measure of instantaneous SFR in galaxies, although the derived SFR can have large uncertainties depending on tracers and assumptions. We present an SFR calibration for the entire molecular gas disk of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, based on our new high-sensitivity ALMA 100GHz continuum data at 55pc (=0."8) resolution in combination with the HST Pa{\alpha} line data. In this calibration, we account for the spatial variations of dust extinction, electron temperature of HII regions, AGN contamination, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) based on publicly available multi-wavelength data. Especially, given the extended nature and the possible non-negligible contribution to the total SFR, a careful consideration of DIG is essential. With a cross-calibration between two corrected ionized gas tracers (free-free continuum&amp;Pa{\alpha}), the total SFR of the NGC 1068 disk is estimated to be 3.2\pm0.5 Msol/yr, one-third of the SFR without accounting for DIG (9.1\pm1.4 Msol/yr). We confirmed high SFR around the southern bar-end and the corotation radius, which is consistent with the previous SFR measurements. In addition, our total SFR exceeds the total SFR based on 8{\mu}m dust emission by a factor of 1.5. We attribute this discrepancy to the differences in the young stars at different stages of evolution traced by each tracer and their respective timescales. This study provides an example to address the various uncertainties in conventional SFR measurements and their potential to lead to significant SFR miscalculations.   

Mildly Super-Eddington Accretion Onto Slowly-Spinning Black Holes

  JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity AGN at $z&gt;4$ in compact, red hosts (the "Little Red Dots", or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using GRRMHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a SMBH with $M_\bullet=10^7 \,\rm M_\odot$ at $z\sim6$, representing the median population; the SEDs that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates ($1.4&lt;f_{\rm Edd}&lt;4$) with zero spin, viewed at angles $&gt;30^\circ$ from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed $2-10$ keV band reach $\sim10^4$ at $z=6$, $\sim5$ times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs exhibit $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ values outside standard ranges, with X-ray weakness increasing with optical-UV luminosity; they are also extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index $\Gamma=3.1$, mode of $\Gamma=4.4$). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot ($&gt;10^8$ K) and highly-relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing a SMBH within $10^\circ$ of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a $\sim1.5\%$ probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray weak LRDs at $z\sim6$ from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains $50\%$ of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of $\sim3$. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.

  We present a catalog of optical and infrared identifications (ID) of X-ray sources in the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Deep field detected with Chandra covering $\sim 0.34\,{\rm deg^{2}}$ with 0.5-2 keV flux limits ranging $\sim 2 \mathrm{-} 20\times 10^{-16}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The optical/near-infrared counterparts of the X-ray sources are taken from our Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC)/Subaru and Wide-Field InfraRed Camera (WIRCam)/Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) data because these have much more accurate source positions due to their spatial resolution than that of {Chandra} and longer wavelength infrared data. We concentrate our identifications in the HSC $g$ band and WIRCam $K_{\rm s}$ band-based catalogs. To select the best counterpart, we utilize a novel extension of the likelihood-ratio (LR) analysis, where we use the X-ray flux as well as $g - K_{\rm s}$ colors to calculate the likelihood ratio. Spectroscopic and photometric redshifts of the counterparts are summarized. Also, simple X-ray spectroscopy is made on the sources with sufficient source counts.   We present the resulting catalog in an electronic form. The main ID catalog contains 403 X-ray sources and includes X-ray fluxes, luminosities, $g$ and $K_{\rm s}$ band magnitudes, redshifts, and their sources, optical spectroscopic properties, as well as intrinsic absorption column densities and power-law indices from simple X-ray spectroscopy. The identified X-ray sources include 27 Milky-Way objects, 57 type I AGNs, 131 other AGNs, and 15 galaxies. The catalog serves as a basis for further investigations of the properties of the X-ray and near-infrared sources in this field. (Abridged)
