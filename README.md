  In this work, we revisit the relationship between [O III] line width $w_{\rm 90}$ (as the indicator of AGN outflow velocity) and the radio emission in RQQs by employing a large sample of Type I quasars ($\sim 37,000$) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release Sixteen. By median stacking the radio images (to include the dominant fraction of individually radio non-detected RQQs) of Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (VLASS) for subsamples of RQQs with different $w_{\rm 90}$, our study demonstrates that, the correlation between $w_{\rm 90}$ and radio emission in our SDSS RQQs is significant, and remains solid after controlling the effects of black hole mass, quasar luminosity, Eddington ratio and redshift. This intrinsic link supports that the [O III] outflows in quasars, most likely resulted from wide-angled sub-relativistic quasar winds launched from the accretion disc, could make a dominant contribution to radio emission in the general RQQs. Alternatively, the correlation may be attributed to low-power jets in RQQs if they are ubiquitous and could efficiently enhance the [O III] width through interacting with the ISM. Meanwhile, the star-formation rates traced by the flux ratio of [Ne V]/[O II] emission lines display no dependence on $w_{\rm 90}$ after controlling the effects of black hole mass, quasar luminosity, Eddington ratio and redshift. This suggests that the stronger radio emission in RQQs with larger $w_{\rm 90}$ could not be attributed to outflow enhanced (positive feedback) star formation in the hosts. However, this also indicates the outflows, though exhibiting robust correlation with radio power, produce neither positive nor negative feedback to the star formation in their hosts.

  Methods are studied to compute the boosting effects produced by the observer motion that modifies and transfers to higher l the isotropic monopole frequency spectrum of the cosmic background. Explicit analytical solutions for spherical harmonic coefficients are presented and applied to various background spectra, alleviating computational effort. High l frequency spectra are led by higher order derivatives of the spectrum. Tabulated frequency spectra are computed with a relatively poor frequency resolution in comparison with the Doppler shift, calling for interpolation. They are affected by uncertainties due to intrinsic inaccuracies in modelling, observational data or limited computation accuracy, propagate and increase with the derivative order, possibly preventing a trustworthy computation to higher l and of the observed monopole. We filter the original function and the multipole spectra to derive reliable predictions of the harmonic coefficients. For spectra expressed in Taylor series, we derive explicit solutions for the harmonic coefficients up to l=6 in terms of spectra derivatives. We consider filters and study the quality of these methods on suitable analytical approximations, polluted with simulated noise. We consider the extragalactic sources microwave background from radio loud AGN and the 21cm line superimposed to the CMB. Gaussian pre-filtering coupled to a real space filtering of derivatives allows accurate predictions up to l=6, while log-log polynomial representation gives accurate solutions at any l. Describing the 21 cm model variety is difficult, so it is relevant to relax assumptions. Pre-filtering gives accurate predictions up to l=3-4, while further filtering or boosting amplification/deamplification method improves the results allowing reasonable estimations. The methods can extend the range of realistic background models manageable with a fast computation.

  The JWST North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time Domain Field (TDF) is a $&gt;$14 arcmin diameter field optimized for multi-wavelength time-domain science with JWST. Its location within JWST's northern continuous viewing zone offers optimal conditions for time-domain studies with JWST, ensuring year-round observability, absence of bright stars, and minimal Zodiacal foreground interference. It has been observed across the electromagnetic spectrum both from the ground and from space, including with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). As part of HST observations over 3 cycles (the "TREASUREHUNT" program), deep images were obtained with ACS/WFC in F435W and F606W that cover almost the entire JWST NEP TDF. Many of the individual pointings of these programs partially overlap, allowing an initial assessment of the potential of this field for time-domain science with HST and JWST. The cumulative area of overlapping pointings is ~88 arcmin$^2$, with time intervals between individual epochs that range between 1 day and 4$+$ years. We present the discovery of 12 transients and ~100 variable sources to a depth of $m_{\rm AB} \simeq$ 29.5 mag (F606W). The majority of the transients will be supernovae, although at least two are likely quasars. Most variable sources are AGN, where we find ~0.35% (0.04%) of the general $z &lt; 6$ field galaxy population to vary at the 3$\sigma$ (5$\sigma$) level. Based on a 5-year timeframe, this translates into a random supernova areal density of up to ~0.07 transients per arcmin$^2$ (~245 deg$^{-2}$) per epoch, and a variable AGN areal density of ~1.4 variables per arcmin$^2$ (~5184 deg$^{-2}$) to these depths.   

First Observational Evidence for an Interconnected Evolution between

  Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been widely observed in black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs), which often exhibit significant X-ray variations. Extensive research has explored the long-term evolution of the properties of QPOs in BHBs. In contrast, such evolution in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has remained largely unexplored due to limited observational data. By using the 10 new XMM-Newton observations for the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE J1034+396 from publicly available data, we analyze the characteristics of its X-ray QPOs and examine their long-term evolution. The hard-band (1--4 keV) QPOs are found in all 10 observations and the frequency of these QPOs evolves ranging at $(2.47\text{--}2.83)\times10^{-4}\rm\ Hz$. Furthermore, QPO signals in the soft (0.3--1 keV) and hard bands exhibit strong coherence, although, at times, the variations in the soft band lead those in the hard band (the hard-lag mode), while at other times, it is the reverse (the soft-lag mode). The observations presented here serendipitously captured two ongoing lag reversals within about two weeks, which are first seen in RE J1034+396 and also among all AGNs. A transition in QPO frequency also takes place within a two-week timeframe, two weeks prior to its corresponding lag reversal, indicating a possible coherence between the transitions of QPO frequency and lag mode with delay. The diagram of time lag versus QPO frequency clearly evidences this interconnected evolution with hysteresis, which is, for the first time, observed among AGNs.

  Recent deep and wide radio surveys extend the studies for radio-excess active galactic nuclei (radio-AGNs) to lower luminosities and higher redshifts, providing new insights into the abundance and physical origin of radio-AGNs. Here we focus on the cosmic evolution, physical properties and AGN-host galaxy connections of radio-AGNs selected from a sample of ~ 500,000 galaxies at 0 &lt; z &lt; 4 in GOODS-N, GOODS-S, and COSMOS fields. Combining deep radio data with multi-band, de-blended far-infrared (FIR) and sub-millimeter data, we identify 1162 radio-AGNs through radio excess relative to the FIR-radio relation. We study the cosmic evolution of 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and radio-AGNs, which are well described by a pure luminosity evolution of $L_*\propto (1+z)^{-0.31z+3.41}$ and a pure density evolution of $\Phi_*\propto (1+z)^{-0.80z+2.88}$, respectively. We derive the turnover luminosity above which the number density of radio-AGNs surpasses that of SFGs. This crossover luminosity increases as increasing redshift, from $10^{22.9}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at z ~ 0 to $10^{25.2}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at z ~ 4. At full redshift range (0 &lt; z &lt; 4), we further derive the probability ($p_{radio}$) of SFGs and quiescent galaxies (QGs) hosting a radio-AGN as a function of stellar mass ($M_*$), radio luminosity ($L_R$), and redshift (z), which yields $p_{radio}\propto (1+z)^{3.54}M_*^{1.02}L_R^{-0.90}$ for SFGs, and $p_{radio}\propto (1+z)^{2.38}M_*^{1.39}L_R^{-0.60}$ for QGs, respectively. It indicates that radio-AGNs in QGs prefer to reside in more massive galaxies with larger $L_R$ than those in SFGs, and radio-AGN fraction increases towards higher redshift in both SFGs and QGs with a more rapid increase in SFGs. Further, we find that the radio-AGN fraction depends on accretion states of BHs and redshift in SFGs, while in QGs it also depends on BH (or galaxy) mass.
