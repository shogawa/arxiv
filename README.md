  We study lensing of gravitational waves by a black hole in the deep wave optics regime, i.e. when the wavelength is much larger than the black hole Schwarzschild radius. We apply it to triple systems, with a binary of stellar mass objects in the inspiraling phase orbiting around a central massive black hole. We describe the full polarisation structure of the wave and derive predictions for the polarisation modes of the scattered wave measured by the observer. We show that lensing in the wave optics regime is not helicity preserving, as opposed to lensing in the geometric optics regime. The amplitude of the total wave is modulated due to interference between the directly transmitted and lensed components. The relative amplitude of the modulation is fixed by the lensing geometry and can reach unity in the most favourable settings. This indicates that wave optics lensing is potentially detectable by LISA for sufficiently high SNR systems. Our findings show that in the wave optics regime it is necessary to go beyond the usual lensing description where the amplification factor is assumed to be the same for both helicity modes. While motivated by GW190521 and the AGN formation scenario, our results apply more broadly to stellar-mass binaries orbiting a third body described as a Schwarzschild black hole, with a period comparable to the GW observation time.

  Near IR spectroscopic reverberation of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) potentially allows the infrared (IR) broad line region (BLR) to be reverberated alongside the disc and dust continua, while the spectra can also reveal details of dust astro-chemistry. Here, we describe results of a short pilot study (17 near-IR spectra over a 183 d period) for Mrk 509. The spectra give a luminosity-weighted dust radius of $\langle R_{\mathrm{d,lum}} \rangle = 186 \pm 4$ light-days for blackbody (large grain dust), consistent with previous (photometric) reverberation campaigns, whereas carbon and silicate dust give much larger radii. We develop a method of calibrating spectral data in objects where the narrow lines are extended beyond the slit width. We demonstrate this by showing our resultant photometric band light curves are consistent with previous results, with a hot dust lag at &gt;40 d in the K band, clearly different from the accretion disc response at &lt;20 d in the z band. We place this limit of 40 d by demonstrating clearly that the modest variability that we do detect in the H and K band does not reverberate on time-scales of less than 40 d. We also extract the Pa$\beta$ line light curve, and find a lag which is consistent with the optical BLR H$\beta$ line of $\sim$70-90 d. This is important as direct imaging of the near-IR BLR is now possible in a few objects, so we need to understand its relation to the better studied optical BLR.

  The production mechanism of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos is not yet understood. A common assumption is that beamed relativistic outflows (jets) driven by accreting black holes are needed to accelerate particles to such high energies to produce high-energy neutrinos. Indeed, the first astrophysical high-energy neutrino source candidate identified by IceCube at a significance level of $&gt;3\sigma$ was a blazar -- an AGN with an accreting supermassive black hole that drives a relativistic jet directed towards Earth. Recently, IceCube discovered strong evidence that Seyfert galaxies also emit neutrinos, which appears unrelated to jet activity. Here, we show that the neutrino--hard X-ray flux ratio of the blazar TXS 0506+056 is consistent with neutrino production in a $\gamma$-obscured region near the central supermassive black hole, with the X-ray flux corresponding to reprocessed $\gamma$-ray emission with flux comparable to that of neutrinos. Similar neutrino--hard X-ray flux ratios were found for three of IceCube's Seyfert galaxies, raising the possibility of a common neutrino production mechanism that may not involve a strong jet. We examine how future observations could test the jet origin of blazar neutrinos.

  In this paper we investigate the stellar populations and star formation histories of 235 active galactic nuclei (AGN)-host dwarf galaxies, consisting of four samples identified separately with different methods (i.e., radio, X-ray, mid-IR and variability), utilizing the synthesis code STARLIGHT and spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8. Our results show that the variability sample is the oldest, while the mid-IR sample is the youngest, for which the luminosity at 4020 \AA\ is dominated ($&gt;50\%$) by the young population ($t&lt;10^8$ yr). The light-weighted mean stellar age of the whole sample is in general about 0.7 dex younger than the optical sample studie in Cai et al. We compare the population results between fitting models with and without a power-law (PL) component and find that the neglect of a PL component would lead to an under- and over-estimation by 0.2 and 0.1 dex for the light- and mass-weighted mean stellar age, respectively, for our sample of dwarf galaxies, which has a mean fractional contribution of $\sim$16\% from the AGN. In addition, we obtain further evidence for a possible suppression of star formation in the host galaxy by the central AGN. We also find that there exists an anti-correlation between the extinction-corrected [O\,{\sc iii}] luminosity and light-weighted mean stellar age, confirming our previous finding that there is a physical connection between AGN and star-forming activies in AGN-host dwarfs.

  Recently, models of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) rooted on large observational compilations have been produced that, unlike their predecessors, feature a smooth evolution with time. This bypasses the need to assume an ionizing emissivity evolution when simulating helium reionization with observations-based QLF, thus yielding more robust constraints. We combine one such QLF with a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and 3D multi-frequency radiative transfer. The simulated reionization history is consistently delayed in comparison to most other models in the literature. The predicted intergalactic medium temperature is larger than the observed one at $z \lesssim 3$. Through forward modeling of the He II Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, we show that our model produces an extended helium reionization and successfully matches the bulk of the observed effective optical depth distribution, although it over-ionizes the Universe at $z\lesssim2.8$ as the effect of small-scale Lyman Limit Systems not being resolved. We thoroughly characterize transmission regions and dark gaps in He II Lyman-$\alpha$ forest sightlines. We quantify their sensitivity to the helium reionization, opening a new avenue for further observational studies of this epoch. Finally, we explore the implications for helium reionization of the large number of active galactic nuclei revealed at $z\gtrsim5$ by JWST. We find that such modifications do not affect any observable at $z\leq4$, except in our most extreme model, indicating that the observed abundance of high-$z$ AGNs does not bear consequences for helium reionization.
