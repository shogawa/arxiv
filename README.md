  We present new JWST-NIRSpec IFS data for the luminous infrared galaxy NGC7469: a nearby (70.6Mpc) active galaxy with a Sy 1.5 nucleus that drives a highly ionized gas outflow and a prominent nuclear star-forming ring. Using the superb sensitivity and high spatial resolution of the JWST instrument NIRSpec-IFS, we investigate the role of the Seyfert nucleus in the excitation and dynamics of the circumnuclear gas. Our analysis focuses on the [Fe ii], H2, and hydrogen recombination lines that trace the radiation/shocked-excited molecular and ionized ISM around the AGN. We investigate the gas excitation through H2/Br{\gamma} and [Fe ii]/Pa\b{eta} emission line ratios and find that photoionization by the AGN dominates within the central 300 pc of the galaxy and together with a small region show ing signatures of shock-heated gas; these shock-heated regions are likely associated with a compact radio jet. In addition, the velocity field and velocity dispersion maps reveal complex gas kinematics. Rotation is the dominant feature, but we also identify non-circular motions consistent with gas inflows as traced by the velocity residuals and the spiral pattern in the Pa{\alpha} velocity dispersion map. The inflow is consistent with the mass outflow rate and two orders of magnitude higher than the AGN accretion rate. The compact nuclear radio jet has enough power to drive the highly ionized outflow. This scenario suggests that the inflow and outflow are in a self-regulating feeding-feedback process, with a contribution from the radio jet helping to drive the outflow.

  The recent detection of TeV neutrino emission from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 by IceCube suggests that AGN could make a sizable contribution to the total high-energy cosmic neutrino flux. The absence of TeV gamma rays from NGC 1068, indicates neutrino production originates in the innermost region of the AGN. Disk-corona models predict a correlation between neutrinos and keV X-rays in Seyfert galaxies, a subclass of AGN to which NGC 1068 belongs. Using 10 years of IceCube through-going track events, we report results from searches for neutrino signals from 27 additional sources in the Northern Sky by studying both the generic single power-law spectral assumption and spectra predicted by the disk-corona model. Our results show excesses of neutrinos associated with two sources, NGC 4151 and CGCG 420-015, at 2.7$\sigma$ significance, and at the same time constrain the collective neutrino emission from our source list.
