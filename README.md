  We present observations of the $z\sim5.7$ Lyman-break galaxy HZ10 with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU in high and low spectral resolution (G395H, $R\sim2700$ and PRISM, $R\sim100$, respectively), as part of the GA-NIFS program. By spatially resolving the source, we find evidence for three spatially and spectrally distinct regions of line emission along with one region of strong continuum emission, all within a projected distance of $&lt;10$kpc. The R2700 data features strong detections in H$\beta$, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959{,}5007$, [NII]$\lambda\lambda6548{,}6584$, H$\alpha$, and [SII]$\lambda\lambda6716{,}6731$. The R100 data additionally contains a strong detection of the Ly$\alpha$ break, rest-UV continuum, and [OII]$\lambda\lambda3726{,}3729$. None of the detected lines present strong evidence for AGN excitation from line diagnostic diagrams, and no high-ionisation lines are detected. Using the detected lines, we constrain the electron density $\left( \rm \log_{10}\left( n_e / cm^{-3}\right)\sim2.5-3.3\right)$ and metallicity ($\sim0.5-0.7$ solar) in each component. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits of each cube reveal a strong east-west velocity gradient and significant line asymmetries (indicating tidal features or outflows). The western component features a very red UV slope ($\beta_{UV}\sim-1$) and significant H$\alpha$ emission, suggesting an evolved population and active star formation. From a comparison to high resolution [CII]$158\mu$m imaging obtained with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA), we find that the continuum emitter is associated with a gas-poor stellar population. Altogether, these data suggest that HZ10 represents an ongoing merger, with a complex distribution of stars, gas, and dust $&lt;1$Gyr after the Big Bang.

  Broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines (FWHM &gt; 1,000 km s$^{-1}$) are incredibly efficient tracers of the high-velocity clouds encircling Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). As a result, we search for these broad line AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) catalog. We identify 301 broad-line H$\alpha$ galaxies and 801 broad-line H$\beta$ galaxies in the catalog. In total, we detect 1,042 unique broad-line galaxies with luminosities between 10$^{37}$ - 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and inferred supermassive black hole masses between 10$^{5}$ - 10$^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$; 60 feature both broad H$\alpha$ and broad H$\beta$ emission. We also determine that the broad line region radius ranges between 0.01 - 46 light days, with a median radius of 0.1 light days (0.02 pc) for our broad H$\beta$ sample. In addition, we find that both samples feature a higher fraction of galaxy mergers (44% for the broad H$\alpha$ sample and 43% for the broad H$\beta$ sample), compared to the full MaNGA galaxy sample (26%), which suggests that merger-driven fueling is strongly active in our sample.

  Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) data analyses have shown that massive red galaxies existed at redshifts $z&gt;6$, a discovery that is difficult to understand in the context of standard cosmology ($\Lambda $CDM). Here we analyze these observations more deeply by fitting a stellar population model to the optical and near-infrared photometric data. These fits include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and with the same extinction for both (a lower extinction for the younger population is unphysical). Extra stellar populations or the inclusion of an AGN component do not significantly improve the fits. These galaxies are being viewed at very high redshifts, with an average $\langle z\rangle \approx 8.2$, when the $\Lambda$CDM Universe was only $\approx 600$ Myr old. This result conflicts with the inferred ages of these galaxies, however, which were on average between 0.9 and 2.4 Gyr old within 95% CL. Given the sequence of star formation and galaxy assembly in the standard model, these galaxies should instead be even younger than 290 Myr on average, for which our analysis assigns a probability of only $&lt;3\times 10^{-4}$ ($\gtrsim 3.6\sigma $ tension). This outcome may indicate the need to consider non-standard cosmologies. Nevertheless, our conclusions result from several approximations in stellar astrophysics and extinction, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. Further research is necessary to corroborate the possible existence of galaxies older than the $\Lambda $CDM universe at their observed redshifts.

  We present a sample of 22 massive galaxies with stellar masses $&gt;10^{10} M_{\odot}$ at $3&lt;z&lt;4$ with deep H and K-band high resolution spectra (R=3500-3000) from Keck/MOSFIRE and VLT/KMOS near-infrared spectrographs. We find a large fraction have strong [OIII]5007 and H$\beta$ emission lines with large line widths ($\sigma$ 100 -- 450 km/s). We measure the sizes of our galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope images and consider the potential kinematic scaling relations of our sample; and rule out an explanation for these broad lines in terms of galaxy-wide kinematics. Based on consideration of the [OIII]5007 $/$ H$\beta$ flux ratios, their location in the Mass--Excitation diagram, and the derived bolometric luminosities, we conclude that Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their Narrow Line Regions most likely give rise to this emission. At redshifts $3&lt;z&lt;4$, we find significantly high AGN fractions in massive galaxies, ranging from 60--70\% for the mass range $10&lt;\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&lt;11$, with a lower limit 30\% for all galaxies within that redshift range when we apply our most stringent AGN criteria. We also find a considerably lower AGN fraction in massive quiescent galaxies, ranging from 20-30\%. These fractions of AGN point to the period between $3&lt;z&lt;4$ being a time of heightened activity for the development of supermassive black holes in the massive end of the galaxy population and provide evidence for their role in the emergence of the first massive quenched galaxies at this epoch.
