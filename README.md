  Messier 104, NGC 4594, also known as the Sombrero Galaxy, has been extensively studied, especially its structure and stellar halo. Its abundance of globular clusters has given rise to many theories and much speculation (Ford H. C. et al 1996). But other objects in the vicinity of such a spectacular galaxy are sometimes ignored. While studying HST images available on the HST Legacy website of the halo of M104 (HST proposal 9714, PI: Keith Noll), the author observed at 12:40:07.829 -11:36:47.38 (in j2000) an object about 4 arcseconds in diameter. A study with VO tools suggests that the object is a SBc galaxy with AGN (Seyfert).

  Recent associations of high-energy neutrinos with active galactic nuclei (AGN) have revived the interest in leptohadronic models of radiation from astrophysical sources. The rapid increase in the amount of acquired multi-messenger data will require soon fast numerical models that may be applied to large source samples. We develop a time-dependent leptohadronic code, LeHaMoC, that offers several notable benefits compared to other existing codes, such as versatility and speed. LeHaMoC solves the Fokker-Planck equations of photons and relativistic particles (i.e. electrons, positrons, protons, and neutrinos) produced in a homogeneous magnetized source that may also be expanding. The code utilizes a fully implicit difference scheme that allows fast computation of steady-state and dynamically evolving physical problems. We first present test cases where we compare the numerical results obtained with LeHaMoC against exact analytical solutions and numerical results computed with ATHE$\nu$A, a well-tested code of similar philosophy but different numerical implementation. We find a good agreement (within 10-30%) with the numerical results obtained with ATHE$\nu$A without evidence of systematic differences. We then demonstrate the capabilities of the code through illustrative examples. First, we fit the spectral energy distribution from a jetted AGN in the context of a synchrotron-self Compton model and a proton-synchrotron model using Bayesian inference. Second, we compute the high-energy neutrino signal and the electromagnetic cascade induced by hadronic interactions in the corona of NGC 1068. LeHaMoC is easily customized to model a variety of high-energy astrophysical sources and has the potential to become a widely utilized tool in multi-messenger astrophysics.

  Complex Fe-K emission/absorption line features are commonly observed in the 6--11 keV band from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These features are formed in various physical components surrounding the black holes. The Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy Mrk 766, in particular, exhibits characteristic blue-shifted Fe-K absorption lines caused by the ultra-fast outflow (UFO), and a broad Fe-K emission line, as well as variable absorbers partially covering the X-ray emitting region. We re-analyze the Mrk 766 archival data of XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift to investigate the origin of the Fe-K line feature and the 0.3--79 keV energy spectral variation. We have found that the spectral variation in $\lesssim$10 keV is primarily explained by the variable partial covering of the central X-ray source by multi-layer absorbing clouds. The Fe-K line feature consists of the blue-shifted absorption lines due to the UFO, a narrow emission line from the distant material, a broad emission line from the inner-disk reflection, and a slightly broadened weak emission line at around 6.4--6.7 keV whose equivalent width is $\sim$0.05 keV. The last one is presumably due to the resonance scattering in the UFO out of the line-of-sight, as predicted by a Monte Carlo simulation based on the hydrodynamical UFO modeling. We suggest that the seemingly complex Fe-K line features and the X-ray energy spectra of Mrk 766 are explained by a moderately extended central X-ray source around a Schwarzschild black hole, an optically thick accretion disk with a truncated inner-radius, the UFO, multi-layer partial covering clouds, and a torus.

  Emission-line studies in the active galactic nuclei (AGNs), particularly those utilizing high spatial resolution, provide the most accurate method to determine critical quantities of the central engine and of the gas a few tens of parsecs away. Using seeing-limited data with spectroscopy, we have explored the extended narrow-line region for a sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong, forbidden emission lines that have high-ionization potentials (IP $\gtrsim$ 100 eV). We have studied the optical and near-infrared spectra for these AGNs, extracted and compared their spectral energy distributions, and put constraints on the physical conditions of the region producing the coronal lines. We have realized a novel black hole mass scaling relation with one such prominent coronal line - [Si VI] 1.963 microns, over the 10$^6$ - 10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$ interval, that suggests photoionization by the continuum produced by the accretion disk is the primary physical process at play here. We perform a detailed parameter space study to optimize the emission from these coronal lines in terms of fundamental black hole parameters and test predictions that can be used to measure the kinematics of the extended X-ray emission gas. With the successful launch and first light of the JWST, we are well-poised to refine our findings using the superb angular resolution of the telescope that will allow us to map the inner few parsecs to the central supermassive black holes. This opens up the study of the higher ionization lines that will be spatially resolved by JWST, expanding our sample to tens of hundreds of AGNs, and putting firmer constraints on the physical conditions in the coronal line region.

  NGC 5548 has been hailed as an archetypical type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) and serves as a valuable laboratory to study the long-term variation of its broad-line region (BLR). In this work, we re-affirm our finding on the connection between the continuum variability in the optical regime and the corresponding H$\beta$ response to it, in order to realize the increase, albeit with a gradual saturation, in the H$\beta$ emitting luminosity with increasing AGN continuum. This effect is also known as the Pronik-Chuvaev effect after the authors who first demonstrated this effect using long-term monitoring of another well-studied Type-1 AGN - Mrk 6. We employ a homogeneous, multi-component spectral fitting procedure over a broad range of spectral epochs that is then used to create the continuum and H$\beta$ light curves. We focus on the epoch range 48636-49686 MJD, different from our previous analysis. We again notice a clear signature of shallowing in the trend between the H$\beta$ and the continuum luminosities. We attempt to recover this H$\beta$ emission trend as a response to a significant continuum flux increase using CLOUDY photoionization simulations and employ a suitable broad-band spectral energy distribution for this source. We explore the wide range in the physical parameters space for modelling the H$\beta$ emission from the BLR appropriate for this source. We employ a constant density, single cloud model approach in this study and successfully recover the observed shallowing of the H$\beta$ emission with respect to the rising AGN continuum and provide constraints on the local BLR densities and the location of the H$\beta$ emitting BLR which agrees with the H$\beta$ time-lags reported from the long-term reverberation mapping monitoring. On the contrary, we do not find a significant breathing effect in the location of the H$\beta$ line-emitting BLR for this epoch in NGC 5548.   

Modelling the quasar spectra for super-Eddington sources -- The What,

  Broad lines in active galaxies are primarily emitted by photoionization processes that are driven by the incident continuum arising from a complex geometrical structure circumscribing the supermassive black hole. A model of the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) effective in ionizing the gas-rich broad line emitting region (BLR) is needed to understand the various radiative processes that eventually lead to the emission of emission lines from diverse physical conditions. Photoionization codes are a useful tool to investigate two aspects - the importance of the shape of the SED, and the physical conditions in the BLR. In this work, we focus on the anisotropy of continuum radiation from the very centre a direct consequence of the development of a funnel-like structure at regions very close to the black hole. Accounting for the diversity of Type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the context of the main sequence of quasars permits us to locate the super Eddington sources along the sequence and constrain the physical conditions of their line-emitting BLR.

  1ES1927+654 is a nearby active galactic nucleus that has shown an enigmatic outburst in optical/UV followed by X-rays, exhibiting strange variability patterns at timescales of months-years. Here we report the unusual X-ray, UV, and radio variability of the source in its post-flare state (Jan 2022- May 2023). Firstly, we detect an increase in the soft X-ray (0.3-2 keV) flux from May 2022- May 2023 by almost a factor of five, which we call the bright-soft-state. The hard X-ray 2-10 keV flux increased by a factor of two, while the UV flux density did not show any significant changes ($\le 30\%$) in the same period. The integrated energy pumped into the soft and hard X-ray during this period of eleven months is $\sim 3.57\times 10^{50}$ erg and $5.9\times 10^{49}$ erg, respectively. From the energetics, it is evident that whatever is producing the soft excess (SE) is pumping out more energy than either the UV or hard X-ray source. Since the energy source presumably is ultimately the accretion of matter onto the SMBH, the SE emitting region must be receiving the majority of this energy. In addition, the source does not follow the typical disc-corona relation found in AGNs, neither in the initial flare (in 2017-2019) nor in the current bright soft state (2022-2023). We found that the core (&lt;1 pc) radio emission at 5 GHz gradually increased till March 2022 but showed a dip in August 2022. The G\"udel Benz relation ($L_{\rm radio}/L_{\rm X-ray}\sim 10^{-5}$), however, is still within the expected range for radio-quiet AGN and further follow-up radio observations are currently being undertaken.
