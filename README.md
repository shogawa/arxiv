Winds launched at the scale of the accretion disc or dusty torus in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to drive energy-conserving outflows that shape galaxy evolution. The key signature of such outflows, the presence of a hot ($T \gtrsim 10^9 \, \rm K$), shocked wind component, is hard to detect directly. Observations of AGN outflows typically probe a separate outflow phase: cool/warm gas with $T \lesssim 10^5 \, \rm K$. Here, we show that the density of cool outflowing gas scales with AGN luminosity, serving as an indirect diagnostic of the elusive hot, shocked wind. We use hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO to target the interaction between a small-scale AGN wind of speed $\approx 10^4 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ and galactic discs containing an idealised, clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). Through a new refinement scheme targeting rapidly-cooling, fast-moving gas, our simulations reach a resolution of $\lesssim 0.1 \, \rm pc$ in the cool, outflowing phase. We extract an ensemble of cool clouds from the AGN-driven outflows produced in our simulations, finding that their densities increase systematically with AGN wind power and AGN luminosity. Moreover, the mass distribution and internal properties of these cloudlets appear to be insensitive to the initial properties of the ISM, and shaped mainly by the dynamics of radiative, turbulent mixing layers. The increase in cool outflow density with kinetic wind power and AGN luminosity has profound implications for observational estimates of outflow rates and their scaling with AGN luminosity. Depending on the available outflow and density tracers, observationally-derived outflow rates may be overestimated by orders of magnitude.

Recent results from combined cosmological probes indicate that the Dark Energy component of the Universe could be dynamical. The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $Ω_{DE}=Ω_Λ+Ω_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $Ω_Λ$ and the scalar field energy $Ω_{x}$. Provided that $Ω_{DE}\approx 0.7$, negative values of $Ω_Λ$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z&gt; 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $ΛCDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\gtrsim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ observed at $z\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $Ω_Λ$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M_{seed}\sim 10^2\,M_{\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $Ω_Λ\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin.

Radio observations offer a dust-independent probe of star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, but sufficiently deep data are required to access the crossover luminosity between these processes at high redshift ($z&gt;4.5$). We present three spectroscopically confirmed high-redshift radio sources (HzRSs) detected at 1.3 GHz at $z=4.9$-$5.6$, with radio luminosities spanning $L_{\rm 1.3 \, GHz}\approx2$-$5\times10^{24} \, \rm W \, Hz^{-1}$. These sources were first identified as high-redshift candidates through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of archival Hubble, JWST NIRCam+MIRI, and ground-based photometry, and then spectroscopically confirmed via the $\rm H\,α$ emission line using wide-field slitless spectroscopy from JWST COSMOS-3D. The star formation rates (SFRs) measured from SED fitting, the $\rm H\,α$ flux, and the 1.3 GHz luminosity, span $\sim100$-$1800\, M_{\odot} \, \rm yr^{-1}$, demonstrating broad agreement between these SFR tracers. We find that these three sources lie either on or $0.5$-1.0 dex above the star-forming main sequence at $z=4$-6 and have undergone a recent burst of star formation. The sources have extended rest-UV/optical morphologies with no evidence for a dominant point source component, indicating that an AGN is unlikely to dominate their rest-UV and optical emission. Two of the sources have complex, multi-component rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, suggesting that their starbursts may be triggered by merging activity. These HzRSs open up a new window towards probing radio emission powered by star formation alone at $z&gt; 4.5$, representing a remarkable opportunity to begin tracing star formation, independent of dust, in the early Universe.

Galaxy groups are affected by outflows from central Active Galactic Nuclei due to the shallower gravitational potential compared to galaxy clusters. The group binding energy is comparable to the energy output from AGN, making it an important factor in mutual evolution. We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three dynamically active groups: SDSSTG8102, SDSSTG16393, and SDSSTG28674, which are part of the XMM-Newton Group AGN Project X-GAP sample, a statistically complete sample of 49 galaxy groups. We combine uGMRT 400 MHz observations with 144 MHz LOFAR and XMM-Newton observations to study the radio sources associated with the Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs). The BGGs in SDSSTG8102 and SDSSTG16393 have extended radio emission with asymmetric distortions in their morphologies. SDSSTG28674 has a compact flat-spectrum radio source associated with the BGG and an extended lobe on one side, connected by a faint bridge detected with LOFAR. Integrated spectral indices of the three BGGs are $-0.96\pm0.09$ (SDSSTG8102), $-1.35\pm0.09$ (SDSSTG16393), and $-1.6\pm0.02$ (SDSSTG28674). X-ray images reveal elongated morphologies in all three groups, with SDSSTG28674 showing evidence of a binary merger, while thermodynamical maps highlight temperature variations. In SDSSTG8102, lobes are bent and displaced by IGrM flows, while SDSSTG16393 hosts steep-spectrum relic-like plasma coinciding with X-ray emission. SDSSTG28674, with its ultra-steep spectrum lobe and disturbed morphology, likely traces merger-driven activity, consistent with a remnant or revived radio phoenix. The spectral diversity across the systems reflects different stages of AGN fading governed by duty cycle, source age, and confinement by the hot IGrM.

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) outflows can regulate host galaxy evolution via AGN feedback. Ionised gas outflows have been linked to enhanced radio emission. In the first paper of this series, AGN detected with the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) at 6" were more likely to host an [O III] 5007 outflow than AGN not detected, although only high-powered jets were ruled out as the origin of radio emission. New wide-field, sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at 144 MHz with the ILT now enables a resolved morphological study of this sample. We present the first wide-field, sub-arcsecond images of the Boötes Deep Field at 144 MHz, detecting 4074 sources in the $\sim$0.3" image with a central sensitivity of 33.8 uJy $\mathrm{beam^{-1}}$. For 47 AGN matched in AGN luminosity, we probe radio emission on kiloparsec-scales to investigate correlations with [O III] outflows. This sample spans $z&lt;0.83$, $10^{40}&lt;L_{\mathrm{[O III]}}&lt;10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, and $10^{21}&lt;L_{\mathrm{144MHz}}&lt;10^{24.5}~\mathrm{W~Hz^{-1}}$. We find that if we detect an AGN on both large-scales (6") and small-scales (0.3"), 90$\pm$7 per cent have an [O III] outflow, compared to 63$\pm$9 per cent of sources detected on large-scales, but undetected on small-scales. Furthermore, 17$\pm$6 per cent of sources without an [O III] outflow are detected on kiloparsec-scales, compared to 51$\pm$12 per cent of sources with an [O III] outflow. This implies a connection between [O III] outflows and kiloparsec-scale radio emission, which is likely AGN-driven. In contrast, AGN without an [O III] outflow are dominated by diffuse radio emission, likely to be associated with star formation.

We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151 using the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI). We took open-loop Fizeau images with 66-104 mas (5.8-9.1 pc) resolution in the N-band (at $8.7$ and $10.5~μm$), using the full resolution of the LBTI -- equivalent to that of a 28.8 m telescope. These images were complemented by AO imaging in the LM-bands ($3.7$ and $4.8~μm$), with 50-62 mas (4.4-5.4 pc) resolution. These images bridge the scales between previous Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI)/MIDI and VLT/VISIR data, delivering ELT-like imaging resolution in the N-band. We resolve a dusty torus, (diameter 32 pc, PA$=125^{\circ}$), and detect dusty clouds within the narrow line region. Matching the resolution across four bands, we measured spatially-resolved SEDs of the central $\sim 100$ pc. Modified blackbody fitting revealed dust temperature and extinction profiles, indicating both heating from the accretion disk and additional shock heating due to the radio jet. The spatial coincidence of ionized emission (e.g., [Fe II] and [O III]), extended MIR structures, and radio features further supports the interpretation of shock heating. Comparison with NGC 1068 tests the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei (Unified Model of AGN): Structures are similar, despite differences in orientation and Eddington ratio. NGC 4151's torus is smaller than NGC 1068's following a $r\propto L^{0.5}$ scaling. These thirty-meter-telescope class observations of NGC 4151 and NGC 1068 highlight the need to revise MIR radiative transfer models of AGN to account for jet-related heating.

ALMA continuum measurements of the local ULIRG IRAS 07251-0248 E at 667$μ$m reveal an extremely compact (R &lt; 27 pc) and bright ($T_B$ &gt;200 K) nucleus with an absorbing foreground envelope and a surrounding (R ~ 75 pc) disk or torus seen nearly face-on. The bright and unresolved nuclear emission implies large optical depths ($τ_{667μm}$ &gt;0.5, corresponding to $N_H &gt; 10^{25}$ cm^-2) of hot dust at &gt;500 K. In addition, JWST observations of the source show strong mid-infrared (mid-IR) absorption in the ro-vibrational bands of H2O nu_2=1-0 (5-7 $μ$m) and of other species including CO, HCN, C2H2, CH4, and CO2, and Herschel/PACS observations exhibit strong and saturated absorption due to OH, H2O, CH^+, and CH. We propose a model in which the unresolved ALMA submillimeter and JWST mid-IR continua trace the same nuclear source, the former penetrating deep into the nucleus and the latter probing the nuclear photosphere. The continuum model, which includes trapping of photons (the "greenhouse" effect), indicates that the nuclear ($R_h$ ~ 13 pc) luminosity and luminosity surface density are ~10$^{12}$ Lsun and $Σ_{bol}$~ 5e8 Lsun pc^-2, arising from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) so buried that high-ionization lines are completely obscured. The observed mid-IR gas-phase molecular bands probe outflowing gas with velocities of ~160 km s^-1 and are reproduced with the predicted $T_{dust}$ profile, while the far-IR molecular absorption lines are generated in the surrounding thick disk or torus with $τ_{100 μm}$~10. We conclude that IRAS 07251-0248 harbors a compact obscured nucleus (CON) that hides an AGN currently emitting at quasar luminosity. While the observed outflow could be driven by radiation pressure, we favor the scenario of a (partially) energy-conserving hot bubble caught in a very early phase of the expulsion of the highly concentrated gas at the galactic nucleus.  

The Impact of Galaxy Formation on Galaxy Biasing, and Implications for Primordial non-Gaussianity Constraints

The parameter $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ measures the local non-Gaussianity in the primordial energy fluctuations of the Universe, with any deviation from $f_{\textrm{NL}}=0$ providing key constraints on inflationary models. Galaxy clustering is sensitive to $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ at large scale modes and the next generation of galaxy surveys will approach a statistical error of $σ_{f_{\textrm{NL}}}\sim1$. However, the systematic errors on these constraints are dominated by the degeneracy of $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ with the galaxy bias parameters $b_1$ (galaxy overdensities caused by mass perturbations) and $b_φ$ (galaxy overdensities caused by primordial potential perturbations). It has been shown that the assumed scaling of $b_φ(z)=2δ_c (b_1(z)-1)$ is not accurate for realistically simulated galaxies, and depends both on the galaxy selection and the way that galaxies are modeled. To address this, we leverage the CAMELS-SAM pipeline to explore how varying parameters of galaxy formation affects $b_φ$ and $b_1$ for various galaxy selections. We run separate-universe N-body simulations of $L=205 h^{-1}$ cMpc and $N=1280^3$ to measure $b_φ$, and run 55 unique instances of the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model with varying parameters of stellar and AGN feedback. We find the behavior and evolution of a SC-SAM model's stellar-, SFR- and sSFR- to halo mass relationships track well with how $b_1$ and $b_φ(b_1)$ change across redshift and selection for the SC-SAM. We find our variations of the SC-SAM encapsulate the $b_φ$ behavior previously measured in IllustrisTNG, the Munich SAM, and Galacticus.Finally, we identify sSFR selections as particularly robust to varied galaxy modeling.

Tailed radio galaxies are powerful tracers of interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the intracluster medium (ICM), providing unique insights into cluster dynamics. We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) 144 MHz and uGMRT 400 MHz observations of the cluster MACS J1354.6+7715 (z = 0.3967) to investigate the radio emission associated with its member galaxies and the cluster environment. The dominant tailed radio galaxy in the cluster exhibits a sharply bent tail extending over approximately 300 kpc, with the spectral index steepening from approximately -0.46 +/- 0.21 near the AGN core to approximately -2.43 +/- 0.30 in the outermost regions. Synchrotron modelling of the tail yields a radiative age of 150 +/- 10 Myr, implying a galaxy velocity of 1956 +/- 130 km s^-1, which is of order ~ 0.9 times the escape velocity. We find no evidence of relics or halos in our radio images, and the X-ray morphology from Chandra appears relatively undisturbed, suggesting that the system is a pre-merging candidate. Our results indicate that the radio galaxy is undergoing its first infall into the cluster, providing an excellent laboratory for studying the impact of the ICM on AGN activity and galaxy evolution, and demonstrating how multi-frequency radio observations of tailed galaxies can uniquely probe both AGN lifecycles and the early stages of cluster assembly.

Baryonic feedback processes associated with galaxy formation directly influence the large-scale structure by redistributing gas. Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\leq M_{200\mathrm{c}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.
