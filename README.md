  Jet luminosity from active galaxies and the rate of star formation have recently been found to be uncorrelated observationally. We show how to understand this in the context of a model in which powerful AGN jets enhance star formation for up to hundreds of millions of years while jet power decreases in time, followed by a longer phase in which star formation is suppressed but coupled to jet power increasing with time. We also highlight characteristic differences depending on environment richness in a way that is also compatible with the observed SEDs of high redshift radio galaxies. While the absence of a direct correlation between jet power and star formation rate emerges naturally, our framework allows us to also predict the environment richness, range of excitation and redshift values of radio AGN in the jet power-star formation rate plane.

  Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single interactions\,(BSIs) in active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disks are a potential source of gravitational wave\,(GW) events with measurable eccentricities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of 1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian \emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.

  We present optical/UV photometric and spectroscopic observations, as well as X-ray and radio follow-up, of the extraordinary event AT2019cmw. With a peak bolometric luminosity of ~$\mathrm{10^{45.6}\,erg\,s^{-1}}$, it is one of the most luminous thermal transients ever discovered. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up post-peak showed only a featureless continuum throughout its evolution. This, combined with its nuclear location, blue colour at peak and lack of prior evidence of an AGN in its host lead us to interpret this event as a `featureless' tidal disruption event (TDE). It displays photometric evolution atypical of most TDEs, cooling from ~30 kK to ~10 kK in the first ~300 days post-peak, with potential implications for future photometric selection of candidate TDEs. No X-ray or radio emission is detected, placing constraints on the presence of on-axis jetted emission or a visible inner-accretion disk. Modelling the optical light curve with existing theoretical prescriptions, we find that AT2019cmw may be the result of the disruption of a star in the tens of solar masses by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Combined with a lack of detectable star formation in its host galaxy, it could imply the existence of a localised region of star formation around the SMBH. This could provide a new window to probe nuclear star formation and the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) in close proximity to SMBHs out to relatively high redshifts.

  Super-Eddington Accretion

  The physical origin of Little Red Dots (LRDs)--compact extragalactic sources with red rest-optical continua and broad Balmer lines--remains elusive. The redness of LRDs is likely intrinsic, suggesting optically thick gas emitting at a characteristic effective temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$. Meanwhile, many LRD spectra exhibit a Balmer break, often attributed to absorption by a dense gas shell surrounding an AGN. Using semi-analytical atmosphere models and radiation transport calculations, we show that a super-Eddington accretion system can give rise to a Balmer break and a red optical color simultaneously, without invoking external gas absorption for the break or dust reddening. The break originates from a discontinuity in opacity across the Balmer limit, similar to that of early-type stars, but the lower photosphere density of super-Eddington systems, $\rho&lt;10^{-9}{\rm~g~cm^{-3}}$, implies a significant opacity contrast even at a cool photosphere temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$. Furthermore, while accretion in the form of a standard thin disk requires fine tuning to match the optical color of LRDs, an alternative scenario of a geometrically thick, roughly spherical accretion flow implies an effective temperature $4000{\rm~K}\lesssim T_{\rm eff}\lesssim6000{\rm~K}$ that is very insensitive to the accretion rate (analogous to the Hayashi line in stellar models). The continuum spectra from the latter scenario align with the Balmer break and optical color of currently known LRDs. We discuss predictions of our model and the prospects for more realistic spectra based on super-Eddington accretion simulations.

  We search a sample of 5,685,060 isolated sources in the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) with 14.5&lt;g&lt;15 mag for slowly varying sources with brightness changes larger than ~0.03 mag/year over 10 years. We find 426 slowly-varying systems. Of these systems, 200 are identified as variables for the first time, 226 are previously classified as variables, and we find equal numbers of sources becoming brighter and fainter. Previously classified systems were mostly identified as semi-regular variables (SR), slow irregular variables (L), or unknown (MISC or VAR), as long time scale variability does not fit into a standard class. Much like Petz &amp; Kochanek 2025, the sources are scattered across the color magnitude diagram and can be placed into 5 groups that exhibit distinct behaviors. There are also six AGN. There are 262 candidates (~62 percent) that also show shorter time scale periodic variability, mostly with periods longer than 10 days. The variability of 66 of these candidates may be related to dust. Combining the new slow variable candidates with the candidates from Petz &amp; Kochanek 2025, we have found a total of 1206 slow variables.
