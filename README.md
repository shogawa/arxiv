  We present the analysis of the stellar population and star formation history of 181 MIRI selected galaxies at redshift 0-3.5 in the massive galaxy cluster field SMACS J0723.3-7327, commonly referred to as SMACS0723, using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). We combine the data with the JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) catalogue, in conjunction with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/IR and ACS imaging. We find that the MIRI bands capture PAH features and dust emission, significantly enhancing the accuracy of photometric redshift and measurements of the physical properties of these galaxies. The median photo-z's of galaxies with MIRI data are found to have a small 0.1% difference from spectroscopic redshifts and reducing the error by 20 percent. With MIRI data included in SED fits, we find that the measured stellar masses are unchanged, while the star formation rate is systematically lower by 0.1 dex. We also fit the median SED of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star forming galaxies (SFG) separately. MIRI data provides tighter constraints on the AGN contribution, reducing the typical AGN contributions by ~14 percent. In addition, we also compare the median SED obtained with and without MIRI, and we find that including MIRI data yields steeper optical and UV slopes, indicating bluer colours, lower dust attenuation, and younger stellar populations. In the future, MIRI/MRS will enhance our understanding by providing more detailed spectral information and allowing for the study of specific emission features and diagnostics associated with AGN.

  We present a 3D radiative transfer model for the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of NGC 1365, which is a "changing look" Seyfert 1.8 type AGN. The SED from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR) is constructed using archival data from the UVIT on-board $AstroSat$, along with IR data from the literature. The SKIRT radiative transfer code is used to model the SED and derive the geometry and composition of dust in this AGN. Similar to our earlier SED model of NGC 4151, the nuclear region of NGC 1365 is assumed to contain a ring or disk-like structure concentric to the accretion disk, composed of large (0.1$\mu$m - 1$\mu$m) graphite grains in addition to the two-phase dusty torus made up of ISM-type grains (Ring And Torus or RAT model). We also include, for the first time, an additional component of dusty wind in the form of a bipolar cone. We carry out a detailed analysis and derive the best-fit parameters from a $\chi^2 $ test to be $R_{\rm in,r}$ = 0.03 pc, $\sigma$ = 26$^\circ$ and $\tau$ = 20 for the assumed ring-torus-polar wind geometry. Our results suggest the presence of hot dust at a temperature T $\sim$ 1216 K at the location of the ring which absorbs and scatters the incident UV radiation and emits in the near-IR (NIR). In the mid-IR (MIR) the major contributors are the polar cone and warm dust with T $\sim$ 916 K at $R_{\rm in,t}$ = 0.1 pc. Not only are our model radii in agreement with IR interferometric observations, our study also reiterates the role of high resolution UV observations in constraining the dust grain size distribution in the nuclear regions of AGN.

  We analyze JWST/NIRSpec observations of the CO rovibrational v=1-0 band at ~4.67um around the dust-embedded southern active galactic nucleus (AGN) of NGC3256 (d=40Mpc; L(IR)=10^11.6 Lsun). We classify the CO v=1-0 spectra into three categories based on the behavior of P- and R-branches of the band: (a) both branches in absorption toward the nucleus; (b) P-R asymmetry (P-branch in emission and R-branch in absorption) along the disk of the galaxy; and (c) both branches in emission in the outflow region above and below the disk. In this paper, we focus on the outflow. The CO v=1-0 emission can be explained by the vibrational excitation of CO in the molecular outflow by the bright mid-IR ~4.7um continuum from the AGN up to r~250pc. We model the ratios between the P(J+2) and R(J) transitions of the band to derive the physical properties (column density, kinetic temperature, and CO-to-H2 conversion factor, alpha_CO) of the outflowing gas. We find that the 12CO v=1-0 emission is optically thick for J&lt;4, while the 13CO v=1-0 emission remains optically thin. From the P(2)/R(0) ratio, we identify a temperature gradient in the outflow from &gt;40K in the central 100pc to &lt;15K at 250pc sampling the cooling of the molecular gas in the outflow. We used three methods to derive alpha_CO in eight 100pc (0.5") apertures in the outflow by fitting the P(J+2)/R(J) ratios with non-LTE models. We obtain low alpha_CO x 3.2e-4/[CO/H2] factors between 0.34 and 0.62 Msun (K km/s/pc2)^-1. This implies that outflow rates and energetics might be overestimated if a ULIRG-like alpha_CO, which is 1.3-2.4 times larger, is assumed.   We also report the first extragalactic detection of a broad (sigma=590km/s=0.0091um) spectral feature at 4.645um associated with aliphatic deuterium on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (D_n-PAH).   

The contribution of massive haloes to the matter power spectrum in the
  presence of AGN feedback

  The clustering of matter, as measured by the matter power spectrum, informs us about dark matter and cosmology, as well as baryonic effects on the distribution of matter in the universe. Using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the cosmo-OWLS and BAHAMAS simulation projects, we investigate the contribution of power in haloes with various masses, defined by particles within some overdensity region, to the full power spectrum, as well as the power ratio between baryonic and dark matter only (DMO) simulations for a matched (between simulations) and an unmatched set of haloes. We find that the presence of AGN feedback suppresses the power on all scales for haloes of all masses examined ($10^{11.25}\leq M_{500,\mathrm{crit}}\leq 10^{14.75}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}/h$), by ejecting matter from within $r_{500,\mathrm{c}}$ to $r_{200,\mathrm{m}}$ and potentially beyond in massive haloes ($M_{500,\mathrm{crit}}\gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}/h$), and likely impeding the growth of lower-mass haloes as a consequence. A lower AGN feedback temperature drastically changes the behaviour of high-mass haloes ($M_{500,\mathrm{crit}}\geq 10^{13.25}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}/h$), damping the effects of AGN feedback at small scales, $k\,\gtrsim\,4\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$. For $k\,\lesssim\,3\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$, group-sized haloes ($10^{14\pm0.25}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}/h$) dominate the power spectrum, while on smaller scales the combined contributions of lower-mass haloes to the full power spectrum rise above that of the group-sized haloes. Finally, we present a model for the power suppression due to feedback, which combines observed mean halo baryon fractions with halo mass fractions and halo-matter cross-spectra extracted from dark matter only simulations to predict the power suppression to percent-level accuracy down to $k\,\approx\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ without any free parameters.
