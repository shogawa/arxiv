  The origin of the "Changing-look" (CL) phenomenon in supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open issue. This study aims to shed light on this phenomenon by focusing on a sample that encompasses all known repeating CL active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Through the identification of a characteristic time scale for the CL phenomenon, it was observed that larger SMBHs possess shorter characteristic timescales, while smaller SMBHs exhibit longer timescales. These findings reveal a significant contrast to the traditional AGN variability that has been adequately explained by the AGN's disk instability model. This stark discrepancy highlights a distinct origin of the CL phenomenon, distinguishing it from traditional AGN variability. By properly predicting the characteristic time scale and its dependence on SMBH mass, we propose that the CL phenomenon is likely a result of a variation in accretion rate caused by a sudden change in the supply of circumnuclear gas during the transition between active and passive SMBH fueling stages.

  We introduce the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model FEGA (Formation and Evolution of GAlaxies), which incorporates updated prescriptions for key physical processes in galaxy formation. Notably, FEGA features an unprecedented semi-analytic modeling of positive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. The model combines the latest prescriptions for gas infall and cooling, a revised star formation recipe that incorporates the extended Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, disk instability, updated supernovae feedback, reincorporation of ejected gas, hot gas stripping from satellite galaxies, and the formation of diffuse light. A novel description of AGN feedback is introduced, describing the positive mode as a burst of star formation from a cooling gas fraction. FEGA is rigorously calibrated using an MCMC procedure to match the evolution of the stellar mass and K-band luminosity functions from high redshift to the present, and the local black hole-bulge mass relation. Subsequently, the model is tested against several observed and predicted scaling relations, including the star formation rate-mass, black hole-bulge and stellar mass, stellar-to-halo mass, and red fraction-mass relations. Additionally, we test FEGA against other galaxy properties such as the distribution of specific star formation rates, stellar metallicity and morphology. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of positive AGN feedback can co-exist with its negative counterpart without drastic alterations to other prescriptions. Importantly, this inclusion improves the ability of the model to describe the primary scaling relations observed in galaxies.
