  There is growing evidence for star formation inside outflows of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The formed stars are injected into bulges and give rise to perturbation of bulges. In this paper, we investigate the issues of non-rotating, spherically symmetric bulges under the perturbation of fast, massive outflows with stars formed inside. We show that the potential perturbation of outflows together with injection and dynamical friction of these stars could drive bulge oscillations. Still, we find non-zero radial velocity of bulges will be driven by the episodic outflows of AGNs and after the AGN quenched, the radial velocity will tend to zero within a timescale $\sim\tau_{\rm AGN}$, which is the AGN's lifetime. For some typical values of bulges and AGNs, we find the expansion and contraction velocities are of a few $10\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ for $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ bulges and mass outflowing rate $500\,M_\odot/\rm yr$, which would give observational signatures.

  With the discovery of gravitational waves (GWs), the disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have emerged as an interesting environment for hosting a fraction of their sources. AGN disks are conducive to forming both long and short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and their anticipated cosmological occurrence within these disks has potential to serve as an independent tool for probing and calibrating the population of stars and compact objects within them, and their contribution to the GW-detected population. In this study, we employ Monte Carlo methods in conjunction with models for GRB electromagnetic emission in extremely dense media to simulate the cosmological occurrence of both long and short GRBs within AGN disks, while also estimating their detectability across a range of wavelengths, from gamma-rays to radio frequencies. {We investigate two extreme scenarios: ``undiffused", in which the radiation escapes without significant scattering (i.e. if the progenitor has excavated a funnel within the disk), and ``diffused", in which the radiation is propagated through the high-density medium, potentially scattered and absorbed. {In the diffused case,} we find that the majority of detectable GRBs are likely to originate from relatively low redshifts, and from the outermost regions of large supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, $\gtrsim 10^{7.5} \rm M_{\odot}$. In the undiffused case, we expect a similar trend, but with a considerable contribution from the intermediate regions of lower SMBH masses. Detectable emission is generally expected to be dominant in prompt $\gamma$-rays if diffusion is not dominant, and X-ray afterglow if diffusion is important; however, the nature of the dominant observable signal highly depends on the specific AGN disk model, hence making GRBs in AGN disks also potential probes of the structure of the disks themselves.

  In this study, we develop an artificial neural network to estimate the infrared (IR) luminosity and star formation rates (SFR) of galaxies. Our network is trained using 'true' IR luminosity values derived from modeling the IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of FIR-detected galaxies. We explore five different sets of input features, each incorporating optical, mid-infrared (MIR), near-infrared (NIR), ultraviolet (UV), and emission line data, along with spectroscopic redshifts and uncertainties. All feature sets yield similar IR luminosity predictions, but including all photometric data leads to slightly improved performance. This suggests that comprehensive photometric information enhances the accuracy of our predictions. Our network is applied to a sample of SDSS galaxies defined as unseen data, and the results are compared with three published catalogs of SFRs. Overall, our network demonstrates excellent performance for star-forming galaxies while we observe discrepancies in composite and AGN samples. These inconsistencies may stem from uncertainties inherent in the compared catalogs or potential limitations in the performance of our network.

  Aims. We reported the discovery that a changing-look AGN SDSS J101152.98+544206.4 (J1011+5442 for short) gradually returns to the type 1 state after a short period between 2014 and 2019 in the faint type 1.9 state. Methods. Motivated by the rebrightening in optical and mid-infrared light curves from ZTF and WISE, we obtained the new spectroscopic observations by Xinglong 2.16-m, Lijiang 2.4-m, and MMT 6.5-m optical telescopes in 2024. Results. After changing the optical AGN type from 1 to 1.9 between 2003 and 2015 based on the repeat spectroscopy from the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey, J1011+5442 returns to its type 1 state in 2024. We detect the significant and very broad Hbeta lines (FWHM &gt; 5000 km/s) based on the new spectra, which suggests that J1011+5442 is in the intermediate state between the dim state in 2015 and the bright state in 2003. The long-term optical and mid-infrared light curves also show a brightening trend between 2019 and 2024 as the broad Hbeta line appears. The time lag of about 100 days between the mid-infrared and optical variability is consistent with the prediction of dust reverberation mapping. Conclusions. The behaviors of the photometric and spectroscopic observations of J1011+5442 are consistent with the argument that the repeating changing-look phenomenon is regulated by the variation of accretion rate.
