  We present narrowband-filtered integral field unit (IFU) observations of the Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxy (Hot DOG) WISE J202615.27$+$071624.0 (hereafter W2026$+$0716) at redshift $z=2.570$ using Keck/OSIRIS. Our analysis reveals a multi-component ionized gas outflow structure in this heavily obscured AGN host galaxy. Multi-component Gaussian decomposition of the [O III] and H$\alpha$ emission lines uncovers extremely broad and asymmetric profiles, characteristic of AGN-driven outflows. Kinematic mapping shows spatially distinct structures: the [O III] and H$\alpha$ dominated components (with radii of $1.20 \pm 0.56$ kpc) are separated by a projected offset of $\sim 1.1$ kpc and exhibit divergent velocity regimes. The [O III] outflow reaches a velocity of 3210 $\pm$ 50 km s$^{-1}$, while the H$\alpha$ outflow component attains 2310 $\pm$ 840 km s$^{-1}$. Dynamical modeling supports a biconical outflow structure, with [O III] and H$\alpha$ emissions dominating separate cones and significant dust obscuration of the redshifted outflow. Their comparable momentum outflow rates and energy outflow rates suggest a potential physical connection in their driving mechanisms. Spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis reveals anomalous optical/UV excess, attributed to AGN photon scattering by dust or outflowing material, classifying W2026+0716 as a "Blue Hot DOG". The derived outflow timescale ($\sim10^{5}$ yr) aligns with the evolutionary phase of Blue Hot DOGs, suggesting AGN feedback operates persistently during this transitional stage.

  Brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) are today passive and very massive galaxies at the center of their clusters, still accreting mass through swallowing companions, and flows of cold gas, regulated by radio-mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. However, their formation history is still a matter of debate. We report new results based on millimeter observations performed with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer, mapping the cold molecular gas (CO) that feeds the star formation of distant BCGs. We selected three among the strongest cool-core BCGs at intermediate redshifts ($z\simeq0.4$), namely RX 1532, MACS 1447, and CHIPS 1911. Previous unresolved millimeter observations and multi-wavelength analysis showed that they are among the most star forming (${\rm SFR}\simeq100~ M_\odot/{\rm yr}$) and gas rich ($M_{H_2}\simeq10^{11}~M_\odot$) BCGs at intermediate redshifts. The selected BCGs are thus caught in a phase of rapid mass assembly, which makes them ideal targets for high-resolution observations of their molecular gas. By combining NOEMA intensity and velocity maps with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope, we detect in-situ star formation, filaments of accreting cold gas likely regulated by AGN feedback, disturbed morphology associated with tidal tails of molecular gas, as well as gas compression and tails originated from stripping of gas. While effective condensation of the intra-cluster medium is required to explain the large molecular gas reservoirs, the BCGs exhibit a broad variety of environment-driven mechanisms responsible for the processing of their cold gas: flows of cooling gas (RX 1532), ram pressure or sloshing of the intra-cluster medium (MACS 1447), and galactic tides (CHIPS 1911). This study thus sheds new insights on the physical mechanisms responsible for the mass assembly of galaxies hosting AGN at the center of clusters.

  We investigate the evolutionary histories of a population of high mass, high redshift, quiescent galaxies in the cosmohydrodynamical simulation Thesan; studying the characteristic properties of their haloes and environments over the epoch of reionisation. Thesan employs a modified version of the Arepo moving-mesh code utilised in IllustrisTNG, whose explicit handling of ionising radiation couples haloes and galaxies with cosmic reionisation. This results in a regime of rapid growth and quenching, producing nine massive quiescent galaxies at $z = 5.5$, in a $95.5\text{cMpc}^3$ volume, with no counterpart in IllustrisTNG. We find that the rapid assembly of stellar mass is attributed to smooth accretion of mass onto their haloes in dense environments, particularly from massive neighbouring structures; while these galaxies exhibit fast-growing potential wells hosting massive central black holes. With insignificant merger activity, we find AGN feedback to be the primary source of quenching. We find megaparsec-scale densities and halo masses to continue growing after quenching, suggesting that massive quiescent galaxies will be found in some of the largest haloes and densest regions of space by observations. With an unprecedented plethora of massive quiescent galaxies found in JWST data, these reionisation simulations may provide the paradigm for the evolutionary histories of these galaxies, while constraining the relatively unknown physics of reionisation. Despite the rarity of simulated massive quiescent galaxies, their identification in Thesan enables identification of halo and environmental properties most conducive to their quenching, hopefully guiding future efforts into the study of analogous systems in deep observational surveys and large-volume N-body simulations.

  The origin of merging binary black holes detected through gravitational waves remains a fundamental question in astrophysics. While stellar evolution imposes an upper mass limit of about 50 solar mass for black holes, some observed mergers--most notably GW190521--involve significantly more massive components, suggesting alternative formation channels. Here we investigate how heavy black holes merging within Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) disks can become. Using a comprehensive semi-analytic model incorporating 27 binary and environmental parameters, we explore the role of AGN disk conditions in shaping the upper end of the black hole mass spectrum. We find that AGN disk lifetime is the dominant factor, with high-mass mergers (&gt;200 solar mass) only possible if disks persist for ~40 Myr. The joint electromagnetic observation of an AGN-assisted merger could therefore lead to a direct measurement of the age of an AGN disk.

  This study investigates the morphological feature distances among various spectral types of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), including strong and weak Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO), quiescent, and star-forming galaxies. We evaluated the clustering and relative distances of these spectral types in the multidimensional morphological feature space. The results indicate that AGN and QSOs are more closely associated with quiescent galaxies than with star-forming ones, indicating a potential regulation of star formation by AGN activity. Furthermore, the analysis underlines the role of AGN feedback in the dwarf regime having $\sim$10~50% closer distances from AGN types to the quiescent type than to the SF type in the dwarf regime $-18 &gt; M_r &gt; -20$, compared to $&lt;$15% closer in the massive regime $M_r &lt; -21$. The continuous probability analysis for being Hubble types of the spectral types upholds the distance analysis results having a range of the probability distribution of AGN types similar to quiescent type, especially in dwarf galaxies.

  Accretion disk winds are commonly observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The winds may be associated with the changing spectral properties of such sources, yet such connections have not been studied in detail so far. This paper presents detailed calculations of accretion disk winds and their impact on the observed spectrum of AGN, emphasizing recent observations of Mrk 817. The model consists of a radial and time-dependent mass outflow rate with a half-ejection radius of 50Rg and a variability timescale of 100 days. The resulting spectral energy distribution (SED) is characterized by a large drop in the ionizing luminosity and less significant changes in the optical luminosity. The time-dependent intensities of the broad emission lines and the spectrum emitted by the wind material reflect these variations. For Mrk 817, the variability timescale of the 1500-5500A continuum, the thermal time of the disk at the locations where most of this radiation is emitted, and the range of radii over which most of the mass outflow is taking place are all in agreement with the black hole mass and the radial-dependent accretion rate through the disk. This suggests a general connection between time-dependent disk winds, SED shape, thermal timescale, and optical-UV variability in AGN.

  The gas-phase oxygen abundance of the circumnuclear regions around supermassive black holes (SMBH) has been claimed to be affected by the presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). However, there is currently no consensus on the mechanism driving this effect. In this work, we explore whether the interplay between AGN activity and the Ram Pressure Stripping (RPS) can influence the metallicity distributions of nearby (z &lt; 0.07) galaxies. To this aim, we measure the spatially resolved gas-phase oxygen abundances of 10 stripped AGN hosts from the GASP survey, as well as 52 AGN hosts found in the field, which are undisturbed by the effects of ram pressure, drawn from the MaNGA DR15. We find that the metal distributions in these two samples do not differ significantly. Only 2 out of the 10 RP-stripped AGNs present lower oxygen abundances at any given radius than the rest of the AGN sample. Overall, this result highlights that the AGN-RPS interplay does not play a significant role in shaping the metallicity distributions of stripped galaxies within 1.5 times the galaxy's effective radius (r &lt; 1.5 Re). However, larger samples are required to draw more definitive conclusions. By including a control sample of SF galaxies, we observe that the AGN hosts are more metal-enriched than SF galaxies at any given radius. More than that, the steepness of the gradients in the nuclear regions (r &lt; 0.5 Re) is greater in AGN hosts than in SF galaxies. These results favor the hypothesis that the AGN activity is causing metal pollution in the galaxy's nuclear regions.

  In this manuscript, we report evidence to support the dependence of D{\it n}4000 (4000\AA~ break strength to trace stellar ages) on central AGN activity traced by narrow emission line properties in local Type-2 AGN in SDSS DR16. Based on the measured D{\it n}4000 and flux ratios of [O~{\sc iii}] to narrow H$\beta$ (O3HB) and [N~{\sc ii}] to narrow H$\alpha$ (N2HA) and narrow H$\alpha$ line luminosity $L_{H\alpha}$, linear dependence of the D{\it n}4000 on the O3HB, N2HA and $L_{H\alpha}$ in the local Type-2 AGN can provide clues to support the dependence of D{\it n}4000 on properties of narrow emission lines. Linear correlations between the D{\it n}4000 and the O3HB and N2HA can be found in the local Type-2 AGN, with Spearman rank correlations about -0.39 and 0.53. Meanwhile, stronger dependence of the D{\it n}4000 on the $L_{H\alpha}$ can be confirmed in Type-2 AGN, with Spearman rank correlation coefficient about -0.7. Moreover, combining the $L_{H\alpha}$ and the N2HA, a more robust and stronger linear correlation can be confirmed between the D{\it n}4000 and the new parameter $LR=0.2\log(L_{H\alpha})-0.5\log(\rm N2HA)$, with Spearman rank correlation coefficient about -0.76 and with smaller RMS scatters. After considering necessary effects, the dependence of D{\it n}4000 on $LR$ is stable and robust enough for the local Type-2 AGN, indicating the $LR$ on the narrow emission lines can be treated as a better indicator to statistically trace stellar ages of samples of more luminous AGN with weaker host galaxy absorption features.
