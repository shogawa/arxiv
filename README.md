  We present a new standard acronym for Active Galactic Nuclei, finally settling the argument of AGN vs. AGNs. Our new standard is not only etymologically superior (following the consensus set by SNe), but also boasts other linguistic opportunities, connecting strongly with relevant theology and streamlining descriptions of AGN properties.

  We present the third catalog release of the wide-area (31.3 deg$^2$) Stripe 82 X-ray survey. This catalog combines previously published X-ray source properties with multiwavelength counterparts and photometric redshifts, presents 343 new spectroscopic redshifts, and provides black hole masses for 1396 Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). With spectroscopic redshifts for 3457 out of 6181 Stripe 82X sources, the survey has a spectroscopic completeness of 56%. This completeness rises to 90% when considering the contiguous portions of the Stripe 82X survey with homogeneous X-ray coverage at an optical magnitude limit of $r&lt;22$. Within that portion of the survey, 23% of AGN can be considered obscured by being either a Type 2 AGN, reddened ($R-K &gt; 4$, Vega), or X-ray obscured with a column density $N_{\rm H} &gt; 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Unlike other surveys, there is only a 18% overlap between Type 2 and X-ray obscured AGN. We calculated black hole masses for Type 1 AGN that have SDSS spectra using virial mass estimators calibrated on the H$\beta$, MgII, H$\alpha$, and CIV emission lines. We find systematic differences in these black hole mass estimates, indicating that statiscal analyses should use black hole masses calculated from the same formula to minimize systematic bias. We find that the highest luminosity AGN are accreting at the highest Eddington ratios, consistent with the picture that most mass accretion happens in the phase when the AGN is luminous ($L_{\rm 2-10 keV} &gt; 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$).
