  The photoionization model of narrow-line regions (NLRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been investigated for decades. Many published models are restricted to simple linear scaling abundance relations, dust-free assumption, uniform AGN radiation field, and using one specific photoionization code, which restricts them from providing a satisfactory prediction on a broad range of AGN observations. Through a comprehensive investigation, here we present how the choice of abundance scaling relations, dust inclusion, AGN radiation fields, and different photoionization codes CLOUDY and MAPPINGS affect the predictions on the strength of strong UV, optical, and infrared emission lines. We find the dust-depleted radiation pressure-dominated AGN model built with the latest non-linear abundance sets and photoionization code MAPPINGS V are consistent with AGN observations across a broad range of wavelengths. We also assess new potential HII-AGN separation diagrams in the optical and UV wavelengths.

  We present radio very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and X-ray studies of the starburst galaxy NGC 3628. The VLBI observation at 1.5 GHz reveals seven compact (0.7$-$7 parsec) radio sources in the central $\sim$250 parsec region of NGC 3628. Based on their morphology, high radio brightness temperatures ($10^5-10^7$ K), and steep radio spectra, none of these seven sources can be associated with active galactic nuclei (AGNs); instead, they can be identified as supernova remnants (SNRs), with three of them appearing consistent with partial shells. Notably, one of them (W2) is likely a nascent radio supernova and appears to be consistent with the star formation rate of NGC 3628 when assuming a canonical initial mass function. The VLBI observation provides the first precise measurement of the diameter of the radio sources in NGC 3628, which allow us to fit a well-constrained radio surface brightness - diameter ($\Sigma-D$) correlation by including the detected SNRs. Furthermore, future VLBI observations can be conducted to measure the expansion velocity of the detected SNRs. In addition to our radio VLBI study, we analyze Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra of NGC 3628. The spectral fitting indicates that the SNR activities could well account for the observed X-ray emissions. Along with the Chandra X-ray image, it further reveals that the X-ray emission is likely maintained by the galactic-scale outflow triggered by SN activities. These results provide strong evidence that SN-triggered activities play a critical role in generating both radio and X-ray emissions in NGC 3628 and further suggest that the galaxy NGC 3628 is in an early stage of starbursts.

  Accretion of black holes at near-Eddington or super-Eddington rates is the most powerful episode that drives black hole growth, and it may work in several types of objects. However, the physics of accretion and jet-disc coupling in such a state remains unclear, mainly because the associated jets are not easily detectable due to the extremely weak emission or possibly episodic nature of the jets. Only a few near/super-Eddington systems have demonstrated radio activity, and it remains unclear whether there is a jet and what are their properties, in super-Eddington active galactic nuclei (AGNs) (and ultraluminous X-ray sources). The deficit is mainly due to the complex radio mixing between the origins of jets and others, such as star formation activity, photo-ionized gas, accretion disk wind, and coronal activity. In this work, we conducted high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations to explore the jets in the highly accreting narrow-line Seyfert I system IZw1. Our observations successfully revealed small-scale jets (with a linear size of $\sim45$ parsec) at both 1.5 and 5 GHz, based on the high radio brightness temperature, radio morphology, and spectral index distribution. Interestingly, the lack of a flat-spectrum radio core and knotty jet structures imply episodic ejections in IZw1, which resemble the ejection process in Galactic X-ray binaries that are in the canonical very high state. The high accretion rates and jet properties in the AGN IZw1 may support the AGN/XRB analogy in the extreme state.

  The recent discovery of new Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at z &gt; 4 with JWST is revolutionising the black hole (BH) landscape at cosmic dawn, unveiling for the first time accreting BHs with masses of 10^6 - 10^7 Msun. To date, the most distant reside in CEERS-1019 at z=8.7 and GNz11 at z=10.6. Given the high rate of newly discovered high-z AGNs, more than 10 at z &gt; 4, we wonder: are we really surprised to find them in the nuclei of z = 5 - 11 galaxies? Can we use the estimated properties to trace their origin? In this work, we predict the properties of 4 &lt; z &lt; 11 BHs and their host galaxies considering an Eddington-limited (EL) and a super-Eddington (SE) BH accretion scenario, using the Cosmic Archaeology Tool (CAT), a semi-analytical model for the formation and evolution of z &gt; 4 AGNs and galaxies. We then calculate the transmitted spectral energy distribution of CAT synthetic candidates, representative of the estimated BH properties in CEERS-1019 and GNz11. We find that the estimated luminosity of high-z JWST detected AGNs are better reproduced by the SE model, where BHs descend from efficiently growing light and heavy seeds. Conversely, the host galaxy stellar masses are better matched in the EL model, in which all the systems detectable with JWST surveys JADES and CEERS appear to be descendants of heavy BH seeds. Our study suggests an evolutionary connection between systems similar to GNz11 at z=10.6 and CEERS-1019 at z=8.7 and supports the interpretation that the central point source of GNz11 could be powered by a super-Eddington (lambda_Edd = 2 - 3) accreting BH with mass 1.5 10^6 Msun, while CEERS-1019 harbours a more massive BH, with M_{BH} = 10^7 Msun, accreting sub-Eddington (lambda_Edd = 0.45 - 1), with a dominant emission from the host galaxy.

  Black holes with masses in excess of several billion solar masses have been found at redshifts 6-7.5, when the universe was less than 1 Gyr old. The existence of such supermassive black holes already in place at such early epochs has been challenging for theoretical models and distinguishing between different scenarios has prompted the search for their progenitors at earlier epochs. Here we present an extensive analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum (from the JADES survey) of GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at z=10.6, revealing the detection of the high ionization [NeIV]$\lambda$2423 transition and semi-forbidden nebular lines tracing gas densities higher than $\rm 10^{10}~cm^{-3}$, typical of the Broad Line Region of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These spectral features indicate that, in addition to star formation, GN-z11 also hosts an accreting black hole. We do not exclude a contribution from extreme stellar populations, however Wolf Rayet stars alone cannot account for many of the spectral properties. The spectrum also reveals a deep and blueshifted CIV$\lambda$1549 absorption trough, tracing an outflow with a velocity of $\sim 800-1000$ km/s, higher than typically observed in starburst galaxies, hence likely driven by the AGN. Assuming local virial scaling relations, we derive a black hole mass of $\rm \log{(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})}=6.2\pm 0.3$, accreting at about 5 times the Eddington rate. While super-Eddington accretion is probably episodic, if it has been occurring for the previous $\sim 100$ Myr, then the black hole could have potentially originated even from a stellar mass seed at z$\sim$12-15. We finally discuss that our finding naturally explains the high luminosity of GN-z11 and can also provide an explanation for its exceptionally high nitrogen abundance.

  Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) have been revealed in a large number of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and are regarded as promising candidates for AGN feedback on the host galaxy. The nature and launching mechanism of UFOs are not yet fully understood. Here we perform a time- and flux-resolved X-ray spectroscopy on four XMM-Newton observations of a highly accreting narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy, Mrk 1044, to study the dependence of the outflow properties on the source luminosity. We find that the UFO in Mrk 1044 responds to the source variability quickly and its velocity increases with the X-ray flux, suggesting a high-density ($10^{9}-4.5\times10^{12}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) and radiatively driven outflow, launched from the region within a distance of $98-6600\, R_\mathrm{g}$ from the black hole. The kinetic energy of the UFO is conservatively estimated ($L_\mathrm{UFO}\sim4.4\%L_\mathrm{Edd}$), reaching the theoretical criterion to affect the evolution of the host galaxy. We also find emission lines, from a large-scale region, have a blueshift of $2700-4500$ km/s in the spectra of Mrk 1044, which is rarely observed in AGN. By comparing with other sources, we propose a correlation between the blueshift of emission lines and the source accretion rate, which can be verified by a future sample study.
