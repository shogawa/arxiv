  We conducted an investigation of the Coma cluster of galaxies by running a series of constrained hydrodynamic simulations with GIZMO-SIMBA and GADGET-3, based on initial conditions reconstructed from the SDSS survey volume in the ELUCID project. We compared simulation predictions and observations for galaxies, ICM and IGM in and around the Coma cluster to constrain galaxy formation physics. Our results demonstrate that this type of constrained investigation allows us to probe in more detail the implemented physical processes, because the comparison between simulations and observations is free of cosmic variance and hence can be conducted in a ''one-to-one'' manner. We found that an increase in the earlier star formation rate and the supernova feedback of the original GIZMO-SIMBA model is needed to match observational data on stellar, ISM and ICM metallicity. The simulations without AGN feedback can well reproduce the observational ICM electron density, temperature, and entropy profiles, ICM substructures, and the IGM temperature-density relation, while the ones with AGN feedback usually fail. However, one requires something like AGN feedback to reproduce a sufficiently large population of quiescent galaxies, particularly in low-density regions. The constrained simulations of the Coma cluster thus provide a test bed to understand processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution.

  Drawing from the Chandra archive and using a carefully selected set of nearby dwarf galaxies, we present a calibrated high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) luminosity function in the low-mass galaxy regime and search for an already hinted at dependence on metallicity. Our study introduces a new sample of local dwarf galaxies (D &lt; 12.5 Mpc and M* &lt; 5 x 10^9 M_sun), expanding the specific star-formation rates (sSFR) and gas-phase metallicities probed in previous investigations. Our analysis of the observed X-ray luminosity function indicates a shallower power-law slope for the dwarf galaxy HMXB population. In our study, we focus on dwarf galaxies that are more representative in terms of sSFR compared to prior work. In this regime, the HMXB luminosity function exhibits significant stochastic sampling at high luminosities. This likely accounts for the pronounced scatter observed in the galaxy-integrated HMXB population's Lx/SFR versus metallicity for our galaxy sample. Our calibration is necessary to understand the AGN content of low mass galaxies identified in current and future X-ray survey fields and has implications for binary population synthesis models, as well as X-ray driven cosmic heating in the early universe.

  We present an intensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign of the quasar PG 1302$-$102 with Swift and the Las Cumbres Observatory network telescopes. At $z\sim0.3$, it tests the limits of the reverberation mapping (RM) technique in probing the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and extends the parameter space to high masses and high accretion rates. This is also the first time the RM technique has been applied to test disk structures predicted in the SMBH binary model that has been suggested for this source. PG 1302$-$102 was observed at a $\sim$daily cadence for $\sim 9$ months in 14 bands spanning from X-ray to UV and optical wavelengths, and it shows moderate to significant levels of variability correlated between wavelengths. We measure the inter-band time lags which are consistent with a $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ relation as expected from standard disk reprocessing, albeit with large errors. The disk size implied by the lag spectrum is consistent with the expected disk size for its black hole mass within uncertainties. While the source resembles other reverberation-mapped AGN in many respects, and we do not find evidence supporting the prevalent hypothesis that it hosts an SMBH binary, we demonstrate the feasibility of studying SMBH binaries from this novel angle and suggest possibilities for the LSST Deep Drilling Fields.   

Ejecta-circumstellar medium interaction in high-density environment to
  kilonova emission: Application for GRB 191019A

  The nearby long-duration GRB 191019A recently detected by {\em Swift} lacks an associated supernova and belongs to a host galaxy with little star formation activity, suggesting that the origin of this burst is the result of the merger of two compact objects with dynamical interactions in a high-density medium of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). By motivating of this event, it occurs in such high-density environment, the ejecta- circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction cannot be ignored to contribute a possible kilonova emission. Here, we theoretically calculate the kilonova emission by considering the contribution of the ejecta-CSM interaction in the high-density environment. We find that the contribution to the kilonova emission from the ejecta-CSM interaction will dominate at a later time, and a smaller ejecta mass will have a stronger kilonova emission from the ejecta-CSM interaction. Moreover, we try to apply it to GRB 191019A, but we find that it is difficult to identify the possible kilonova emission from the observations due to the contribution of the bright host galaxy. On the other hand, it requires a less injected mass (less than $M_{\rm ej}=2\times10^{-5}M_{\odot}$) if one can detect the kilonova emission associated with a GRB 191019A-like event in the future. The r-process-powered and spin energy contributions from the magnetar are also discussed.
