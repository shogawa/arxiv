  Radio interferometric observations of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) jets reveal the significant linear polarization of their synchrotron radiation that changes with frequency due to the Faraday rotation. It is generally assumed that such depolarization could be a powerful tool for studying the magnetized plasma in the vicinity of the jet. However, depolarization could also occur within the jet if the emitting and rotating plasma are co-spatial (i.e. the internal Faraday rotation). Burn obtained very simple dependence of the polarization on the wavelength squared for the discrete source and resolved slab that is widely used for interpreting the depolarization of AGN jets. However it ignores the influence of the non-uniform large scale magnetic field of the jet on the depolarization. Under the simple assumptions about the possible jet magnetic field structures we obtain the corresponding generalizations of Burn's relation widely used for galaxies analysis. We show that the frequency dependencies of the Faraday rotation measure and polarization angle in some cases allow to estimate the structures of the jets magnetic fields.

  10% to early black hole mass growth

  We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy-black hole scaling relations at $z=6$ to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at $z&gt;6$. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of SMBH mass at $z&gt;6$ does not take place in these UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks.   The `Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at $z&gt;6$: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor $\ge$10 smaller than the total SMBH mass volume density at $z=6$. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity, mass functions, and accretion modes, and is likely still a factor &gt;2 smaller when accounting for known obscuration fractions at this epoch.   The resulting consequences are: &gt;90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV-visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetimes for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic `high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at $z&gt;6$, possibly the JWST `Little Red Dots'. This finding might severe impact on how we will diagnose SMBH growth at $z=7$ to 15 in the future.

  Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources are compact radio galaxies (RGs), with jets extending up to 20 kpc and ages &lt;10^3 years. They are considered to have evolved into Fanaroff-Riley RGs, but the real scenario to explain the compact sources remains unsolved. The young compact jets make GPS/CSS ideal for studying feedback in the nuclear region of AGNs because the jets are just starting to leave this region. Numerical simulations and jet power estimates suggest that compact sources can drive outflows on scales several times larger than the radio source itself, but the lack of suitable data limits comparisons between theory and observation. We carried out an optical spectroscopic study of 82 CSS/GPS with SDSS-DR12 data to investigate the influence of compact jets in the gas. We found outflowing gas components in the [OIII]\lambda5007 emission lines in half of our sample. The kinetic energy of the outflowing gas in compact sources is comparable to that observed in extended RGs, indicating that the compact jets can drive powerful outflows similar to those in FR RGs. The observed anti-correlation between the kinetic power of the outflow and the radio luminosity suggests an interaction between the young jet and the interstellar medium (ISM). This finding provides significant observational support for previous simulations of jet-ISM interactions and supports the evolutionary scenario for RGs. However, the lack of sources with high kinetic efficiency indicates that some compact galaxies may be frustrated sources.

  The time lag between soft and hard X-ray photons has been observed in many active galactic nuclei (AGN) and can reveal the accretion process and geometry around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). High-frequency Fe K and soft lags are considered to originate from the light-travel distances between the corona and the accretion disk, while the propagation of the inward mass accretion fluctuation usually explains the low-frequency hard lags. Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), with a velocity range of 0.03-0.3c, have also been discovered in numerous AGN and are believed to be launched from the inner accretion disk. However, it remains unclear whether UFOs can affect the X-ray time lags. As a pilot work, we aim to investigate the potential influence of UFOs on X-ray time lags of AGN in a small sample. By performing the UFO-resolved Fourier spectral timing analysis of archival XMM-Newton observations of three AGN with transient UFOs: PG 1448+273, IRAS 13224-3809, and PG 1211+143, we compare their X-ray timing products, such as lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra, of observations with and without UFO obscuration. Our results find that in each AGN, low-frequency hard lags become weak or even disappear when they are accompanied by UFOs. In the high-frequency domain, soft lags remain unchanged while the Fe K reverberation lags tentatively disappear. The comparison between timing products of low- and high-flux observations on another three AGN without UFOs (Ark 564, NGC 7469, and Mrk 335) suggests that the disappearance of low-frequency hard lags is likely related to the emergence of UFOs, not necessarily related to the source flux. We conclude that the presence of UFOs can affect X-ray time lags of AGN by suppressing the low-frequency hard lags, which can be explained by an additional time delay introduced by UFOs or disk accretion energy carried away by UFOs.

  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact sources at $z \gtrsim 5$ known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) that are likely active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: UDS, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, Abell 2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance of the variabilities (signal-to-noise ratio or ${\rm SNR}_{\rm var}$) for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the ${\rm SNR}_{\rm var}$ distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived ${\rm SNR}_{\rm var}$ distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population on average does not show strong variability, which can be due to super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, they are dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24 - 0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical SEDs of these variable LRDs should have significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information of LRDs.

  The origin of the tight scaling relation between the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}$) and their host-galaxy properties remains unclear. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) probe phases of ongoing SMBH growth and offer the only opportunity to measure $M_{\rm BH}$ beyond the local Universe. However, determining AGN host galaxy stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_\star$, and their galaxy dynamical masses $M_{\rm dyn}$, is complicated by AGN contamination, aperture effects and different host galaxy morphologies. We select a sample of AGNs for which $M_{\rm BH}$ has been independently determined to high accuracy by state-of-the-art techniques: dynamical modeling of the reverberation signal and spatially resolving the broad-line region with VLTI/GRAVITY. Using IFU observations, we spatially map the host galaxy stellar kinematics across the galaxy and bulge effective radii. We find that that the dynamically hot component of galaxy disks correlates with $M_{\rm BH}$; however, the correlations are tightest for aperture-integrated $\sigma_\star$ measured across the bulge. Accounting for the different $M_{\rm BH}$ distributions, we demonstrate - for the first time - that AGNs follow the same $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma_\star$ and $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge, dyn}$ relations as quiescent galaxies. We confirm that the classical approach of determining the virial factor as sample-average, yielding ${\rm log }f= 0.65 \pm 0.18$, is consistent with the average $f$ from individual measurements. The similarity between the underlying scaling relations of AGNs and quiescent galaxies implies that the current AGN phase is too short to have altered BH masses on a population level. These results strengthen the local calibration of $f$ for measuring single-epoch $M_{\rm BH}$ in the distant Universe.
