The regions around massive black holes can show X-ray variability on timescales from seconds to decades. Observing many black holes over different timescales can enhance our chances of detecting variability coming from (partial) tidal disruption events, massive black hole binaries, changing state AGN, blazar activity and much more. X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes. We present the current XMM-Newton catalogues available and describe several examples of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruption sources that have been found whilst mining this data. We describe preliminary work on a search for periodic variables in the XMM-Newton EPIC archival data, with the example of finding new massive black hole binaries. We also describe the STONKS pipeline that is now in the XMM-Newton automatic reduction pipeline and the near real-time alert system that allows the follow-up of new and fading transients. We provide examples of fading sources that are newly identified candidate TDEs.

Variability studies of the broad emission lines of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and quasars show stochastic radial velocity variations (i.e., fluctuations in the centroid of the line), 'jitter', on timescales of weeks to months. This jitter may be intrinsic as the broad-line emitting region (BLR) reverberates from the AGN continuum. There are also coordinated variations in the width of the broad emission lines and the luminosity of the central source ('breathing' or 'anti-breathing') which remain unexplained. These can be used as a tool for testing models of the BLR. We have constructed a pipeline to simulate a disk-like BLR geometry that reverberates in response to various chosen continuum light curves and produce synthetic emission line profiles. These profiles can then be characterized by measured shape parameters (centroid velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and Pearson skewness coefficient) and compared to observed time series of those same parameters. We have found that through our pipeline, we can recreate the velocity jitter at similar variations found in observations. The computational tools presented in this paper will also be applicable to case studies of quasars observed under the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Black Hole Mapper reverberation mapping program. This paper is the first in a series of papers -- in this paper, we present the model and pipeline, and in future papers, we will present applications.

This study investigated the relation between the surface density of star formation rate (SFR) ($Σ_{\mathrm{SFR}}$), stellar mass ($Σ_{M_{\ast}}$), and molecular gas mass ($Σ_{M_\mathrm{mol}}$) on nearly 1 kpc scales averaged over concentric tilted rings using the $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$ mapping data of 92 nearby galaxies obtained in the CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING) project. We categorized these galaxies into three groups based on the deviation of each global SFR from the star-forming main sequence (MS), $Δ$MS: upper MS (UMS), MS, and lower MS (LMS). UMS galaxies tend to be less massive or barred spiral galaxies, exhibiting molecular gas fraction ($f_{\mathrm{gas}}$) comparable to those of MS galaxies but higher star formation efficiency (SFE). In contrast, the LMS galaxies tend to be massive or active galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Their $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ values are lower than those of MS galaxies, and their SFEs are slightly lower or comparable to those of MS galaxies in the inner region. These trends indicate that enhanced SFE contributes to higher $Δ$MS values, whereas reduced $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ results in lower $Δ$MS values. The less prominent bulge or the presence of a bar structure in UMS galaxies induces disk-wide star formation, consequently increasing the SFE. In LMS galaxies, the molecular gas is exhausted, and their star formation activity is low. Environmental effects, such as tidal gas stripping, may also reduce gas supply from the outer regions. Furthermore, our sample galaxies show that both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ decrease in the central region in LMS galaxies but did not change in the same region in UMS galaxies. These results seem to support the inside-out quenching of star formation although the dominant cause of depletion remains uncertain.

Blazars, a highly variable Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) subclass, provide a unique opportunity to explore the physical processes within their relativistic jets and emission regions. In this study, we investigate the multiwavelength variability of the blazar TON 599, a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ), with a particular emphasis on its emission line behavior. We focus on the Mg II $λ$2798 Å emission line, a key tracer of the ionized gas in the broad-line region (BLR), and its role in jet-induced variability. In addition to optical emission lines, we analyze gamma-rays (0.1-300 GeV), X-rays (0.2-10 keV), optical continuum ($λ$3000 Å), optical polarization, and millimeter-wavelength light curves. Three cross-correlation methods are employed to investigate temporal relationships between the emission line and continuum across various wavelengths. Using the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, our analysis confirms that synchrotron emission dominates the continuum during active states, highlighting the jet's primary role in the observed variability. The Mg II emission line exhibits quasi-simultaneous variability with the optical continuum, suggesting photoionization driven by the jet's non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the minimal time lag between gamma-ray and optical/near-ultraviolet emissions supports a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the most variable component of the gamma-ray emission. These findings highlight the importance of emission line variability and multiwavelength observations in constraining the interaction between jets and the BLR in blazars. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of AGN emission mechanisms and the complex interplay between jets and their surrounding environments.  

Which active galaxies might be neutrino emitters?

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has identified several individual neutrino emitters associated with supermassive black hole accretion phenomena, including blazars, tidal disruption events, and, unexpectedly, Seyfert galaxies. A key open question is which types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are most likely to be neutrino emitters. Here we show that high-confidence extragalactic neutrino emitters tend not only to have higher hard X-ray fluxes but also to be more variable in mid-infrared (MIR) than other AGNs in the \textit{Swift} BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. MIR variations effectively trace long-term fluctuations in AGN accretion disks and/or jets. In addition to the role of X-ray flux emphasized in previous studies, we speculate that long-term central engine fluctuations may also be critical for neutrino production. This hypothesis may inform IceCube neutrino-electromagnetic counterpart association studies and provide new insights into cosmic ray acceleration sites. First, the observed neutrinos are unlikely to originate from AGN host galaxies or from interactions between large-scale (dozens of parsecs) winds/outflows and the surrounding interstellar medium. Second, if neutrinos are produced in the X-ray corona, the corona should exhibit strong magnetic turbulence dissipation or magnetic reconnection whose rate changes substantially on timescales of years. Third, the relativistic jets of blazar neutrino emitters may be intrinsically unstable over years. Finally, if neutrinos are related to interactions between small-scale winds/outflows and torus clouds, such winds/outflows must be highly episodic.
