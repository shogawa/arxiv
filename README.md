  Merging black holes (BH) are expected to produce remnants with large dimensionless spin parameters ($a_{\rm spin} \sim 0.7$). However, gravitational wave (GW) observations with LIGO/Virgo suggest that merging BH are consistent with modestly positive but not high spin ($a_{\rm spin} \sim 0.2$), causing tension with models suggesting that high mass mergers are produced by hierarchical merger channels. Some BH also show evidence for strong in-plane spin components. Here we point out that \emph{spin down} of BH due to eccentric prograde post-merger orbits within the gas of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk can yield BH with masses in the upper mass gap, but only modestly positive $a_{\rm spin}$, and thus observations of BH with low spin \emph{do not} rule out hierarchical models. We also point out that the fraction of BBH mergers with significant in-plane spin components is a strong test of interactions between disk binary black holes (BBH) and nuclear spheroid orbiters. Spin magnitude and spin tilt constraints from LIGO/Virgo observations of BBH are an excellent test of dynamics of black holes in AGN disks, disk properties and the nuclear clusters interacting with AGN.

  Ly$\alpha$ emission nebulae are ubiquitous around high-z galaxies and are tracers of the gaseous environment on scales out to &gt;100 kpc. High-z radio galaxies (HzRGs, type-2 radio-loud quasars) host large scale nebulae observed in the ionised gas differ from those seen in other types of high-z quasars. In this work, we exploit MUSE observations of Lya nebulae around eight HzRGs ($2.9&lt;z&lt;4.5$). All the HzRGs have large scale Lya emission nebulae with seven of them extended over 100 kpc at the observed surface brightness (SB) limit. Because the emission line profiles are significantly affected by neutral hydrogen absorbers across the entire nebulae, we perform an absorption correction to infer maps of the intrinsic Lya SB, central velocity and velocity width, all at the last scattering surface of the observed Lya photons. We find: (i) The intrinsic SB radial profiles can be described by an inner exponential and an outter power law; (ii) our HzRGs have higher SB and more asymmetric nebulae than both RL and RQ type-1s; (iii) intrinsic nebula kinematics of four HzRGs show evidence of jet-driven outflows but no general trends for the whole sample; (iv) a relation between the nebula maximum extent and the offset between the AGN and the nebula centroids; (v) an alignment between radio jet position angles and the nebula morphology. All support a scenario where the orientation of the AGN has an impact on the observed nebular morphologies and resonant scattering may affect the shape of the SB profiles, nebular kinematics and relations between the observed Lya morphologies. Furthermore, we find evidence showing that the outskirts of the ionised gas nebulae may be 'contaminated' by Lya photons from nearby emission halos. Overall, this work provides results which allow us to compare Lya nebulae around various classes of quasars at and beyond Cosmic Noon. [Abridged]

  The Time Domain Field (TDF) near the North Ecliptic Pole in JWST's continuous-viewing zone will become a premier "blank field" for extragalactic science. JWST/NIRCam data in a 16 arcmin$^2$ portion of the TDF identify 4.4 $\mu$m counterparts for 62 of 63 3 GHz sources with S(3 GHz) &gt; 5 {\mu}Jy. The one unidentified radio source may be a lobe of a nearby Seyfert galaxy, or it may be an infrared-faint radio source. The bulk properties of the radio-host galaxies are consistent with those found by previous work: redshifts range from 0.14 to 4.4 with a median redshift of 1.33. The radio emission arises primarily from star formation in $\sim 2/3$ of the sample and from an active galactic nucleus in $\sim 1/3$, but just over half the sample shows evidence for an AGN either in the spectral energy distribution or by radio excess. All but three counterparts are brighter than magnitude 23 AB at 4.4 $\mu$m, and the exquisite resolution of JWST identifies correct counterparts for sources for which observations with lower angular resolution would mis-identify a nearby bright source as the counterpart when the correct one is faint and red. Up to 11% of counterparts might have been unidentified or misidentified absent NIRCam observations.
