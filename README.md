  What triggers AGN in some galaxies and what role does this brief period of activity play in the overall evolution of galaxies are still open questions. This paper explores whether or not the local, on scales of $\approx$1\,Mpc, galaxy density plays a role in triggering AGN when controlling for stellar mass. We consider this question as a function of redshift and AGN selection in the X-ray vs. in the IR. We use available density maps within the 4.8\,sq.deg. XMM-LSS field in the redshift range $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$. Our key result is that the environment may play a role in triggering IR AGN. In particular, at $z &gt; 1.2$ the incidence of AGN increases in higher density environments, controlling for stellar mass. However, this dependence reverses at $z &lt; 1.2$ where the incidence of IR AGN is higher in lower density environments. By contrast, among X-ray selected AGN there is no significant local density dependence. Bootstraping analysis confirms these conclusions. While these results agree with previous work on both obscured and unobscured AGN this is the first study to use a consistent methodology across IR and X-ray samples, as well as study IR dependence in this full redshift range. Upcoming large spectroscopic surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) galaxy evolution survey will be critical in further elucidating how the environment affects AGN triggering across different cosmic epochs.

  [Abridged] Optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disks around supermassive black holes are thought to contribute to broad-line emission in type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, observed emission line profiles most often deviate from those expected from a rotating disk. This report examines the role of accretion disks in broad-line emission of Population B AGN characterized by relatively low accretion rates in which broad lines show large redward asymmetry both in H$\beta$ and Mg II$\lambda$ 2800. An unbiased comparison matching black hole mass and Eddington ratio suggests that the most powerful radio-loud quasars show the highest red-ward asymmetries in H$\beta$. These shifts can be accounted for by gravitational and transverse redshift effects, especially for black hole masses larger than $\approx$10$^{8.7}$ M$_\odot$. The analysis of the extremely jetted quasar 3C 47 adds another piece to the puzzle: not only are the low ionization profiles of 3C 47 well-described by a relativistic Keplerian accretion disk model, with line emission in the range 100 - 1,000 gravitational radii, but also the high-ionization line profiles can be understood as a combination of disk plus a failed wind contribution that is in turn hiding the disk emission. Constraints on radio properties and line profile variability suggest that 3C 47 might involve the presence of a second black hole with secondary-to-primary mass ratio $\sim$ 0.5. We conjecture that the double peakers - type-1 AGN with Balmer line profiles consistent with accretion disk emission - might have their emission truncated by the sweeping effect of a second black hole. In non-starving systems, the disk signal is plausibly masked by additional line emission, rendering the disk contribution harder to detect.

  We present the optical and infrared properties of a sample of 24 radio transient sources discovered in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Previous studies of their radio emission showed that these sources resemble young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources, but are less powerful and characterized by low-power jets. The bursts of radio activity in most cases are likely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few sources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio variability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we extend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our sample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and infrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are massive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud AGNs ($\rm &gt;10^7\,M_{\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In contrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure star-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to radio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit infrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not display significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the evolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which we employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of the sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered TDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that the mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio transients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability.

  AGN jet structure and stability remain uncertain; recollimation shocks are linked to morphology and variability, but the role of downstream instabilities is still unclear. We aim to investigate how jet magnetization and other physical parameters influence the development of instabilities beyond the first recollimation shock. In particular, we focus on identifying the conditions under which the centrifugal instability (CFI) is effective. We perform high-resolution 2D and 3D simulations using the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code PLUTO. The jets are initialized with a conical geometry and propagate into an ambient medium, and we follow by axisymmetric simulations how they evolve towards a steady-state. In 2D we explore a range of magnetizations (from 0 to 1), pressure contrasts, and inertia ratios to characterize the formation and evolution of recollimation shocks. The results are further evaluated using linear stability analysis to assess the growth and suppression of CFI. Finally, we perform 3D simulations of unstable and stable jets. We discuss how the different parameters of the axisymmetric steady solutions influence the location and strength of recollimation. We find that, even in moderately magnetized jets, $\sigma$=0.1, the CFI can still develop under suitable local conditions and disrupt the jet structure. This instability is governed by the jet radius, curvature, Lorentz factor, and magnetization, and is not always predictable from injection conditions. While magnetization can delay or locally suppress instability growth, it does not guarantee long-term jet stability. Our 3D results highlight the limitations of 2D models in capturing non-axisymmetric and nonlinear effects, and underline the complex interplay between magnetic confinement and destabilizing mechanisms. These findings have implications for interpreting variability, and polarization structure in AGN jets.

  Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.

  We investigate the spatial relationships between multi-phase gas components and supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity in a sample of 25 cool core galaxy groups and clusters. Using high angular resolution observations from \textit{Chandra}, VLT/MUSE, and VLBA, we robustly locate the position, respectively, of the X-ray peak of the intracluster medium (ICM), of the H$\alpha$ peak of the warm ionized gas, and of the SMBH radio core on parsec scales. We identify spatial offsets between the X-ray peak of the hot gas and the SMBH in 80% of the systems, with an average displacement of $\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{X-ray}}\rangle = 4.8$ kpc (dispersion of $3.8$ kpc). In contrast, the peak of warm ionized gas traced by H$\alpha$ exhibits much smaller offsets ($\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{H}\alpha}\rangle = 0.6$ kpc; dispersion of $1.4$ kpc) and a lower incidence of displacement (15%). Our findings suggest that hot gas sloshing primarily drives the observed spatial offsets, with AGN-driven uplift contributing in some systems.Importantly, systems with H$\alpha$ - SMBH offsets of $\geq$1 kpc uniformly lack detectable radio cores on VLBA scales, with upper limits on the 5~GHz power of $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \leq 10^{21-22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, while those without such offsets exhibit radio powerful AGN with pc-scale radio emission up to $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \sim 10^{24-25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. This correlation indicates that centrally concentrated warm gas is critical for sustaining radio-loud SMBH activity, possibly supporting scenarios of cold-mode accretion. Overall, our results highlight the importance of high-angular-resolution, multi-wavelength observations for understanding the interplay between multiphase gas cooling and AGN fueling in central galaxies.

  From the luminous quasars at $z \sim 6$ to the recent $z \sim 9-11$ AGNs revealed by JWST, observations of the earliest black hole (BH) populations can provide unique constraints on BH formation and growth models. We use the BRAHMA simulations with constrained initial conditions to investigate BH assembly in extreme overdense regions. The simulations implement heavy seeds ($\sim 10^4-10^5 M_{\odot})$ forming in dense, metal-poor gas exposed to sufficient Lyman-Werner flux. With gas accretion modeled via Bondi-Hoyle formalism and BH dynamics and mergers using a subgrid dynamical friction scheme, we isolate the impact of seeding, dynamics, accretion, and feedback on early BH growth. With fiducial stellar and AGN feedback inherited from IllustrisTNG, accretion is strongly suppressed at $z \gtrsim 9$, leaving mergers as the dominant growth channel. Gas accretion dominates at $z \lesssim 9$, where permissive models (super-Eddington or low radiative efficiency) build $\sim 10^9\ M_{\odot}$ BHs powering quasars by $z \sim 6$, while stricter IllustrisTNG-based prescriptions yield much lower BH masses ($\sim 10^6-10^8\ M_{\odot}$). Our seed models strongly affect merger-driven growth at $z \gtrsim 9$: only the most lenient models (with $\sim 10^5\ M_{\odot}$ seeds) produce enough BH mergers to reach $\gtrsim 10^6\ M_{\odot}$ by $z \sim 10$, consistent with current estimates for GN-z11. Our dynamical friction model gives low merger efficiencies, hindering the buildup of $\gtrsim 10^7\ M_{\odot}$ BHs by $z \sim 9-10$, as currently inferred for GHZ9, UHZ1, and CAPERS-LRD-z9. If the BH-to-stellar mass ratios of these sources are indeed as extreme as currently inferred, they would require either very short BH merger timescales or reduced AGN thermal feedback. Weaker stellar feedback boosts both star formation and BH accretion and cannot raise these ratios.

  Galactic winds play a critical role in galaxy evolution, yet their structure and driving mechanisms remain poorly understood, especially in low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) systems. NGC 1266 hosts one such LLAGN, embedded in a massive molecular gas reservoir that is not forming stars, likely due to AGN feedback. We analyze deep archival \textit{Chandra} data to constrain the properties of its hot gas and compare them to other wind systems. We find temperatures of $0.24$--$1.85$ keV and notably high electron densities of $0.33$--$4.2$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting significant mass loading, further supported by charge exchange emission in the southern lobe, one of the few AGN systems where it has been detected. We measure pressures and thermal energies of $10^6$--$10^8$~K cm$^{-3}$ and $10^{54}$--$10^{56}$ erg, exceeding the minimum energy needed for the radio jet to power the outflow and implying the hot phase comprises a large fraction of the energy budget. Archival MUSE data reveal a cavity-like feature in the southern outflow, potentially associated with the far side of the outflow cone. At the maximum outflow extent, the warm and hot phases appear to be in pressure equilibrium. Coupled with short cooling timescales of $\sim$1 Myr, comparable to the advection time, this suggests the outflow is undergoing radiative cooling and may have stalled. Finally, we compare NGC 1266 to other local AGN and starburst galaxies, finding NGC 1266 to be the densest wind in the sample.

  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that were originally classified as sources with little to no radio emission. Although the class is rather unified from an optical perspective, their radio characteristics are diverse. One of the biggest curiosities found in these sources is their ability to form and maintain powerful relativistic jets. We studied the radio properties of a sample of 3998 NLS1 galaxies which is the largest clean sample available, thus allowing us to study the population-wide characteristics. We used both historical and ongoing surveys: the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS; 144~MHz), the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST; 1.4~GHz), the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS; 1.4~GHz), and the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; 3~GHz). We were able to obtain a radio detection for $\sim40\%$ of our sources, with the most detections by LoTSS. The majority of the detected NLS1 galaxies are faint ($\sim1-2$ mJy) and non-variable, suggesting considerable contributions from star formation activities, especially at 144~MHz. However, we identified samples of extreme sources, for example, in fractional variability and radio luminosity, indicating significant AGN activity. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the NLS1 galaxy population in radio and lays the foundation for targeted future studies.   

Quasar Main Sequence unfolded by 2.5D FRADO (Natural expression of

  The quasar main sequence (QMS), characterized by the Eigenvector 1 (EV1), serves as a unifying framework for classifying type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on their diverse spectral properties. Although a fully self-consistent physical interpretation has long been lacking, our physically motivated 2.5D FRADO (Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow) model naturally predicts that the Eddington ratio ($\dot{m}$) is the primary physical driver of the QMS, with black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and inclination ($i$) acting as secondary contributors. We employed a dense grid of FRADO simulations of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR), covering a representative range of $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}$. For each simulation, we computed the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\beta$ line under different $i$. The resulting FWHM--$\dot{m}$ diagram closely resembles the characteristic trend observed in the EV1 parameter space. This establishes the role of $\dot{m}$ as the true proxy for the Fe II strength parameter ($R_{\rm Fe}$), and vice versa. Our results suggest that $\dot{m}$ can be regarded as the sole underlying physical tracer of $R_{\rm Fe}$ and should therefore scale directly with it. The $M_{\rm BH}$ accounts for the virial mass-related scatter in FWHM, while $i$ acts as a secondary driver modulating $R_{\rm Fe}$ and FWHM for a given $\dot{m}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$.

  Using deep observations across three of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields, this work measures the angular clustering of star forming galaxies (SFGs) and low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) to $z$$\lesssim$1.5 for faint sources, $S_{\textrm{144 MHz}}$$\geq$200 $\mu$Jy. We measure the angular auto-correlation of LOFAR sources in redshift bins and their cross-correlation with multi-wavelength sources {to} measure the evolving galaxy bias for SFGs and LERGs. Our work shows the bias of the radio-selected SFGs increases from $b=0.90^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ at $z \sim 0.2$ to $b = 2.94^{+0.36}_{-0.36}$ at $z \sim 1.2$; faster than the assumed $b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$ models adopted in previous LOFAR cosmology studies (at sensitivities where AGN dominate), but in broad agreement with previous work. We further study the luminosity dependence of bias for SFGs and find little evidence for any luminosity dependence at fixed redshift, although uncertainties remain large for the sample sizes available. The LERG population instead shows a weaker redshift evolution with $b=2.33^{+0.28}_{-0.27}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b=2.65^{+0.57}_{-0.55}$ at $z \sim 1.2$, though it is also consistent with the assumed bias evolution model ($b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$) within the measured uncertainties. For those LERGs which reside in quiescent galaxies (QLERGs), there is weak evidence that they are more biased than the general LERG population and evolve from $b = 2.62^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b = 3.08^{+0.85}_{-0.84}$ at $z \sim 1.2$. This suggests the halo environment of radio sources may be related to their properties. These measurements can help constrain models for the bias evolution of these source populations, and can help inform multi-tracer analyses.

  Radio synchrotron emission originates from both massive star formation and black hole accretion, two processes that drive galaxy evolution. Efficient classification of sources dominated by either process is therefore essential for fully exploiting deep, wide-field extragalactic radio continuum surveys. In this study, we implement, optimize, and compare five widely used supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithms to classify radio sources detected in the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE)-COSMOS survey as star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Training and test sets are constructed from conventionally classified MIGHTEE-COSMOS sources, and 18 physical parameters of the MIGHTEE-detected sources are evaluated as input features. As anticipated, our feature analyses rank the five parameters used in conventional classification as the most effective: the infrared-radio correlation parameter ($q_\mathrm{IR}$), the optical compactness morphology parameter (class$\_$star), stellar mass, and two combined mid-infrared colors. By optimizing the ML models with these selected features and testing classifiers across various feature combinations, we find that model performance generally improves as additional features are incorporated. Overall, all five algorithms yield an $F1$-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) $&gt;90\%$ even when trained on only $20\%$ of the dataset. Among them, the distance-based $k$-nearest neighbors classifier demonstrates the highest accuracy and stability, establishing it as a robust and effective method for classifying SFGs and AGN in upcoming large radio continuum surveys.

  Non-jetted AGN exhibit hard X-ray emission with a power law spectrum above $\sim$2 keV, which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons (pairs) in the vicinity of the black hole. The origin and composition of this plasma source, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. Our study focuses on the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets in the neutrino production of AGN coronae. We present a model that has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. Furthermore, we combine our coronal model with an AGN population in order to provide a prediction for the diffuse neutrino flux measured on Earth. We compare our results with the observational data by IceCube and we find a satisfactory agreement on both the flux value and the slope of the neutrino distribution when we assume a $\sigma_{\rm p}$ value of $10^5$ for all the sources in our sample.

  Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution radio intensity maps, crucial for detailed studies of compact sources like active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their relativistic jets. Analyzing jet components in these maps traditionally involves manual Gaussian fitting, a time-consuming bottleneck for large datasets. To address this, we present an automated batch-processing tool, based on the Gaussian fitting capabilities of CASA, designed to streamline VLBI jet component characterization (AAP-Imfit). Our algorithm sets a detection limit, performs automatic 2D Gaussian fitting, and removes model artifacts, efficiently extracting component flux densities and positions. This method enables systematic and reproducible analysis, significantly reducing the time required for fitting extensive VLBI datasets. We validated AAP-Imfit by using VLBI observations of the blazars 3C 279 and 3C 454.3, comparing our results with published fits. The close agreement in residual root mean square (RMS) values and model/residual-to-map RMS ratios confirms the accuracy of our automated approach in reproducing original flux distributions. While visual inspection remains important for complex or faint features, this routine significantly accelerates VLBI component fitting, paving the way for large-scale statistical studies of jet dynamics.

  One of the most puzzling properties of the high-redshift AGN population recently discovered by JWST, including both broad-line and narrow-line sources, is their X-ray weakness. With very few exceptions, and regardless of the optical classification, they are undetected at the limits of the deepest Chandra fields, even when stacking signals from tens of sources in standard observed-frame energy intervals (soft, hard, and full bands). It has been proposed that their elusive nature in the X-ray band is due to heavy absorption by dust-free gas or intrinsic weakness, possibly due to high, super-Eddington accretion. In this work, we perform X-ray stacking in three customized rest-frame energy ranges (1-4, 4-7.25, and 10-30 keV) of a sample of 50 Type 1 and 38 Type 2 AGN identified by JWST in the CDFS and CDFN fields. For the Type 2 sub-sample, we reach a total of about 210 Ms exposure, and we report a significant ($\sim 3\sigma$) detection in the hardest (10-30 keV rest frame) band, along with relatively tight upper limits in the rest frame softer energy bands. The most straightforward interpretation is in terms of heavy obscuration due to gas column densities well within the Compton thick regime ($&gt; 2 \times 10^{24} $cm$^{-2}$) with a large covering factor, approaching 4$\pi$. The same procedure applied to the Type 1 sub-sample returns no evidence for a significant signal in about 140 Ms stacked data in any of the adopted bands, confirming their surprisingly elusive nature in the X-ray band obtained with previous stacking experiments. A brief comparison with the current observations and the implications for the evolution of AGN are discussed.

  We present the deepest medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to date of a bright Little Red Dot (LRD) AGN, Irony at z=6.68. The data reveal broad Balmer emission from H$\alpha$-H$\delta$ and Balmer absorption in H$\alpha$-H$\epsilon$. The absorption lines are kinematically split: H$\alpha$ is blueshifted while higher-order lines are redshifted suggesting complex gas kinematics; their relative ratios are inconsistent with a single, passive absorbing screen. The line depths require absorption of both the BLR and the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin, consistent with the smooth Balmer break. We fit the broad H$\gamma$-H$\alpha$ lines and find the data favor a double-Gaussian effective profile, although exponential wings are evident. Depending on the adopted profile, single-epoch virial estimates give log(M$_\bullet$/M$_\odot$)=7.86-8.39 and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$=1.7-0.4. The dynamical mass implied by the narrow lines is low log(Mdyn/M$_\odot$)=9.1, suggesting an overmassive black hole. The narrow lines display little attenuation, A$_V&lt;0.5$ mag; while broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta\sim9$ and the broad Balmer decrements are inconsistent with standard dust attenuation curves, suggesting collisional processes. The forbidden-line spectrum includes auroral [S II] and [N II], and a forest of [Fe II] lines. Line ratios and kinematics indicate a stratified narrow-line region with both low (n$_{\rm e}$=420 cm$^{-3}$) and high densities (n$_{\rm e}\gtrsim 6.3\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$). We detect metal absorption lines in both the optical (Ca II and Na I) and UV range (Fe II UV1-UV3). Our results support a picture of a compact AGN embedded in a dense, high covering-factor and stratified cocoon, with complex neutral-gas kinematics. While the choice of broad-line profile affects the virial estimates of M$_\bullet$, we find the effect to be of order 0.6 dex between the different approaches.
