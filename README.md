  We use Faraday rotation measurements from the latest catalog LoTSS DR2 from LOFAR to probe intergalactic magnetic fields. To identify the extragalactic component of the observed rotation measure (RM) we use two different techniques: residual rotation measure (RRM) and close radio pairs. For the RRM approach, we conclude that, despite smaller measurement errors in the LOFAR data, robust and conservative treatment of the systematic uncertainties in the Galactic contribution to RM results in the constraint on a homogeneous volume-filling magnetic field at the level 2.4 nG, slightly weaker than previous constraints from NVSS data, and does not allow to probe the presence of over-magnetized bubbles predicted by the AGN feedback model of the IllustrisTNG. Analyzing close radio pairs we found that in only 0.5% of our mock realizations of observed data, the expected contribution from the over-magnetized bubbles does not exceed LoTSS DR2 data.

  Within the mass range of $10^{16}-5\times 10^{18}$ g, primordial black holes (PBHs) persist as plausible candidates for dark matter. Our study involves a reassessment of the constraints on PBHs through a comparative analysis of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and the emissions arising from their Hawking evaporation. We identify previously overlooked radiation processes across the relevant energy bands, potentially refining the bounds on PBHs. These processes encompass the direct emission from Hawking radiation, in-flight annihilation, the final state of radiation, and positronium annihilation. Thorough consideration is given to all these processes and their respective emission fractions, followed by a precise calculation of the $\mathcal{D}$ factor for observations directed towards the high-latitude Galactic contribution. Furthermore, we integrate the flux originating from extragalactic sources, both of which contribute to the measured isotropic flux. Through a comparative analysis of data derived from previous CXB observations utilizing an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) double power-law model, we establish the most stringent constraints for PBHs, thereby excluding the possibility of PBHs constituting the entire dark matter mass within the range of $2.5\times 10^{17}-3 \times 10^{17} $g.

  We investigate the dynamics of GN-z11, a luminous galaxy at $z=10.60$, carefully analyzing the public deep integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data taken with JWST NIRSpec IFU. While the observations of the IFS data originally targeted a He II clump near GN-z11, we find that C III]$\lambda\lambda1907,1909$ emission from ionized gas at GN-z11 is bright and spatially extended significantly beyond the point-spread function (PSF) in contrast with the GN-z11's compact UV-continuum morphology. The spatially extended C III] emission of GN-z11 shows a velocity gradient, red- and blue-shifted components in the NE and SW directions, respectively, which cannot be explained by the variation of [C III]$\lambda$1907/C III]$\lambda$1909 line ratios. We perform forward modeling with GalPak$^\mathrm{3D}$, including the effects of PSF smearing and line blending, and find that the best-fit model is a nearly edge-on disk with a rotation velocity of $v_\mathrm{rot}$=$376_{-151}^{+110}$ km s$^{-1}$, a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=113_{-48}^{+24}$ km s$^{-1}$, and a ratio of $v_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma_v=3.3_{-1.5}^{+1.7}$, indicative of a rotation-dominated disk at $z=10.6$. Interestingly, the disk rotation velocity is faster than the circular velocity at the virial radius, $v_\mathrm{c}(r_{200})=205_{-34}^{+28}$ km s$^{-1}$, estimated from the stellar mass, suggesting a compact disk produced under weak feedback such predicted in numerical simulations. In fact, the half-light radius of the C III] emitting gas disk is only $294\pm45$ pc, while the one of the stellar UV component is even smaller, $196\pm12$ pc. While higher S/N data are necessary for a conclusion, these observational results would suggest that GN-z11 has a fast-rotating gaseous disk whose center possesses luminous stellar components or AGN providing weak feedback.

  The spectral energy distribution (SED) of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN) presents unique challenges due to their comparable radiation output to their host galaxies and complex accretion dynamics. We introduce a novel module within the CIGALE framework specifically designed for SED fitting of LLAGN, incorporating both empirical relationships like $L_\mathrm{X}$--$L_\mathrm{12\mu m}$ and physically-based accretion models such as advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and truncated accretion disks. This allows for more accurate depiction of LLAGN central emissions.   Using this module, we analyzed a set of 52 X-ray-detected local galaxies, primarily LINERs and Seyferts, and compared its performance to higher-luminosity AGN from the COSMOS and SDSS datasets. Our results show that the module adeptly estimates bolometric luminosities with high precision, despite significant galaxy contamination. It also introduces a versatile X-ray bolometric correction formula covering a vast range of luminosities.   Further, our study explored the $\alpha_\mathrm{ox}$ index, which measures the UV to X-ray emission slope, showing that unlike quasars, LLAGN display either stable or only slightly varying $\alpha_\mathrm{ox}$ values, indicating differing accretion and photon production processes in the low luminosity regime. Additionally, we observed a significant drop of 1.4 dex in specific star formation rates when moving from whole galaxies to a central 9-arcsecond aperture in LLAGN, suggesting potential feedback mechanisms at play.   Overall, our findings underscore the importance of a multiwavelength approach in AGN studies, highlighting distinct behaviors of LLAGN compared to quasars, thus enhancing our understanding of LLAGN and providing a framework for future comprehensive AGN population studies.

  Context : Understanding the mechanisms that launch and shape powerful relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies over cosmic time.   Aims :We study the high-redshift ($z=3.396$) blazar OH~471 to explore the jet launching mechanism in the early Universe.   Methods : Using multi-frequency radio monitoring observations and high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging over three decades, we study the milliarcsecond structure and long-term variability of OH~471.   Results : Spectral modelling of the radio flux densities reveals a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum indicating strong magnetic fields within the compact core. By applying the flux freezing approximation, we estimate the magnetic flux carried by the jet and find that it reaches or exceeds theoretical predictions for jets powered by black hole spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This implies that OH~471 was in a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the magnetic flux accumulated near the horizon regulates the accretion flow, allowing efficient extraction of black hole rotational energy.   Conclusions : Our study demonstrates the dominance of MAD accretion in powering the prominent radio flares and relativistic jets observed in the radio-loud AGN OH~471 and statistical studies of large samples of high-redshift AGN will shed light on the role of MAD accretion in launching and accelerating the earliest relativistic jets.
