  The detection of blue-shifted absorption lines likely associated with ionized Iron K-shell transitions in the X-ray spectra of many Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) suggests the presence of a highly ionized gas outflowing with mildly relativistic velocities (0.03c-0.6c), named Ultra-Fast Outflow (UFO). Within the SUBWAYS project we characterized these winds starting from a sample of 22 radio-quiet quasars at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.4, and compared the results with similar studies in the literature on samples of 42 local radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies and 14 high redshift radio-quiet quasars. The scope of our work is a statistical study of UFO parameters and incidence, considering key physical properties of the sources, e.g. supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, bolometric luminosity, accretion rates and Spectral Energy Distribution, with the aim of gaining new insights into the UFO launching mechanisms. We find indications that highly luminous AGN with steeper X-ray/UV ratio, are more likely to host UFO. The presence of UFO is not significantly related to any other AGN property in our sample. These findings suggest that the UFO phenomenon may be transient. Focusing on AGN with UFO, other important results are: (1) faster UFO have larger ionization parameters and column densities; (2) X-ray radiation plays a more crucial role in driving highly ionized winds compared to UV; (3) the correlation between outflow velocity and luminosity is significantly flatter than what expected for radiatively driven winds; (4) more massive BH experience higher wind mass-losses, suppressing accretion of matter onto the BH; (5) the UFO launching radius is positively correlated with the Eddington ratio. Furthermore, our analysis suggest the involvement of multiple launching mechanisms, including radiation pressure and magneto-hydrodynamic processes, rather than pointing to a single, universally applicable mechanism.

  Merging of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) could take place within the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The resulting BH remnant is likely to accrete the disk gas at a super-Eddington rate, launching a fast, quasi-spherical outflow (wind). Particles will be accelerated by shocks driven by the wind, subsequently interacting with the shocked disk gas or radiation field through hadronic processes and resulting in the production of high-energy neutrinos and potential electromagnetic (EM) emissions. This study delves into the intricate evolution of the shock driven by the remnant BH wind within AGN disks. Subsequently, we calculated the production of neutrinos and the expected detection numbers for a single event, along with their contributions to the overall diffuse neutrino background. Our analysis, considering various scenarios, reveals considerable neutrino production and possible detection by IceCube for nearby events. The contribution of the remnant BH winds on the diffuse neutrino background is minor due to the low event rate density, but it can be improved to some extent for some optimistic parameters. We also propose that there could be two neutrino/EM bursts, one originating from the premerger BBH wind and the other from the remnant BH wind, with the latter typically having a time gap to the GW event of around tens of days. When combined with the anticipated gravitational waves (GW) emitted during the BBH merger, such a system emerges as a promising candidate for joint observations involving neutrinos, GWs, and EM signals.

  We identify a fading AGN SDSS J220141.64+115124.3 from the internal Product Launch-11 (MPL-11) in Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. The central region with a projected radius of $\sim$2.4 kpc is characterized as LINER-like line ratios while the outskirts extended to $\sim$15 kpc show Seyfert-like line ratios. The [OIII]$\lambda$5007 luminosity of the Seyfert regions is a factor of 37 (2) higher than the LINER regions without (with) dust attenuation correction, suggesting that the AGN activity decreases at least $\sim$8 $\times$ 10$^3$ yrs ($\sim$2.4 kpc/light-speed) ago. We model the emission line spectra in the central region with double Gaussian components (a narrow core and a broad wing) and analyze the properties of each component. The narrow core component mostly co-rotates with the stellar disc, whereas the broad wing component with a median of the velocity dispersion $\sim$300 km s$^{-1}$ is related to a wind outflow. The kinematic position angle (PA) of the ionized gas shows a $\sim$20{\deg} twist from the galaxy center to 1.5 effective radius. The median of the PA difference between the gas and stellar components is as large as $\sim$50{\deg} within 0.4 effective radius. The tidal feature in DESI image and star-gas misalignment suggest this galaxy is a merger remnant. Combining all these observational results as well as public available X-ray and MIR luminosities, we confirm this is a fading AGN, the merger process kick-started the central engine to quasar phase which ionized gas composed of tidal debris, and now the activity of the central black hole decreases. The discontinuity in [OIII]$\lambda$5007 flux and EQW maps is due to multiple AGN outbursts triggered by merger remnant gas inflows.

  We examine the fundamental plane of 91 Blazars which include FSRQs and BL Lacs with known X-ray luminosity ($L_{R}$), radio luminosity ($L_X$), and black hole mass measurements ($M$) to reflect the relationship between jet and accretion for blazars. The fundamental plane of Blazars are log$L_{R}$=${0.273}_{+0.059}^{-0.059}$log$L_X$+${0.695}_{+0.191}^{-0.191}$log$M$+${25.457}_{+2.728}^{-2.728}$ and log$L_{R}$=${0.190}_{+0.049}^{-0.049}$log$L_X$+${0.475}_{+0.157}^{-0.157}$log$M$+${28.568}_{+2.245}^{-2.245}$ after considering the effect of beam factor. Our results suggest that the jet of blazars has connection with accretion. We set the black hole spin energy as a new variable to correct the black hole mass and explore the effect of black hole spin on the fundamental relationship. We find that the fundamental plane of Blazars is effected by the black hole spin, which is similar to the previous work for AGNs. We additionally examine a new fundamental plane which is based on the black hole spin-mass energy ($M_{spin}$). The new fundamental plane (log$L_{R}$=${0.332}_{+0.081}^{-0.081}$log$L_X$+${0.502}_{+0.091}^{-0.091}$log$M_{spin}$+${22.606}_{+3.346}^{-3.346}$ with R-Square=0.575) shows that $M_{spin}$ has a better correlation coefficient comparing to the $M$ for fundamental plane of Blazars. These results support that the black hole spin should be considered as a important factor for the study of fundamental plane for Blazars. And these may further our understanding of the Blandford-Znajek process in blazars.

  The ultra luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) F13451+1232 is an excellent example of a galaxy merger in the early stages of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, a phase in which AGN-driven outflows are expected to be particularly important. However, previous observations have determined that the mass outflow rates of the warm ionised and neutral gas phases in F13451+1232 are relatively modest, and there has been no robust detection of molecular outflows. Using high spatial resolution ALMA CO(1-0) observations, we detect a kiloparsec-scale circumnuclear disk, as well as extended ($r\sim440$ pc), intermediate-velocity (300&lt;|$v$|&lt;400 km s$^{-1}$) cold molecular gas emission that cannot be explained by rotational disk motions. If interpreted as AGN-driven outflows, the mass outflow rates associated with this intermediate-velocity gas are relatively modest ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{out}=22$-$27$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$); however, we also detect a compact ($r_\mathrm{out}$&lt;120 pc), high velocity (400&lt;$v$&lt;680 km s$^{-1}$) cold molecular outflow near the primary nucleus of F13451+1232, which carries an order of magnitude more mass ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{out}\sim230$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) than (and several times the kinetic power of) the previously-detected warmer phases. Moreover, the similar spatial scales of this compact outflow and the radio structure indicate that it is likely accelerated by the small-scale ($r\sim130$ pc) AGN jet in the primary nucleus of F13451+1232. Considering the compactness of the nuclear outflow and intermediate-velocity non-rotating gas that we detect, we argue that high spatial-resolution observations are necessary to properly quantify the properties of AGN-driven outflows and their impacts on host galaxies.
