  Context. The soft excess, a surplus of X-ray photons above 2 keV with respect to a power law, is a feature of debated physical origin found in the X-ray spectra of many type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). The eROSITA instrument aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission will provide an all-sky census of AGN suitable for spectral analysis. Aims. The primary goal of this work is to test a variety of models for the soft X-ray emission of AGN (thermal emission, non-thermal emission, ionised absorption, or neutral partial covering absorption) to help identify the physical origin of the soft X-ray spectral complexity. Differences between these models are examined in the context of this sample to understand the physical properties. Methods. We used Bayesian X-ray analysis to fit a sample of 200 AGN from the eFEDS hard X-ray--selected sample with a variety of phenomenological and physically motivated models. Model selection was performed using the Bayes factor to compare the applicability of each model. Results. We find that 29 sources have evidence for a soft excess at a confidence level &gt;97.5%, all of which are better modelled by an additional soft power law than by thermal blackbody emission. We find 23 of these sources prefer a warm corona model, while six sources prefer relativistic blurred reflection. Additionally many sources show evidence for complex absorption, with 29 preferring a warm absorber and 25 a partial covering absorber. Sources with a soft excess show a significantly higher Eddington ratio than those with warm absorbers. We discuss the implication of these results for the physical processes in the central regions of AGN. Conclusions. Spectral fitting with Bayesian statistics is ideal for the identification of complex absorption and soft excesses in the X-ray spectra of AGN and can allow one to distinguish between different physical interpretations.

  Finding the first generation of stars formed out of pristine gas in the early Universe, known as Population III (PopIII) stars, is one of the most important goals of modern astrophysics. Recent models suggest that PopIII stars may form in pockets of pristine gas in the halo of more evolved galaxies. Here we present NIRSpec-IFU and NIRSpec-MSA observations of the region around GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at $z=10.6$, which reveal a $&gt;$5$\sigma$ detection of a feature consistent with being HeII$\lambda$1640 emission at the redshift of GN-z11. The very high equivalent width of the putative HeII emission in this clump (170 A), and the lack of metal lines, can be explained in terms of photoionisation by PopIII stars, while photoionisation by PopII stars is inconsistent with the data. It would also indicate that the putative PopIII stars likely have a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), with an upper cutoff reaching at least 500 M$_\odot$. The PopIII bolometric luminosity inferred from the HeII line would be $\sim 2\times 10^{10}~L_\odot$, which (with a top-heavy IMF) would imply a total stellar mass formed in the burst of $\sim 6\times 10^{5}~M_\odot$. We find that photoionisation by the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in GN-z11 cannot account for the HeII luminosity observed in the clump, but can potentially be responsible for additional HeII emission observed closer to GN-z11. We also consider the possibility of in-situ photoionisation by an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH) hosted by the HeII clump; we find that this scenario is less favoured, but it remains a possible alternative interpretation. We also report the detection of a Ly$\alpha$ halo stemming out of GN-z11 and extending out to $\sim$2 kpc, as well as resolved, funnel-shaped CIII] emission, likely tracing the ionisation cone of the AGN.

  We analyze the broad H$\beta$ line profile variability of the "changing look" active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) NGC 3516 over a long period of 25 years. The observed change in the broad line profile may indicate a change in the geometry of the broad line region (BLR). Using spectral line profiles, we aim to explore changes in the kinematics and dimensions of the BLR in NGC 3516. We consider two possible scenarios, i.e. changes in the broad-line emission are caused by a decrease of ionization continuum emission or by the BLR obscuration by outer dusty regions. With this investigation we aim to clarify the CL mechanism of this AGN. We analyze the spectral band around the H$\beta$ line as well as the broad H$\beta$ line parameters, and how they change in time. We model the broad-line profiles assuming that there is an emission from the accretion disc superposed with an emission from a surrounding region that is outside the disc. We find that in the Type 1 activity phase, the BLR is very complex. There is a clear disc-like BLR that contributes to the broad line wings and an additional intermediate line region (ILR) that contributes to the line core. In the high activity phase, the ILR emission is close to the center of the line (in some cases slightly shifted to the red), whereas in the low activity phase (i.e., Type 2 phase), the ILR component has a significant shift to the blue, indicating an outflow. We propose that the changing look mechanism in NGC 3516 is rather connected with the intrinsic effects than with an outer obscuring region. It may still be possible that the dust has an important role in the low activity phase when it is coming inside of the BLR, making a dusty BLR. In this way, it causes a decrease in the ionization and recombination rates.   

Life after AGN switchoff: evolution and properties of fossil galactic
  outflows

  Galaxy-wide outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are an important ingredient in galaxy evolution. Analytical calculations suggest that such outflows have significant inertia and can persist long after the AGN itself fades away. We use hydrodynamical simulations of outflows in idealised galaxy bulges to investigate the propagation of these `fossil' AGN outflows. We find that fossil outflows should be common in gas-poor galaxies but form only rarely in gas-rich ones; in general, fossil outflows should outnumber driven ones by a factor of a few in the local Universe, and possibly more at high redshift. When they do form, fossil outflows tend to be lopsided and detached from the nucleus, and colder than their driven counterparts, with a more prominent molecular phase. Spatially resolved and/or multiphase observations can help distinguish fossil AGN outflows from star formation-driven ones, which have similar integrated properties. We discuss a number of spatially-resolved observations of outflows, suggesting that most show evidence of fossil outflow existence, sometimes together with driven outflows on smaller scales.

  We have performed CO J =1-0 observations of ten galaxies hosting luminous ($L_{\rm bol} &gt; 10^{46}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope. The targets are selected because they are expected to be rich in molecular gas based on their high nebular dust extinction ($A_{\rm V}$). However, no significant CO emission lines were detected in any of the targets. The upper limits of the CO J=1-0 luminosities are lower than expected given the molecular gas mass inferred from the nebular $A_{\rm V}$. This inconsistency may be due to overestimated $A_{\rm V}$ values due to the lack of stellar absorption correction. Considering more reliable $A_{\rm V}$ values, the CO J=1-0 non-detections by Nobeyama 45-m are natural. This suggests that our results do not contradict the conversion methods from $A_{\rm V}$ to molecular gas mass proposed in the literature. This survey suggests that careful $A_{\rm V}$ measurements as well as CO observations are still needed to improve the measurements or estimates of the molecular gas content of galaxies hosting luminous AGNs.

  We report the discovery of a candidate dual QSO at z=1.889, a redshift that is in the era known as "cosmic noon" where most of the Universe's black hole and stellar mass growth occurred. The source was identified in Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR images of a dust-reddened QSO that showed two closely-separated point sources at a projected distance of 0.26", or 2.2 kpc. This red QSO was targeted for imaging to explore whether red QSOs are hosted by merging galaxies. We subsequently obtained a spatially-resolved STIS spectrum of the system, covering the visible spectral range, and verifying the presence of two distinct QSO components. We also obtained high-resolution radio continuum observations with the VLBA at 1.4 GHz (21-cm L band) and found two sources coincident with the optical positions. The sources have similar black hole masses, bolometric luminosities, and radio loudness parameters. However, their colors and reddenings differ significantly. The redder QSO has a higher Eddington ratio, consistent with previous findings. We consider the possibility of gravitational lensing and and find that it would require extreme and unlikely conditions. If confirmed as a bona-fide dual QSO, this system would link dust-reddening to galaxy and supermassive black hole mergers, opening up a new population in which to search for samples of dual AGN.   

Interpretation of IR variability of AGNs in the hollow bi-conical dust
  outflow model

  We show that, contrary to simple predictions, most AGNs show at best only a small increase of lags with increasing wavelength in the J, H, K, and L bands . We suggest that a possible cause of this near simultaneity of the variability from the near-IR to the mid-IR is that the hot dust is in a hollow bi-conical outflow of which we preferentially see the near side. In the proposed model sublimation or re-creation of dust (with some delay relative luminosity variations) along our line of sight in the hollow cone could be a factor in explaining the changing look phenomenon of AGNs. Variations in the dust obscuration can help explain changes in relationship of H-beta time delay on Luv variability. The relative wavelength independence of IR lags simplifies the use of IR lags for estimating cosmological parameters.
