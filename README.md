  We analyzed MUSE observations of 42 local $z&lt;0.1$ type 1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies taken from the Palomar-Green quasar sample and the close AGN reference survey. Our goal was to study the relation between the black hole mass ($M_\bullet$) and bulge stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_e$) for type 1 active galaxies. The sample spans black hole masses of $10^{6.0}-10^{9.2}\,M_\odot$, bolometric luminosities of $10^{42.9}-10^{46.0}\,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, and Eddington ratios of 0.006-1.2. We avoided AGN emission by extracting the spectra over annular apertures. We modeled the calcium triplet stellar features and measured stellar velocity dispersions of $\sigma_* = 60-230\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$ for the host galaxies. We find $\sigma_*$ values in agreement with previous measurements for local AGN host galaxies, but slightly lower compared with those reported for nearby X-ray-selected type 2 quasars. Using a novel annular aperture correction recipe to estimate $\sigma_e$ from $\sigma_*$ that considers the bulge morphology and observation beam-smearing, we estimate flux-weighted $\sigma_e = 60-250\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$. If we consider the bulge type when estimating $M_\bullet$, we find no statistical difference between the distributions of AGN hosts and the inactive galaxies on the $M_\bullet - \sigma_e$ plane for $M_\bullet \lesssim 10^8\,M_\odot$. Conversely, if we do not consider the bulge type when computing $M_\bullet$, we find that both distributions disagree. We find no correlation between the degree of offset from the $M_\bullet - \sigma_e$ relation and Eddington ratio for $M_\bullet \lesssim 10^8\,M_\odot$. The current statistics preclude firm conclusions from being drawn for the high-mass range. We argue these observations support notions that a significant fraction of the local type 1 AGNs and quasars have undermassive black holes compared with their host galaxy bulge properties.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the signposts of black hole growth, and likely play an important role in galaxy evolution. An outstanding question is whether AGN of different spectral types indicate different evolutionary stages in the coevolution of black holes and galaxies. We present the angular correlation function between an AGN sample selected from the Hyper Suprime Camera Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) optical + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mid-IR photometry, and a luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample from HSC-SSP. We investigate AGN clustering strength as a function of their luminosity and spectral features across three independent HSC fields totaling $\sim600\,{\rm deg^{2}}$, for $z\in0.6-1.2$ and AGN with $L_{6\mu m}&gt;3\times10^{44}{\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}}$. There are $\sim28,500$ AGN and $\sim1.5$ million LRGs in our primary analysis. We determine the inferred average halo mass for the full AGN sample ($M_h \approx 10^{12.9}h^{-1}M_\odot$), and note that it does not evolve significantly as a function of redshift (over this narrow range) or luminosity. We find that, on average, unobscured AGN ($M_h \approx10^{13.3}h^{-1}M_\odot$) occupy $\sim4.5\times$ more massive halos than obscured AGN ($M_h \approx10^{12.6}h^{-1}M_\odot$), at $5\sigma$ statistical significance using 1-D uncertainties, and at $3\sigma$ using the full covariance matrix, suggesting a physical difference between unobscured and obscured AGN, beyond the line-of-sight viewing angle. Furthermore, we find evidence for a halo mass dependence on reddening level within the Type I AGN population, which could support the existence of a previously claimed dust-obscured phase in AGN-host galaxy coevolution. However, we also find that even quite small systematic shifts in the redshift distributions of the AGN sample could plausibly explain current and previously observed differences in $M_{h}$.
