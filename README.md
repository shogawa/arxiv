  The Telescope Array Collaboration recently reported the detection of a cosmic-ray particle, ``Amaterasu", with an extremely high energy of $2.4\times10^{20}$ eV. Here we investigate its probable charge and the locus of its production. Interpreted as a primary iron nucleus or slightly stripped fragment, the event fits well within the existing paradigm for UHECR composition and spectrum. Using the most up-to-date modeling of the Galactic magnetic field strength and structure, and taking into account uncertainties, we identify the likely volume from which it originated. We estimate a localization uncertainty on the source direction of 6.6\% of $4\pi$ or 2726 deg$^2$. The uncertainty of magnetic deflections and the experimental energy uncertainties contribute about equally to the localization uncertainty. The maximum source distance is 8-50 Mpc, with the range reflecting the uncertainty on the energy assignment. We provide sky maps showing the localization region of the event and superimpose the location of galaxies of different types. There are no candidate sources among powerful radio galaxies. An origin in AGNs or star-forming galaxies is unlikely but cannot be completely ruled out without a more precise energy determination. The most straightforward option is that Amaterasu was created in a transient event in an otherwise undistinguished galaxy.

  The nature of the emission region around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, remains under debate. A prediction of jet models is that a frequency-dependent shift in the position of the radio core (core-shift) of active galactic nucleii occurs when observing emission dominated by a highly collimated relativistic outflow. We use millimeter Very Long Baseline Interferometry to study the frequency-dependent position of Sgr A*'s radio core, estimate the core-shift for different emission models, investigate the core-shift evolution as a function of viewing angle and orientation, and study its behaviour in the presence of interstellar scattering. We simulate images of the emission around Sgr A* for accretion inflow models (disks) and relativistic outflow models (jets). They are based on three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We create flux density maps at 22, 43 and 86 GHz sampling different viewing angles and orientations, and examine the effects of scattering. Jet-dominated models show significantly larger core-shifts (in some cases by a factor of 16) than disk-dominated models, intermediate viewing angles (i=30, 45 degrees) show the largest core-shifts. Our jet models follow a power-law relation for the frequency dependent position of Sgr A*'s core. Their core-shifts decrease as the position angle increases from 0 to 90 degrees. Disk models do not fit well a power-law relation and their core-shifts are insensitive to changes in viewing angle. We place an upper limit of 241.65 +-1.93 microarcseconds per cm for the core-shift of jet models including refractive scattering. Our jet models agree with earlier predictions of AGN with conical jets, and the core-shift is retrievable even in the presence of interstellar scattering.

  We present the analysis of new, deep $Chandra$ observations (130~ks) of the galaxy cluster Abell~2495. This object is known for the presence of a triple offset between the peaks of the intracluster medium (ICM), the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the warm gas glowing in H$\alpha$ line. The new $Chandra$ data confirm that the X-ray emission peak is located at a distance of $\sim$6.2 kpc from the BCG, and at $\sim$3.9 kpc from the H$\alpha$ emission peak. Moreover, we identify two generations of X-ray cavities in the ICM, likely inflated by the central radio galaxy activity. Through a detailed morphological and spectral analysis we determine that the power of the AGN outbursts ($P_{cav} = 4.7\pm1.3\times10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$) is enough to counterbalance the radiative losses from ICM cooling ($L_{cool} = 5.7\pm0.1\times10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$). This indicates that, despite a fragmented cooling core, Abell~2495 still harbors an effective feedback cycle. We argue that the offsets are most likely caused by sloshing of the ICM, supported by the presence of spiral structures and a probable cold front in the gas at $\sim$58 kpc east of the center. Ultimately, we find that the outburst interval between the two generations of X-ray cavities is of the order of the dynamical sloshing timescale, as already hinted from the previous $Chandra$ snapshot. We thus speculate that sloshing may be able to regulate the timescales of AGN feedback in Abell~2495, by periodically fuelling the central AGN.

  Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been detected in many Fermi-detected bright blazars. In this letter, we report multiple QPOs detected in a non-blazar AGN PKS 0521-36 searched over the entire 15 years of Fermi-LAT data. QPOs are detected at 268 days, at 295 days, and at 806 days timescales with more than 3$\sigma$ significance. The QPO detected at 806 days happens to be the third harmonic of QPO at 268 days. The time scales are consistent in both Lomb-Scargle and Wavelet analysis. Furthermore, the Gaussian Process modeling of the light curve is performed with stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillator (SHO) and damped random walk (DRW) modeling to uncover the presence of QPOs. The constructed power spectral density (PSD) exhibits two QPOs, with observed timescales of approximately 283 days and 886 days. This is the first non-blazar AGN where the long-term QPO is detected. Earlier studies show this source has a weak beamed jet. The exact cause for these QPOs remains unclear. We also assembled the $\gamma$-ray QPO detected in various blazar and tested the QPO time scale dependent on the black hole mass. No significant correlation is found.

  Coupling of black hole mass to the cosmic expansion has been suggested as a possible path to understanding the dark energy content of the Universe. We test this hypothesis by comparing the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass density at $z=0$ to the total mass accreted in AGN since $z=6$, to constrain how much of the SMBH mass density can arise from cosmologically-coupled growth, as opposed to growth by accretion. Using an estimate of the local SMBH mass density of $\approx 1.0\times10^{6}\,$M$_{\odot}\,$Mpc$^{-1}$, a radiative accretion efficiency, $\eta$: $0.05&lt;\eta&lt;0.3$, and the observed AGN luminosity density at $z\approx 4$, we constrain the value of the coupling constant between the scale size of the Universe and the black hole mass, $k$, to lie in the range $0&lt;k\stackrel{&lt;}{_{\sim}}2$, below the value of $k=3$ needed for black holes to be the source term for dark energy. Initial estimates of the gravitational wave background using pulsar timing arrays, however, favor a higher SMBH mass density at $z=0$. We show that if we adopt such a mass density at $z=0$ of $\approx 7.4\times 10^{6}\,$M$_{\odot}\,$Mpc$^{-1}$, this makes $k=3$ viable even for low radiative efficiencies, and may exclude non-zero cosmological coupling. We conclude that, although current estimates of the SMBH mass density based on the black hole mass -- bulge mass relation probably exclude $k=3$, the possibility remains open that, if the GWB is due to SMBH mergers, $k&gt;2$ is preferred.

  Context: The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) has been providing breakthrough images of the dust in the central parsecs of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), thought to be a key component of the AGN unification scheme and AGN host galaxy interaction. In single infrared bands, these images can have multiple interpretations some of which could challenge the unification scheme. This is the case for the archetypal type 2 AGN of NGC1068. The degeneracy is reduced by multi-band temperature maps which are hindered by ambiguity in alignment between different single band images.   Aims: To solve this problem by creating a chromatic model capable of simultaneously explaining the VLTI GRAVITY+MATISSE $2\mu$m$-13\mu$m observations of the AGN hosted by NGC1068.   Methods: We employ a simple disk and wind geometry populated with black body emitters and dust obscuration to create a versatile multi-wavelength modelling method for chromatic IR interferometric data of dusty objects.   Results: This simple geometry is capable of reproducing the spectro-interferometric data of NGC1068 from K$-$N-band, explains the complex single band images with obscuration and inclination effects, and solves the alignment problem between bands. We find that the resulting inclination and position angle of the model is consistent with those inferred in previous larger scale studies of the narrow line region. Furthermore, the resulting model images visually resemble the multiple achromatic image reconstructions of the same data when evaluated at the same wavelengths. We conclude that the AGN of NGC1068 can indeed be explained by the clumpy disk+wind iteration of the AGN unification scheme. Within the scheme, we find that it is best explained as a type 2 AGN and the obscuring dust chemistry can be explained by a mix of olivine silicates and $16\pm1\%$ amorphous carbon.

  The origin of the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds in Active Galactic Nuclei is still under discussion. We develop the scenario in which the clouds in the outer, less ionized part of BLR, are launched by the radiation pressure acting on dust. Most of the outflow forms a failed wind, so we refer to it as FRADO (Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow), but for a certain parameter range actual outflow also take place. We aim to test the model predictions. In this paper, we present the calculation of the angular distribution of clouds and the net covering factor as this affects the fraction of radiation which can be intercepted and reprocessed in the form of H-beta or Mg II emission line. The results reveal that the covering factor is intricately linked to the mass, accretion rate, and metallicity of the clouds. Notably, as these parameters increase, so does the covering factor, shedding light on the dynamic interplay between the central engine and the surrounding material in AGNs.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently uncovered the presence of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at $z=4-11$. Spectroscopic observations have provided estimates of the nuclear black hole (BH) masses for these sources, extending the low-mass boundary down to $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$. Despite this breakthrough, the observed lowest mass of BHs is still $\gtrsim 1-2$ orders of magnitude heavier than the predicted mass range of their seed population, thereby leaving the initial mass distribution of massive BHs poorly constrained. In this paper, we focus on UV-to-optical (in rest frame) flares of stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) embedded in low-luminosity AGNs as a tool to explore low-mass BH populations with $\lesssim 10^{4-6}~M_\odot$. We provide an estimate of the TDE rate over $z=4-11$ associated wth the properties of JWST-detected AGN host galaxies, and find that deep and wide survey programs with JWST and Roman Space Telescope (RST) can detect and identify TDEs up to $z\simeq 4-7$. The predicted detection numbers of TDEs at $z&gt;4$ in one year are $N_{\rm TDE} \sim 2-10~(0.2-2)$ for the JADES-Medium (and COSMOS-Web) survey with JWST, and $N_{\rm TDE} \sim 2-10~(8-50)$ for the Deep (and Wide) tier of the High-latitude Time Domain Survey with RST. We further discuss the survey strategies to hunt for the transient high-redshift TDEs in wide-field surveys with RST, as well as a joint observation campaign with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory for enhancing the detection number. The high-redshift TDE search will give us a unique opportunity to probe the mass distribution of early BH populations.

  In this study, our primary objective is to compare the properties of SMBH and their host galaxies between type 1 and type 2 AGN. In our analysis, we use X-ray detected sources in two fields, namely the eFEDS and the COSMOS-Legacy. To classify the X-ray sources, we perform SED fitting analysis, using the CIGALE code. Ensuring the robustness of our analysis is paramount, and to achieve this, we impose stringent selection criteria. Thus, only sources with extensive photometric data across the optical, near- and mid-infrared part of the spectrum and reliable host galaxy properties and classifications were included. The final sample consists of 3,312 AGN, of which 3\,049 are classified as type 1 and 263 as type 2. The sources span a redshift range of $\rm 0.5&lt;z&lt;3.5$ and encompass a wide range of L$_X$, falling within $\rm 42&lt;log,[L_{X,2-10keV}(ergs^{-1})]&lt;46$. Our results show that type 2 AGN exhibit a tendency to inhabit more massive galaxies, by $0.2-0.3$\,dex, compared to type 1 sources. Type 2 AGN also display, on average, lower specific black hole accretion rates, a proxy of the Eddington ratio, compared to type 1 AGN. These differences persist across all redshifts and L$_X$ considered within our dataset. Moreover, our analysis uncovers, that type 2 sources tend to have lower star-formation rates compared to 1 AGN, at $\rm z&lt;1$. This picture reverses at $\rm z&gt;2$ and $\rm log,[L_{X,2-10keV}(ergs^{-1})]&gt;44$. Similar patterns emerge when we categorize AGN based on their X-ray obscuration levels ($N_H$). However, in this case, the observed differences are pronounced only for low-to-intermediate L$_X$ AGN and are also sensitive to the $\rm N_H$ threshold applied for the AGN classification. These comprehensive findings enhance our understanding of the intricate relationships governing AGN types and their host galaxy properties across diverse cosmic epochs and luminosity regimes.

  We report superluminal jet motion with an apparent speed of $\beta_\mathrm{app}=1.65\pm0.57$ in the radio-quiet (RQ) low ionisation nuclear emission line region (LINER) galaxy, KISSR872. This result comes from two epoch phase-referenced very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations at 5 GHz. The detection of bulk relativistic motion in the jet of this extremely radio faint AGN, with a total 1.4 GHz flux density of 5 mJy in the 5.4 arcsec resolution Very Large Array (VLA) FIRST survey image and 1.5 mJy in the $\sim5$ milli-arcsec resolution Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) image, is the first of its kind in a RQ LINER galaxy. The presence of relativistic jets in lower accretion rate objects like KISSR872, with an Eddington ratio of 0.04, reveals that even RQ AGN can harbor relativistic jets, and evidentiates their universality over a wide range of accretion powers.

  Active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows including jets and ionized winds have been key phenomena such as jet collimation and AGN feedback to the host galaxy in astrophysics. Radio galaxies, a type of AGN with misaligned jets, have provided valuable insights into the properties and relationships of these outflows. However, several aspects regarding AGN outflows remain unclarified, such as the relationship between jets and ultrafast outflows (UFOs) and the differences between the properties of radio-loud AGN disk winds and radio-quiet AGN ionized winds. To clarify these aspects, radio galaxies containing UFOs and warm absorbers (WAs) must be studied. Currently, both UFOs and WAs have been reported in only two radio galaxies, 3C 390.3 and 4C $+$74.26. To enhance our understanding of the connection between the jets and ionized winds, we conducted a study on Mrk 6, a potential candidate for the third case of a radio galaxy displaying these characteristics. Using X-ray spectra obtained from {\it XMM-Newton}, we performed photoionization modeling using the SPEX code. The best-fit model analysis results revealed the presence of a UFO component with a relatively low ionization parameter (Fe {\sc xix}/{\sc xviii} lines blueshifted by $-34700^{+400}_{-200}~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$) and a WA component with an outflow velocity of $-7600 \pm 200~{\rm km~s }^{-1}$. To further confirm the nature of the UFO and WA in Mrk 6, we simulated the X-ray imagining and spectroscopy mission spectra.

  We previously built a sample of 14,012 extremely variable quasars (EVQs) based on SDSS and Pan-STARRS1 photometric observations. In this work we present the spectral fitting to their SDSS spectra, and study the spectral variation in 1,259 EVQs with multi-epoch SDSS spectra (after prudently excluding spectra with potentially unreliable spectroscopic photometry). We find clear "bluer-when-brighter" trend in EVQs, consistent with previous findings of normal quasars and AGNs. We detect significant intrinsic Baldwin effect (iBeff, i.e., smaller line EW at higher continuum flux in individual AGNs) in the broad MgII and CIV lines of EVQs. Meanwhile, no systematical iBeff is found for the broad Hb line, which could be attributed to strong host contamination at longer wavelengths. Remarkably, by comparing the iBeff slope of EVQs with archived changing-look quasars (CLQs), we show that the CLQs identified in literature are mostly likely a biased (due to its definition) sub-population of EVQs, rather than a distinct population of quasars. We also found no significant broad line breathing of either Hb, MgII or CIV, suggesting the broad line breathing in quasars may disappear at longer timescales ($\sim$ 3000 days).   

Probing the interstellar medium of the quasar BRI0952-0115, an analysis

  The extent of the effect of active galactic nuclei (AGN) on their host galaxies at high-redshift is not apparent and studying this effect in the distant universe is a difficult process as the mechanisms of tracing AGN activity can often be inaccurately associated with intense star formation and vice versa. Our aim is to better understand the processes governing the interstellar medium (ISM) of the quasar BRI0952-0952 at z = 4.432, specifically with regard to the individual heating processes at work and to place the quasar in an evolutionary context. We analyzed ALMA archival bands 3, 4, and 6 data and combined the results with high-resolution band-7 ALMA observations of the quasar. We detect [C I] (2-1), [C II], CO(5-4), CO(7-6), CO(12-11), OH, H2O, and we report a tentative detection of OH+. We update the lensing model from Kade et al. (2023) and use the radiative transfer code MOLPOP-CEP to constrain the properties of the CO, [CI], and [CII] emission and suggest different possible scenarios for heating mechanisms within the quasar. Modeling from the CO SLED suggests that there are extreme heating mechanisms operating within the quasar in the form of star formation or AGN activity; however, with the current data it remains unclear which of the two is the preferred mechanism. The updated lensing model suggests a velocity gradient across the [C II] line, suggestive of on-going kinematical processes within the quasar. We find that the H2O emission in BRI0952 is likely correlated with star-forming regions of the ISM. We use the molecular gas mass from [C I] to calculate a depletion time for the quasar. We conclude that BRI 0952-0952 is a quasar with a significant AGN contribution while also showing signs of extreme starburst activity, indicating that the quasar could be in a transitional phase between a starburst-dominated stage and an AGN-dominated stage.

  We present a comprehensive study of the physical origin of radio emission in optical quasars at redshifts z &lt; 2.5. We focus particularly on the associations between compact radio emission, dust reddening, and outflows identified in our earlier work. Leveraging the deepest low-frequency radio data available to date (LoTSS Deep DR1), we achieve radio detection fractions of up to 94%, demonstrating the virtual ubiquity of radio emission in quasars, and a continuous distribution in radio loudness. Through our analysis of radio properties, combined with spectral energy distribution modeling of multiwavelength photometry, we establish that the primary source of radio emission in quasars is the AGN, rather than star formation. Modeling the dust reddening of the accretion disk emission shows a continuous increase in radio detection in quasars as a function of the reddening parameter E(B-V), suggesting a causal link between radio emission and dust reddening. Confirming previous findings, we observe that the radio excess in red quasars is most pronounced for sources with compact radio morphologies and intermediate radio loudness. We find a significant increase in [Oiii] and Civ outflow velocities for red quasars not seen in our control sample, with particularly powerful [Oiii] winds in those around the radio-quiet/radio-loud threshold. Based on the combined characterisation of radio, reddening, and wind properties in our sample, we favor a model in which the compact radio emission observed in quasars originates in compact radio jets and their interaction with a dusty, circumnuclear environment. Our results align with the theory that jet-induced winds and shocks resulting from this interaction are the origin of the enhanced radio emission in red quasars. Further investigation of this model is crucial for advancing our understanding of quasar feedback mechanisms and their role in galaxy evolution.
