  The origin of high-energy cosmic neutrinos detected by the IceCube observatory is a hotly debated topic in astroparticle physics. There is growing evidence that some of these neutrinos can be associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN) and especially with blazars. Several recent studies have revealed a statistical correlation between radio-bright AGN samples and IceCube neutrino event catalogs. In addition, a growing number of individual high-energy neutrinos have been found to coincide with individual radio-flaring blazars. These observational results strongly call for high-quality, high angular-resolution radio observations of such neutrino-associated blazars to study their parsec-scale jet structures. TANAMI is the only large and long-term VLBI monitoring program focused on the Southern sky. Within TANAMI, we put an emphasis on Southern IceCube neutrino candidate blazars at 2.3 GHz and 8.4 GHz. Here we present first results of the first high-quality, high angular-resolution VLBI observations of nine Southern-Hemisphere blazars that were associated to IceCube neutrino hotspots in the Southern sky. In the near future, the rapidly growing KM3NeT will complement IceCube by being sensitive to high-energy neutrinos mainly from the Southern Hemisphere. This will increase the importance of Southern-Hemisphere radio monitoring programs of neutrino-associated blazars, like TANAMI.

  The origin of the low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) prevalent in local galaxies and its relationship with supermassive black holes are debated for decades. We preform a comprehensive evaluation of traditional photoionization models against the circumnuclear ionized gas in M81, for which recent CAHA/PPAK integral-field spectroscopic observations reveal a LINER characteristic out to a galactocentric radius of ~1 kpc. Constructed with the photoionization code cloudy, the models have the novel aspect of their primary parameters being well constrained by extensive observations of a prototypical low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) and an old stellar bulge in M81. Additionally, these models incorporate a reasonably broad range of uncertain nebular properties. It is found that the integrated photoionization by the LLAGN and hot, low-mass stars distributed in the bulge can roughly reproduce the observed radial intensity distributions of the Halpha, Hbeta and [N ii] lines, with the bulge stars dominating the ionizing flux at radii &gt;~200 pc. However, the models generally fail to reproduce a similarly declining profile of the [Oiii] line or an accordingly flat profile of the [O iii]/Hbeta ratio. This clearly points to a deficiency of ionizing photons in the outer regions despite an extended photoionization source. The discrepancy might be alleviated if much of the observed [O iii] line arose from a bulge-filling, low-density gas surrounding a denser, Halpha-emitting disk, or by a higher AGN luminosity in the recent past. The case of M81 has important implications for the ionization mechanism of LINERs and low-ionization emission-line regions in general.

  In the manuscript, effects of Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are estimated on long-term AGN variability, to provide interesting clues to detect probable hidden TDEs in normal broad line AGN with apparent intrinsic variability which overwhelm the TDEs expected variability features, after considering the unique TDEs expected variability patterns. Based on theoretical TDEs expected variability plus AGN intrinsic variability randomly simulated by Continuous AutoRegressive process, long-term variability properties with and without TDEs contributions are well analyzed in AGN. Then, interesting effects of TDEs can be determined on long-term observed variability of AGN. First, more massive BHs, especially masses larger than $10^7{\rm M_\odot}$, can lead to more sensitive and positive dependence of $\tau_{TN}$ on $R_{TN}$, with $\tau_{TN}$ as variability timescale ratio of light curves with TDEs contributions to intrinsic light curves without TDEs contributions, and $R_{TN}$ as ratio of peak intensity of TDEs expected variability to the mean intensity of intrinsic AGN variability without TDEs contributions. Second, stronger TDEs contributions $R_{TN}$ can lead to $\tau_{TN}$ quite larger than 5. Third, for intrinsic AGN variability having longer variability timescales, TDEs contributions will lead $\tau_{TN}$ to be increased more slowly. The results actually provide an interesting forward-looking method to detect probable hidden TDEs in normal broad line AGN, due to quite different variability properties, especially different DRW/CAR process expected variability timescales, in different epochs, especially in normal broad line AGN with shorter intrinsic variability timescales and with BH masses larger than $10^7{\rm M_\odot}$.

  We investigate the time-varying electromagnetic emission of a low-mass-ratio supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) embedded in a circumprimary disk, with a particular interest in variability of shocks driven by the binary. We perform a 2D, locally isothermal hydrodynamics simulation of a SMBHB with mass ratio $q=0.01$ and separation $a=100\;R_g$, using a physically self-consistent steady disk model. We estimate the electromagnetic variability from the system by monitoring accretion onto the secondary and using an artificial viscosity scheme to capture shocks and monitor the energy dissipated. The SMBHB produces a wide, eccentric gap in the disk, previously only observed for larger mass ratios, which we attribute to our disk model being much thinner ($H/R\approx0.01$ near the secondary) than is typical of previous works. The eccentric gap drives periodic accretion onto the secondary SMBH on a timescale matching the orbital period of the binary, $t_{\rm{bin}}\approx0.1\;\rm{yr}$, implying that the variable accretion regime of the SMBHB parameter space extends to lower mass ratios than previously established. Shocks driven by the binary are periodic, with a period matching the orbital period, and the shocks are correlated with the accretion rate, with peaks in the shock luminosity lagging peaks in the accretion rate by $0.43\;t_{\rm{bin}}$. We propose that the correlation of these quantities represents a useful identifier of SMBHB candidates, via observations of correlated variability in X-ray and UV monitoring of AGN, rather than single-waveband periodicity alone.

  We present spatially resolved gas kinematics, ionization, and energetics of 11 type 1 and 5 type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong ionized gas outflows at z $&lt;0.3$ using Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph Integral Field Unit (GMOS-IFU) data. We find a strongly blueshifted region in [OIII] velocity maps, representing an approaching cone in biconical outflows, and blueshifted and redshifted regions in H$\alpha$ velocity maps, which show gravitationally rotating kinematics. AGN photoionization is dominant in the central region of most targets, and some of them also show ring-like structures of LINER or composite that surround the AGN-dominated center. Following our previous studies, we kinematically determine outflow sizes by the ratio between [OIII] and stellar velocity dispersion. Outflow sizes of type 1 AGNs follow the same kinematic outflow size-[OIII] luminosity relation obtained from the type 2 IFU sample in Kang &amp; Woo and Luo (updated slope $0.29\pm0.04$), while they are limited to the central kpc scales, indicating the lack of global impact of outflows on the interstellar medium. Small mass outflow rates and large star formation rates of the combined sample support that there is no evidence of rapid star formation quenching by outflows, which is consistent with the delayed AGN feedback.

  We present a new observational test to identify massive black hole binaries in large multi-epoch spectroscopical catalogues and to probe the real nature of already proposed binary candidates. The test is tailored for binaries with separations large enough to allow each black hole to retain its own broad line region. In this limit the fast AGN variability typically observed over months cannot be associated to the much longer binary period, and it is assumed (as for the case of single black holes) to be the consequence of the evolution of the innermost regions of the two accretion discs. A simple analysis of the cross-correlation between different parts of individual broad emission lines can therefore identify the presence of two massive black holes whose continua vary independently of each other. Our analysis indicates that to be less affected by the noise in the spectra the broad lines should be divided in two close-to-equal-flux parts. This ensures that in the single massive black hole scenario the cross-correlation will always be high. With monitoring campaigns similar to those performed for reverberation mapping studies, on the other way, a binary can show any value of the cross-correlation and can therefore be distinguished from a standard AGN. The new test can be performed over timescales orders of magnitude shorter than the alternative tests already discussed in literature, and can be a powerful complement to the massive black hole binary search strategies already in place.
