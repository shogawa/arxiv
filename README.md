  The recurrent activity of radio AGN, with phases of activity alternating with periods of quiescence, has been known since the early studies of these objects. The full relevance of this cycle is emphasised by the requirement, from the AGN feedback scenario, of a recurrent impact of the energy released by the SMBH during the lifetime of the host galaxy: only in this way can AGN feedback influence galaxy evolution. Radio AGN in different evolutionary phases can be identified by their properties, like morphology and spectral indices. Dying/remnant and restarted sources have been the most elusive to select and characterise, but they are crucial to quantify the full life cycle. Thanks to the availability of new, large radio surveys (particularly at low frequencies), it is finally possible to make a more complete census of these rare sources and start building larger samples. This paper gives an overview of the recent work conducted using a variety of radio telescopes and surveys, highlighting some of the new results characterising the properties of dying/remnant and restarted radio sources and what has been learned about the life cycle of radio AGN. The comparison with the predictions from numerical simulations is also discussed. The results so far show that remnant and restarted radio AGN have a variety of properties which make these objects more complex than previously thought.

  In accordance with the AGN Unified Model, observed polarization can be related to the orientation of the line of sight with respect to the torus. AGN X-ray emission arises from the central region and carries the imprints of the obscuring material. We aim to test a unified scheme based on optical polarization using X-ray absorption. Using the XMM-Newton data of 19, optically polarized Seyfert 1 sources, we developed a systematic analysis by fitting a baseline model to test the presence of X-ray neutral or ionized (warm) absorption. We find that 100\% of the polar-polarized sources show the presence of absorption, with 70\% favoring the presence of a warm absorber. In contrast, the equatorial-polarized sources show a fraction of absorbed spectra of 75\%, with only 50\% consistent with the presence of a warm absorber.

  We present an all-southern sky survey for MgII doublet absorbers in 951 z &lt; 4 AGN/quasar spectra from the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES). The spectral resolution ranges from R = 1400-1700 over the wavelengths 3700 A-8800 A. The survey has a 5sigma detection completeness of 50% and above for rest-frame equivalent widths W_r(2796) &gt;= 0.3 A. We studied 656 MgII absorption systems over the redshift range 0.33 &lt; z &lt; 2.19 with equivalent widths 0.3 &lt; W_r(2796) &lt; 3.45 A. The equivalent width distribution is well fit by an exponential function with W* = 0.76 +/- 0.04 A and the redshift path density exhibits very little evolution. Overall, our findings are consistent with the large, predominantly northern-sky, surveys of MgII absorbers. We developed and implemented a Monte Carlo model informed by a high-resolution MgII survey for determining the MgII mass density, Omega_MgII. We found Omega_MgII ~ 5 x 10^-7 with no evidence of evolution over a ~7 Gyr time span following Cosmic Noon. Incorporating measurements covering 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 6.4 from the literature, we extended our insights into MgII mass density evolution from the end of reionization well past the Cosmic Noon epoch. The presented Monte Carlo model has potential for advancing our knowledge of the evolution of mass densities of metal-ions common to quasar absorption line studies, as it exploits the efficiency of large low-resolution surveys while requiring only small samples from expensive high-resolution surveys.
