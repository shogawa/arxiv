  Relativistic jets around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are well-known powerful $\gamma$-ray emitters. In absence of the jets in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), how the SMBHs work in $\gamma$-ray bands is still unknown despite of great observational efforts made in the last 3 decades. Considering the previous efforts, we carefully select an AGN sample composed of 37 nearby Seyfert galaxies with ultra-hard X-rays for the goals of $\gamma$-ray detections by excluding all potential contamination in this band. Adopting a stacking technique, here we report the significant $\gamma$-ray detection (${\rm TS}=30.6$, or $5.2\,\sigma$) from the sample using 15-year Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observation. We find an average $\gamma$-ray luminosity of the sample as $(1.5\pm1.0)\times10^{40}{\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ at energies from 1-300\,GeV. Limited by the well-known pair production from the interaction of $\gamma$-rays with low energy photons, $\gtrsim$ several GeV $\gamma$-rays are found to originate from an extended corona ($\sim 2.7\times 10^6\,R_{\rm g}$), whereas the canonical much more compact X-ray corona ($\sim 10\,R_{\rm g}$) is responsible for 1 to several GeV $\gamma$-rays. The finding of the compact region lends to strong supports to the long-time theoretical expectations, but the extended corona is beyond all the existing models. One promising scenario is that the electron-positron pairs produced in the compact X-ray corona would expand as fireball, similar to that in $\gamma$-ray bursts, forming the structure of extended corona.

  We present a continuum lag analysis for a sample of 37 relatively high-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP), utilizing the light curve data in $B$ and $V$ bands from SAMP and in $g,r,i$ bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that the inter-band lags ($\tau$) increase with wavelength (i.e., $\tau \propto \lambda^{\sim 4/3}$) as prescribed by the standard disk model (SSD), suggesting consistency with the "lamp-post" reprocessing model. We report that the size of the continuum emitting region (CER) normalized at 2500 {\AA} ($R_{2500}$) is a factor of $\sim$5 (i.e, $0.69\pm0.04$ dex) larger than predicted by SSD. By combining our new measurements with the re-measurements of the literature sample, we report a correlation between $R_{2500}$ and AGN continuum luminosity as $R_{2500} \, \propto \, L_{5100}^{0.58\pm0.03}$, which suggests that the observed continuum could be composed of both the disk emission and the diffuse emission from the broad line region (BLR). The size of CER shows a tight relation with the size of H$\beta$ BLR with a sublinear slope (i.e., $R_{\text{BLR}} \, \propto \, R_{\text{2500}}^{0.87\pm0.07}$) and a scatter of 0.29 dex. This empirical relation offers a promising method for estimating single-epoch black hole masses, once established over a large dynamic range of AGN luminosity.

  Obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides insights into the material surrounding the central engine. Compton-thick AGN (CTAGN), characterized by a column density of $N_{\mathrm{H}} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{24} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, are heavily obscured by dust and gas. While X-ray observations primarily determine this column density, the sub-mm obscuration properties of CTAGN remain less explored. We analyze archival ALMA CO(3-2) data for CTAGN and non-CTAGN from the 70-month $\textit{Swift}$/BAT catalog and other X-ray surveys. Integrated intensity maps (moment 0) reveal dense gas concentrated around the nucleus. Assuming a constant CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor, $X_{\mathrm{CO}} = 2.2 \times 10^{20} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \ (\mathrm{K\ km\ s}^{-1})^{-1}$, we find that molecular hydrogen column densities ($N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$) are generally lower than X-ray-derived total hydrogen column densities ($N_{\mathrm{H}}$). However, $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ values in this work are slightly higher than in previous studies due to the adopted conversion factor. The discrepancy between $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ aligns with prior findings that X-ray-derived values tend to be higher, except for non-CTAGN, where $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ can exceed $N_{\mathrm{H}}$. Kendall and Spearman tests indicate a positive monotonic correlation, though not statistically significant, suggesting a complex interplay of factors. The optically thick nature of CO in dense regions may contribute to the observed differences. Our results highlight the need for an accurate CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor in deriving column densities, potentially offering an alternative method for identifying CTAGN. Future studies with larger datasets and refined methodologies are essential for a deeper understanding of sub-mm and X-ray properties in AGN.

  The geometric distances of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are challenging to measure because of their exceptionally compact structure yet vast cosmic distances. A combination of spectroastrometry and reverberation mapping (SARM) of broad-line regions (BLRs) constitutes a novel means to probe the geometric distance of AGNs, which has recently become practically feasible owing to successful interferometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY. Here, we perform SARM analysis of four nearby quasars: Mrk 509, PDS 456, 3C 273, and NGC 3783. Results for the former two are reported for the first time and the latter two are revisited using our improved BLR dynamical modeling that includes the radial-dependent responsivity of BLRs. This allows us to self-consistently account for the emissivity weighting of the BLR in spectroastrometry and responsivity weighting in reverberation mapping. We obtain angular-diameter distances of the four quasars, from which we derive a Hubble constant of $H_0=69_{-10}^{+12}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. Although this consititutes a large uncertainty for a measurement of $H_0$, it is anticipated that the precision will improve to a competitive level once a greater number of AGNs are accessible following the upgrade of GRAVITY in the near future. From SARM analysis, the black hole masses of the four quasars are also measured with the statistical uncertainty ranging from 0.06 to 0.23 dex, consistent with the correlations between black hole masses and properties of the host bulges.

  Measuring the distance of quasar outflows from the central source ($R$) is essential for determining their importance for AGN feedback. There are two methods to measure $R$: 1) A direct determination using spatially resolved Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) of the outflow in emission. 2) An indirect method which uses the absorption troughs from ionic excited states. The column density ratio between the excited and resonance states yields the outflow number density. Combined with a knowledge of the outflow's ionization parameter, $R$ can be determined. Generally, the IFS method probes $R$ range of several kpc or more, while the absorption method usually yields $R$ values of less than 1 kpc. There is no inconsistency between the two methods as the determinations come from different objects. Here we report the results of applying both methods to the same quasar outflow, where we derive consistent determinations of $R$ $\approx$ 5 kpc. This is the first time where the indirect absorption $R$ determination is verified by a direct spatially resolved IFS observation. In addition, the velocities (and energetics) from the IFS and absorption data are also found to be consistent. Therefore, these are two manifestations of the same outflow. In this paper we concentrate on the absorption $R$ determination for the outflow seen in quasar 3C 191 using VLT/X-shooter observations. We also reanalyze an older absorption determination for the outflow based on Keck/HIRES data and find that revised measurement to be consistent with ours. Our companion paper details the IFS analysis of the same object.

  Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars exhibit significant outflows, offering insights into active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. While typically associated with high Eddington ratios, BAL quasars also occur in low Eddington ratio regimes, which remain poorly understood. This study aims to compare BAL properties and variability across these regimes.We investigate the occurrence rates, absorption characteristics, and variability of BAL quasars at low and high Eddington ratios. Using the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog, we selected a redshift-matched control sample to compare low and high Eddington ratio BAL quasar sources. We first examined the BAL fraction as a function of Eddington ratio. Key absorption parameters-equivalent width, absorption line width, velocity range, and depth-were analyzed, and a multi-epoch variability study was conducted using repeat spectra, followed by a comparison of parameter distributions between the two samples. For the first time, we report an increase in BAL fraction toward low Eddington ratios, in addition to the previously known trend of high BAL fraction at high Eddington ratios. While high Eddington sources show extreme absorption features, overall distributions are statistically similar except for maximum outflow velocity. No significant variability differences were observed. The correlation between outflow velocity, Eddington ratio, and luminosity supports the role of radiation pressure in driving quasar outflows. For low Eddington ratios, additional mechanisms, such as softer SEDs, larger outflow distances, and thickened accretion disks from radiatively inefficient processes, likely drive outflow formation.
