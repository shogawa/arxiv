  Among the emerging excess of massive, bright galaxies at Cosmic Dawn $z \gtrsim 9$ seen by the James Webb Space Telescope, several exhibit spectral features associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN candidates suggest that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow rapidly in the early Universe. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate how SMBHs grow within and influence the most massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations run with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. Our suite of simulations explore how super-Eddington accretion, seed mass, and the strength of feedback influence SMBH-galaxy co-evolution in the early Universe. We find that SMBH growth is sensitive to stellar feedback which generates a turbulent-multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) that stochastically starves the SMBH. In the absence of AGN feedback, we find that the SMBH is starved $\sim 50\%$ of the time after the onset of star formation in the galaxy. SMBH growth can become self-regulated by AGN feedback if the SMBH becomes massive enough, either by accretion or seeding, for its feedback to dominate the surrounding nuclear region. We find no evidence of galaxy-scale, AGN-driven quenching in the star formation rate (SFR) across all simulations in our suite.

  The origin of TeV-PeV neutrinos detected by IceCube remains largely unknown. The most significant individual neutrino source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$ level with a soft spectral index. Another notable candidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a potential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this source returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated by two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and IC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV, implying a maximum proton energy &gt; 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC 1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino spectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT observations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade flux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV flux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the neutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons are accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the corona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and X-rays from the corona through the $p\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with energy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required maximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to unity ($\sigma\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization parameter with $\sigma\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated composition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino spectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different magnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN.

  Jets from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are expected to heat the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We investigate how the interaction between jets and the ICM appears in high-resolution X-ray observations using mock X-ray observations based on two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We constructed a model of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) similar to Cygnus A (Cyg A), a powerful FR II radio galaxy. Our simulations model bipolar jets propagating into a stratified ICM, forming forward shocks and low-density cocoons. Based on these results, we generate synthetic spectra that incorporate both shocked and unshocked ICM components. Then, we perform mock observations using the XRISM/Resolve X-ray spectrometer. We focus particularly on viewing angle effects. Our mock observations revealed that the smallest line broadening, observed as velocity dispersion, associated with the cocoon's bulk expansion occurs when observing along the jet direction, where the expansion velocity is highest. Although this may appear counterintuitive, it occurs because the rapidly expanding jet head contributes little to X-ray emission due to its high temperature and low density. Our results highlight the importance of considering the temperature and density structure of AGN-driven shocks and cocoons when interpreting XRISM data. These findings lay the groundwork for XRISM's observations of AGN jets and will improve our understanding of AGN feedback processes in galaxy clusters.

  The distribution of molecular gas on small scales regulates star formation and the growth of supermassive black holes in galaxy centers, yet the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping this distribution remains poorly constrained. We investigate how AGN influence the small-scale structure of molecular gas in galaxy centers, by measuring the clumpiness of CO(3 - 2) emission observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the nuclear regions (50 - 200 pc from the AGN) of 16 nearby Seyfert galaxies from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). To quantify clumpiness, we apply three different methods: (1) the median of the pixel-by-pixel contrast between the original and smoothed maps; (2) the ratio of the total excess flux to the total flux, after substracting the background smoothed emission; and (3) the fraction of total flux coming from clumpy regions, interpreted as the mass fraction in clumps. We find a negative correlation between molecular gas clumpiness and AGN X-ray luminosity (L_X), suggesting that higher AGN activity is associated with smoother gas distributions. All methods reveal a turnover in this relation around L_X = 10^{42} erg/s, possibly indicating a threshold above which AGN feedback becomes efficient at dispersing dense molecular structures and suppressing future star formation. Our findings provide new observational evidence that AGN feedback can smooth out dense gas structures in galaxy centers.
