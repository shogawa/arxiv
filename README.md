Recent intensive monitoring campaigns of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have provided simultaneous X-ray, UV, and optical data of unprecedented quality. The observations reveal a strong correlation between the UV and optical variability, but a weaker correlation between the X-ray and UV bands, challenging the standard X-ray reprocessing scenario. We revisit the X-ray/UV connection in NGC 5548 by fitting archival 2014 HST and Swift/XRT light curves assuming X-ray reverberation from a dynamically evolving X-ray corona. Our results show that, as long as the corona height, photon index and power vary over time, X-ray reverberation can explain the observed UV and optical variability within 2% and 5%, respectively (on average). The evolution of the best-fit parameters suggests that fast changes in coronal geometry and energetics on a time scale of days are required to explain the observed variability.

Rotating galaxies with relaxed gaseous disks have been discovered across cosmic time, from the local Universe to high redshift (z&gt;4). But few such sources have been confirmed at z&gt;4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy.

"Little red dots" (LRDs) represent a new population of astronomical objects uncovered by JWST whose nature remains debated. Although many LRDs are suspected as active galactic nuclei (AGN), they show little variability on days-years timescales. We report the discovery of two gravitationally lensed LRDs at redshift $\sim$4.3 behind the cluster RXCJ2211-0350, one of which (RX1) is quadruply imaged with time delays spanning $\sim$130 years. RX1 exhibits intrinsic color and brightness variations of up to 0.7 magnitude among its images. These changes are consistent with blackbody-temperature variations of a photosphere, indicating long-term variability analogous to Cepheid-like pulsations but in a far more extended ($R \sim 2000$ AU) and massive ($M \gtrsim 10^6 \, M_{\odot}$) systems. These results suggest LRDs as a distinct class of AGN with stellar-like envelopes.

Radio-loud high-redshift quasars (RHRQs) provide crucial insights into the evolution of relativistic jets and their connection to the growth of supermassive black holes. Beyond the extensively studied population at $z \ge 5$, the cosmic morning epoch ($3 \lesssim z \lesssim 5$) marks the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and black hole accretion, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we compiled the radio high-redshift quasar catalog (RHzQCat) by cross-matching the SDSS DR16Q catalog with four major radio surveys -- FIRST,NVSS, RACS, and GLEAM. Our tier-based cross-matching framework and visual validation ensured reliable source identification across surveys with diverse beam sizes. The catalog included 1629 reliable and 315 candidate RHRQs, with radio luminosities uniformly spanning $10^{25.5}$ -- $10^{29.3}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. About 95\% of the confirmed sources exhibited compact morphologies, consistent with Doppler-boosted or young AGN populations at high redshifts. Our catalog increases the number of known RHRQs at $z\ge3$ by an order of magnitude, representing the largest and most homogeneous catalog of radio quasars at cosmic morning, filling the observational gap between the early ($z&gt;6$) and local Universe. It provides a robust reference for future statistical studies of jet evolution, AGN feedback, and cosmic magnetism with next-generation facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).
