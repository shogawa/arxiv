We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\bullet$, and disk viscosity $α$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\dot{M}/α\gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot /{\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population.

We present a comprehensive framework for predicting the detection prospects of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) by future gravitational wave (GW) observatories, examining both space-borne detectors (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) and next-generation pulsar timing array (PTA) combined with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-PTA). Leveraging dual active galactic nucleus (AGN) fractions and AGN X-ray luminosity functions, we systematically evaluate the detectable SMBHB populations with a detection threshold of signal-to-noise ratio $\geq 5$ for each GW observatory. Our analysis reveals that space-borne detectors are expected to identify approximately $\sim 1 \text{--} 2$ to $\sim 20$ events per year, depending on the SMBHB orbital evolution prescriptions. On the other hand, SKA-PTA demonstrates the potential to reach the first GW detection from individual SMBHBs within a few years of observation and achieve detectable GW source counts of $10^2 \text{--} 10^3$ after about 10 years, depending on PTA configurations. These facilities will significantly improve SMBHB detectability and enable characterization of their properties across different frequency bands.

Some cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in powering the Ly$α$ nebulae observed around high-redshift quasars. In such simulations, AGN feedback seeded as powerful outflows leads to extended and luminous nebulae whose morphology and surface-brightness profiles accurately reproduce the observations, while suppressing AGN feedback leads to compact and faint nebulae. This link might arise from outflows opening up a channel for Ly$α$ photons to escape from the galactic nucleus to the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The main aim of this paper is to test this theoretical prediction using observations, by comparing the physical properties of outflows and Ly$α$ nebulae. We analyze integral-field unit data obtained with VLT/ERIS and GEMINI/GNIRS to trace the ionized gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a sample of six quasars at $z\sim2-3$, using the [O III] emission line. We detect powerful outflows in all the quasars of our sample, with velocities $&gt;1500~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and kinetic energies $ \gtrsim 2\times10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. Four of our quasars are spatially resolved and show signs of extended [O III] emission out to distances $&gt;2$ kpc from the central supermassive black hole. When excluding one outlier, we find a positive monotonic correlation between the outflow power and the Ly$α$ nebulae size ($ρ=0.89$, $p=0.03$) and luminosity ($ρ=0.6$, $p=0.28$). Additionally, we find evidence of spatial alignment between the ionization cone and the inner and brightest regions of the Ly$α$ nebula. Our results provide tentative evidence in support of the theoretical prediction that AGN-driven outflows at ISM scales open a low-optical-depth path for central Ly$α$ photons to reach the CGM and create extended nebulae.

High-energy neutrinos provide a potentially powerful and distinctive probe for dark matter (DM) - neutrino interactions, particularly in environments with enhanced DM densities, such as the DM spikes predicted to form around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, which identified four AGN, namely TXS 0506+056, NGC 1068, PKS 1424+240, and NGC 4151 as neutrino sources, provide a unique opportunity to search for signatures of these interactions. In this study, we use IceCube data to derive the most stringent constraints to date on both the energy-dependent and energy-independent DM-neutrino scattering cross-sections. We perform a statistical analysis using data from individual sources as well as a combined (stacked) analysis of all four sources. Our strongest limits arise from the stacking analysis, yielding an upper bound of $σ_{0} \le 8\times 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for an energy-independent cross-section and $σ_{0} \le 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for a linearly energy-dependent cross-section, both at 90\% confidence level, particularly in scenarios involving the adiabatic growth of black holes.

Reverberation mapping (RM) determines the mass of black holes (BH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by resolving the BH gravitational sphere of influence in the time domain. Recent RM campaigns yielded direct BH masses through dynamical modeling for a sample of 32 objects, spanning a wide range of AGN luminosities and BH masses. In addition, accurate BH masses have been determined by spatially resolving the broad-line region with GRAVITY for a handful of AGNs. Here, we present a detailed analysis of Hubble Space Telescope images using surface-brightness profile fitting with state-of-the-art programs. We derive AGN luminosity and host-galaxy properties, such as radii and luminosities for spheroid, disk, and bar (if present). The spheroid effective radii were used to measure stellar velocity dispersion from integral-field spectroscopy. Since the BH masses of our sample do not depend on any assumption of the virial factor needed in single-epoch spectroscopic mass estimates, we can show that the resulting scaling relations between the mass of the supermassive BHs and their host galaxies match those of quiescent galaxies, naturally extending to lower masses in these (predominantly) spiral galaxies. We find that the inner AGN orientation, as traced by the broad-line region inclination angle, is uncorrelated with the host-galaxy disk. Our sample has the most direct and accurate MBH measurements of any AGN sample and provides a fundamental local benchmark for studies of the evolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies across cosmic time.
