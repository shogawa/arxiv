  We present the first systematic study of the molecular gas and star formation efficiency in a sample of ten narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies selected to have X-ray Ultra Fast Outflows and, therefore, to potentially show AGN feedback effects. CO observations were obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope in six galaxies and from the literature for four galaxies. We derived the stellar mass, star formation rate, AGN and FIR dust luminosities by fitting the multi-band spectral energy distributions with the CIGALE code. Most of the galaxies in our sample lie above the main sequence (MS) and the molecular depletion time is one to two orders of magnitude shorter than the one typically measured in local star-forming galaxies. Moreover, we found a promising correlation between the star formation efficiency and the Eddington ratio, as well as a tentative correlation with the AGN luminosity. The role played by the AGN activity in the regulation of star formation within the host galaxies of our sample remains uncertain (little or no effect? positive feedback?). Nevertheless, we can conclude that quenching by the AGN activity is minor and that star formation will likely stop in a short time due to gas exhaustion by the current starburst episode.

  We present a near infrared spectroscopic atlas of nearby, bright early-type galaxies with radio emission, containing 163 galaxies observed by the Palomar 200" TripleSpec instrument, measuring the emission line fluxes for H, He, [Fe II] and H$_2$ and determined the nuclear excitation mechanisms. By stacking spectra, we deduced the H$_2$ excitation temperature ($1957\pm182$ K) and dominant excitation mechanism (thermal and shock heating combined) from the $\textit{K}$-band emission line sequence. Stacking also produces an "average" spectrum of absorption features and spectral indices from the literature; the CO12 absorption line index vs. $\textit{J-K}$ colour shows a trend of stronger nuclear activity producing a weaker CO12 index and a redder (flatter) continuum. The correlations between the radio and the emission-line luminosities finds a trend with radio power; however, the large scatter in the upper limits shows that the two are not directly coupled and the duty cycles of SF and AGN activity are not synchronised.

  With the advent of deep, all-sky radio surveys, the need for ancillary data to make the most of the new, high-quality radio data from surveys like the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU), GLEAM-X, VLASS and LoTSS is growing rapidly. Radio surveys produce significant numbers of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), and have a significantly higher average redshift when compared with optical and infrared all-sky surveys. Thus, traditional methods of estimating redshift are challenged, with spectroscopic surveys not reaching the redshift depth of radio surveys, and AGNs making it difficult for template fitting methods to accurately model the source. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been used, but efforts have typically been directed towards optically selected samples, or samples at significantly lower redshift than expected from upcoming radio surveys. This work compiles and homogenises a radio-selected dataset from both the northern hemisphere (making use of SDSS optical photometry), and southern hemisphere (making use of Dark Energy Survey optical photometry). We then test commonly used ML algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Random Forest, ANNz and GPz on this monolithic radio-selected sample. We show that kNN has the lowest percentage of catastrophic outliers, providing the best match for the majority of science cases in the EMU survey. We note that the wider redshift range of the combined dataset used allows for estimation of sources up to z = 3 before random scatter begins to dominate. When binning the data into redshift bins and treating the problem as a classification problem, we are able to correctly identify $\approx$76% of the highest redshift sources - sources at redshift z $&gt;$ 2.51 - as being in either the highest bin (z $&gt;$ 2.51), or second highest (z = 2.25).

  The galaxy CID-42 (CXOC J100043.1+020637.2) at z=0.359 has been proposed to contain a promising candidate for a gravitational wave (GW) recoiling supermassive black hole (SMBH), a slingshot SMBH from a triple-SMBH interaction, or a kpc-scale dual Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These claims were primarily based on a pair of bright cores separated by $\sim 0.''5$ resolved in optical HST imaging. Existing HST, Chandra and ground-based imaging and spectroscopy are unable to confirm either scenario. With improved spatial resolution, depth, and IR wavelength coverage, NIRCam multi-band imaging from the COSMOS-Web JWST treasury program well resolved the two cores in CID-42, revealing a significant stellar bulge for both cores (with stellar masses of $\sim 10^{10}\,M_\odot$ for both). JWST imaging further revealed that only the SE core contains an unobscured AGN point source, based on both image decomposition and spectral energy distribution fitting. There is no evidence for AGN activity in the NW core. These new observations unambiguously rule out the GW-recoiling and slingshot SMBH scenarios, and establish CID-42 as a low-redshift merging pair of galaxies, with only one active AGN in the system. These results demonstrate the unparalleled capabilities of JWST (even with imaging alone) in studying the galactic-scale environment of merging galaxies and SMBHs.

  The combined study of the flaring of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at radio wavelengths and pc-scale jet kinematics with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has led to the view that i) the observed flares are associated with ejections of synchrotron blobs from the core, and ii) most of the flaring would follow a one-to-one correlation with the component ejection. Recent results have provided mounting evidence that the quasi-regular component injections into the relativistic jet may not be the only cause of the flux variability. We propose that AGN flux variability and jet morphology changes can both be of deterministic nature, i.e. having a geometric/kinetic origin linked to the time-variable Doppler beaming of the jet emission as its direction changes due to precession (and nutation). The physics of the underlying jet leads to shocks, instabilities, or to ejections of plasmoids. The appearance (morphology, flux, etc.) of the jet can, however, be strongly affected and modulated by precession. We demonstrate this modulating power of precession for OJ 287. For the first time, we show that the spectral state of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) can be directly related to the jet's precession phase. We model the SED evolution and reproduce the precession parameters. Further, we apply our precession model to eleven prominent AGN. We show that for OJ 287 precession seems to dominate the long-term variability ($\gtrsim 1\,{\rm yr}$) of the AGN flux, SED spectral state, and jet morphology, while stochastic processes affect the variability on short timescales ($\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm yr}$).

  The Galactic Center (GC) is surrounded by plasma lobes that extend up to ~14 kpc above and below the plane. Until now, UV absorption studies of these lobes have only focused on high-velocity components (|v_LSR| &gt; 100 km/s) because low- and intermediate-velocity (LIV) components (|v_LSR| &lt;100 km/s) are blended with foreground interstellar medium. To overcome this difficulty, we present a differential experiment to compare the LIV absorption between different structures within the GC region, including the Fermi Bubbles (FBs; seen in gamma-rays), the eROSITA Bubbles (eBs; seen in X-rays), and the Loop I North Polar Spur (LNPS) association, an X-ray and radio feature within the northern eB. We use far-UV spectra from Hubble Space Telescope to measure LIV Si IV absorption in 61 AGN sight lines, of which 21 pass through the FBs, 53 pass through the eBs, and 18 pass through the LNPS. We also compare our measurements to those in the literature from sight lines covering the disk-halo interface and CGM. We find that the FBs and eBs have enhancements in measured columns of 0.22-0.29 dex in log. We also remove the contribution of a modeled disk and CGM component from the measured Si IV columns and find that the northern eB still retains a Si IV enhancement of 0.62 dex in log. A similar enhancement is not seen in the southern eB. Since the LNPS model-subtracted residuals show an enhancement compared to the rest of the northern eB of 0.69 dex, the northern eB enhancement may be caused by the LNPS.

  The Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS) is a proposed space-based X-ray telescope for detecting X-ray emissions from the hot gas content in our universe. With its unprecedented spatially-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy and large field of view, the HUBS mission will be uniquely qualified to measure the physical and chemical properties of the hot gas in the interstellar medium, the circumgalactic medium, the intergalactic medium, and the intracluster medium. These measurements will be valuable for two key scientific goals of HUBS, namely to unravel the AGN and stellar feedback physics that governs the formation and evolution of galaxies, and to probe the baryon budget and multi-phase states from galactic to cosmological scales. In addition to these two goals, the HUBS mission will also help us solve some problems in the fields of galaxy clusters, AGNs, diffuse X-ray backgrounds, supernova remnants, and compact objects. This paper discusses the perspective of advancing these fields using the HUBS telescope.

  Connections to Hidden Tidal Disruption Events and Changing-Look Active
  Galactic Nuclei

  We study the properties of galaxies hosting mid-infrared outbursts in the context of a catalog of five hundred thousand galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that nuclear obscuration, as inferred by the surrounding dust mass, does not correlate with host galaxy type, stellar properties (e.g. total mass and mean age), or with the extinction of the host galaxy as estimated by the Balmer decrement. This implies that nuclear obscuration cannot explain any over-representation of tidal disruption events in particular host galaxies. We identify a region in the galaxy catalog parameter space that contains all unobscured tidal disruption events but only harbors $\lesssim $ 9% of the mid-infrared outburst hosts. We find that mid-infrared outburst hosts appear more centrally concentrated and have higher galaxy S\'ersic indices than galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected using the BPT classification. We thus conclude that the majority of mid-infrared outbursts are not hidden tidal disruption events but are instead consistent with being obscured AGN that are highly variable, such as changing-look AGN.

  This study investigates the complex dynamics of AGN (Active Galactic Nucleus) jet-cloud interactions, particularly focusing on the impact of non-thermal particle acceleration on the resulting radiative signatures. We utilize advanced computational simulations, tracking changes in jet properties and emissions over a span of 0.2 Myr (millions of years). The research design incorporates the modeling of jet-cloud interactions, with a key focus on variations in the jet's density, velocity, and magnetic field. Findings reveal a two-fold increase in the magnetic field strength up to ~5 {\mu}G due to cloud incorporation, which, coupled with an elevated non-thermal particle population, enhances synchrotron emissions, shifting the spectral index from 2.2 to 2.4. Inverse Compton scattering saw a 30% increase within the first 0.125 Myr, reflecting in an abrupt X-ray and gamma-ray emissions spike. Furthermore, the jet's light curve flux variability in the X-ray band showcased an initial peak increase of about 28% by 0.175 Myr, settling to a 20% increase by 0.2 Myr, attributable to cloud disruption and absorption. Conclusions drawn from these findings confirm our hypothesis that non-thermal particle acceleration dramatically influences the radiative signatures of AGN jet-cloud interactions .It underscores the necessity of considering such acceleration processes in modeling AGN jet-cloud interactions and posits that these changes could be instrumental as observational indicators, thereby contributing to more accurate interpretations of AGN activity and evolution.
