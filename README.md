  We present CAPERS-LRD-z9, a little red dot (LRD) which we confirm to be a $z=9.288$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN). First identified as a high-redshift LRD candidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of CAPERS-LRD-z9 from the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) has revealed a broad $3500$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\beta$ emission line and narrow [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ lines, indicative of a BLAGN. Based on the broad H$\beta$ line, we compute a canonical black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})=7.58\pm0.15$, although full consideration of systematic uncertainties yields a conservative range of $6.65&lt;\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})&lt;8.50$. These observations suggest that either a massive black hole seed, or a lighter stellar remnant seed undergoing periods of super-Eddington accretion, is necessary to grow such a massive black hole in $\lesssim500$ Myr of cosmic time. CAPERS-LRD-z9 exhibits a strong Balmer break, consistent with a central AGN surrounded by dense ($\sim 10^{10}\textrm{ cm}^{-3}$) neutral gas. We model CAPERS-LRD-z9 using CLOUDY to fit the emission red-ward of the Balmer break with a dense gas-enshrouded AGN, and bagpipes to fit the rest-ultraviolet emission as a host-galaxy stellar population. This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy ($&lt;10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$) implies that the black-hole to stellar mass ratio may be extremely large, possibly $&gt;5\%$ (although systematic uncertainties on the black-hole mass prevent strong conclusions). However, the shape of the UV continuum differs from typical high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating that this UV emission may also be of AGN origin, and hence the true stellar mass of the host may be still lower.

  We present the results of VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopic observations of the Ly$\alpha\,$ emission nebulae associated with 11 high redshift ($z \geq 2.9$) radio galaxies (HzRGs) with DEC $&lt;25^{\circ}$. When considering the other nine sources with available archival MUSE data, these observations increase the coverage to half of the currently known HzRGs. For two sources we are unable to confirm the original identification, as no Ly$\alpha\,$ emission was detected. We produce narrow band images centered on the Ly$\alpha\,$ line, extract their nuclear spectra, map their ionized gas kinematics, and derive the Ly$\alpha\,$ surface brightness profiles (SBPs). The SBPs are generally well reproduced by an exponential law with a typical scale length of $\sim 20-30$ ckpc. We measure emission line ratios finding most sources in agreement with an AGN origin for their gas ionization, with a single object hinting at strong star formation. Regarding the connection between the radio and ionized gas emission, we find that while the Ly$\alpha\,$ nebulae are preferentially aligned with the direction of the radio emission, there is no clear correlation in terms of size or gas kinematics, and only a weak trend connecting their radio and Ly$\alpha\,$ luminosities. The alignment is most likely the result of anisotropic nuclear emission rather than of a direct impact of the jets into the ionized gas.

  Context. Elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $100~M_{\odot} \leq M_{\rm BH}\leq 2\times10^{5}~M_{\odot}$) can act as ``time-squeezing'' machines, enabling studies of AGN geometry through reverberation mapping (RM) on much shorter timescales than their supermassive siblings. Aims. The broad line region (BLR) radius constraints for IMBH candidates with different Eddington ratios probe the unexplored faint end of radius--luminosity ($R-L$) relations and allow us to build a robust $M_{\rm BH}$ estimator. This study aims to (a) confirm a rapidly accreting IMBH candidate; (b) demonstrate the feasibility of the first photometric BLR reverberation mapping (RM) campaign for this class of objects. Methods. The IMBH candidate J1448+16 was identified in the broad H$\alpha$-selected spectroscopic sample from SDSS. We carried out narrow-band H$\alpha$ and broad-band SDSS~g\'~monitoring to check small-scale variability and extract the time lag between the BLR and accretion disk (AD) continuum during 5 months (March--July 2024) using a 60-cm telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory. Results. We confirmed the candidate as an active IMBH using XMM-Newton as a bright X-ray point source with the photon index $\Gamma = 2.32^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$, suggesting the high accretion rate. From a combination of SDSS optical spectra and XMM-Newton observations, we estimate the black hole mass in the range $\sim 0.9-2.4~\times10^{5} M_{\odot}$ and the Eddington rate from $\sim 37-112\%$. We report high-amplitude $\sim 60\%$ intra-night ($\sim 2$~h) H$\alpha$ variability in this highly accreting IMBH. In addition, we extracted a tentative measurement of a BLR RM radius $\sim 1-8~\mathrm{days}$. Conclusions. This work is a proof of concept for further IMBH variability studies and BLR RM campaigns, which will be essential for the calibration of the $R-L$ relation at the faint end.

  We present one of the largest uniform optical spectroscopic surveys of X-ray selected sources to date that were observed as a pilot study for the Black Hole Mapper (BHM) survey. The BHM program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-V is designed to provide optical spectra for hundreds of thousands of X-ray selected sources from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. This significantly improves our ability to classify and characterise the physical properties of large statistical populations of X-ray emitting objects. Our sample consists of 13079 sources in the eROSITA eFEDS performance verification field, 12011 of which provide reliable redshifts from 0&lt;z&lt;5.8. The vast majority of these objects were detected as point-like sources (X-ray flux limit F(0.5-2 keV)&gt;6.5x10^-15 erg/s/cm^2) and were observed for about 20 years with fibre-fed SDSS spectrographs. After including all available redshift information for the eFEDS sources from the dedicated SDSS-V plate programme and archival data, we visually inspected the SDSS optical spectra to verify the reliability of these redshift measurements and the performance of the SDSS pipeline. The visual inspection allowed us to recover reliable redshifts (for 99% of the spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of &gt;2) and to assign classes to the sources, and we confirm that the vast majority of our sample consists of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Only ~3% of the eFEDS/SDSS sources are Galactic objects. We also show the diversity of the optical spectra of the X-ray selected AGNs and provide spectral stacks with a high signal-to-noise ratio in various sub-samples with different redshift and optical broad-band colours. Our AGN sample contains optical spectra of (broad-line) quasars, narrow-line galaxies, and optically passive galaxies. It is considerably diverse in its colours and in its levels of nuclear obscuration.
