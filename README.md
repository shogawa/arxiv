  We use resolved spectroscopy from MaNGA to investigate the significance of both local and global properties of galaxies to the cessation of star formation at kpc scales. Quenched regions are identified from a sample of isolated disk galaxies by a single-parameter criterion $\rm {D}_n(4000)$ - $\log$ $\rm {EW}({H\alpha})$$~&gt;1.6-\log 2=1.3$, and are divided into gas-rich quenched regions (GRQRs) and gas-poor quenched regions (GPQRs) according to the surface density of cold gas ($\rm \Sigma_{gas}$). Both types of quenched regions tend to be hosted by non-AGN galaxies with relatively high mass ($M_\ast$$\gtrsim 10^{10}M_\odot$) and red colors (${\rm NUV}-r \gtrsim 3$), as well as low star formation rate and high central density at fixed mass. They span wide ranges in other properties including structural parameters that are similar to the parent sample, indicating that the conditions responsible for quenching in gas-rich regions are largely independent on the global properties of galaxies. We train random forest (RF) classifiers and regressors for predicting quenching in our sample with 15 local/global properties. $\Sigma_\ast$ is the most important property for quenching except that should be considered as the results of quenching, especially for GRQRs. These results strongly indicate the important roles of low-mass hot evolved stars which are numerous and long-lived in quenched regions and can provide substantial radiation pressure to support the surrounding gas against gravitational collapse. The different feature importance for quenching as found previously by Bluck et al. (2020a,b) are partly due to the different definitions of quenched regions, particularly the different requirements on $\rm {EW}({H\alpha})$.

  We present galaxy MACS0416-Y1 at z$_{\rm{spec}} = 8.312$ as observed by the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). MACS0416-Y1 has been shown to have extreme dust properties, thus, we study the physical properties and star formation histories of its resolved components. Overall, we find that MACS0416-Y1 is undergoing a star formation burst in three resolved clumps. The central clump is less massive compared to the other clumps and possibly formed in the merging process of the two larger clumps. Although the star formation history indicates an ongoing star formation burst, this gas-rich galaxy shows comparable star formation efficiency to cosmic noon galaxies. Using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy, we measure metallicity, $12 +\log\rm{(O/H)} = 7.76\pm0.03$ , ionisation parameter, $\log U = -2.48\pm0.03$, and electron temperature $\rm{T}_e = 18000\pm 4000 K $. The emission line ratios of the galaxy indicate an evolved Interstellar medium (ISM) similar to $z\sim2$ star-forming galaxies. Further, we find possible presence of ionisation from an active galactic nuclei (AGN) using emission line diagnostics, however, we do not detect broad line component in H$\beta$ emission line. As this gas-rich galaxy is undergoing a major merger, we hypothesise that the high dust temperature in MACS0416-Y1 is caused by the star formation burst or a possible narrow-line AGN.

  We present millimeter observations of the host galaxy of the most distant blazar known, VLASSJ041009.05-013919.88 (hereafter J0410-0139) at z=7, using ALMA and NOEMA observations. The ALMA data reveal a 2e42 erg/s [CII] 158um emission line at z=6.9964 with a [CII]-inferred star-formation rate of 58 Msun/yr. We estimate a dynamical mass of 4.6e9 Msun, implying a black hole mass to host a dynamical mass ratio of 0.15. The 238 GHz continuum (rest-frame IR) decreased by ~33% from the NOEMA to the ALMA observations taken ~10 months apart. The VLA 3-10 GHz radio flux densities showed a ~37% decrease in a similar time frame, suggesting a causal connection. At face value, J0410-0139 would have the lowest [CII]-to-IR luminosity ratio of a z&gt;5.7 quasar reported to date (~1e-4). However, if only &lt;20% of the measured IR luminosity were due to thermal emission from dust, the [CII]-to-IR luminosity ratio would be typical of (U)LIRGS, and the star formation rates derived from [CII] and IR luminosities would be consistent. These results provide further evidence that synchrotron emission significantly contributes to the observed rest-frame IR emission of J0410-0139, similar to what has been reported in some radio-loud AGN at z&lt;1.

  Massive stars may form in or be captured into AGN disks. Recent 1D studies employing stellar-evolution codes have demonstrated the potential for rapid growth of such stars through accretion up to a few hundred $M_\odot$. We perform 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of moderately massive stars' envelopes, in order to determine the rate and critical radius $R_{\rm crit}$ of their accretion process in an isotropic gas-rich environment in the absence of luminosity-driven mass loss. We find that in the ``fast-diffusion" regime where characteristic radiative diffusion speed $c/\tau$ is faster than the gas sound speed $c_s$, the accretion rate is suppressed by feedback from gravitational and radiative advection energy flux, in addition to the stellar luminosity. Alternatively, in the ``slow-diffusion" regime where $c/\tau&lt;c_s$, due to adiabatic accretion, the stellar envelope expands quickly to become hydrostatic and further net accretion occurs on thermal timescales in the absence of self-gravity. When the radiation entropy of the medium is less than that of the star, however, this hydrostatic envelope can become more massive than the star itself. Within this sub-regime, self-gravity of the envelope excites runaway growth. Applying our results to realistic environments, moderately massive stars ($\lesssim 100M_\odot$) embedded in AGN disks typically accrete in the fast-diffusion regime, leading to reduction of steady-state accretion rate 1-2 orders of magnitudes lower than expected by previous 1D calculations and $R_{\rm crit}$ smaller than the disk scale height, except in the opacity window at temperature $T\sim 2000$K. Accretion in slow diffusion regime occurs in regions with very high density $\rho\gtrsim 10^{-9}$g/cm$^3$, and needs to be treated with caution in 1D long-term calculations.
