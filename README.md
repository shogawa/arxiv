  Variability studies have proven to be a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding the physics and properties of of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). They provide insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of the emitting regions, the structure and dynamics of the accretion disk, and the properties of the central black hole. Here, we have analysed the K-band spectral variability of the Seyfert 1.9/2 galaxy NGC4388 spanning five epochs over a period of ten years. We have performed spectral synthesis of the nuclear region and found that the contribution of warm dust (T~800K) declined by 88% during these 10 years. In the same period, the [CaVIII] coronal line decreased 61%, whereas BrG emission declined 35%. For the HeI and H2, we did not detect any significant variation beyond their uncertainties. Based on the time span of these changes, we estimate that the region where the warm dust is produced is smaller than 0.6pc, which suggests that this spectral feature comes from the innermost part of the region sampled, directly from the AGN torus. On the other hand, the bulk of [CaVIII] is produced in the inner ~2pc and the nuclear BrG region is more extended, spanning a region larger than 3pc. Lastly, HeI and H2 are even more external, with most of the emission probably being produced in the host galaxy rather than in the AGN. This is the first spectroscopic variability study in the NIR for an AGN where the central source is not directly visible.

  As a considerable investment of time from various telescope facilities were dedicated toward studying the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.2$, it so far remains one of the most extensively studied protocluster. We report here the latest results in this field, adding a new dimension to previous research on cluster formation at high redshift. Previous studies have reported a significant overdensity ($\delta\sim10$) of massive H$\alpha$ (+ [Nii]) -emitting galaxies in 3700 comoving Mpc$^3$. Many of these were previously considered to be dusty, active star-forming galaxies, given their rest-frame optical and infrared features. However, this study argues that a third of them are more likely to be "passively-evolving" galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGNs) rather than star-forming galaxies, given the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting including an AGN component. For their SED-based star formation rates to be valid, bulk of their H$\alpha$ + [Nii] emission should come from the central AGNs. This difference in interpretation between this work and past studies, including ours, is particularly supported by the recent deep Chandra X-ray observation. Furthermore, we have spectroscopically confirmed a quiescent nature for one of these AGNs, with its multiple stellar absorption lines but also low ionisation emission lines. This important update provides new insights into the role of AGNs in forming the cluster red sequence observed in the present-day universe.

  Dynamical perturbations from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries can increase the rates of tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, most previous work focuses on TDEs from the heavy black hole in the SMBH binary (SMBHB) system. In this work, we focus on the lighter black holes in SMBHB systems and show that they can experience a similarly dramatic increase in their TDE rate due to perturbations from a more massive companion. While the increase in TDEs around the more massive black hole is mostly due to chaotic orbital perturbations, we find that, around the smaller black hole, the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism is dominant and capable of producing a comparably large number of TDEs. In this instance, the mass derived from the light curve and spectra of TDEs triggered by the lighter SMBH companion are expected to be significant smaller than the SMBH mass estimated from galaxy scaling relations, which are dominated by the more massive companion. This apparent inconsistency can help find SMBHB candidates that are not currently accreting as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and that are at separations too small to be resolved as two distinct sources. TDEs thus provide us with an exciting opportunity to study SMBHB, in particular when they might be detected from galaxies hosting SMBHs that are too massive to disrupt sun-like stars.
