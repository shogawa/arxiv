  Radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with their jets pointed close to our line of sight constitute the majority of extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources and significantly contribute to the radiation observed in the even higher energy regime. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is expected to detect fainter TeV objects, leading to an anticipated increase in the proportion of non-blazar extragalactic high-energy sources. Here we present the results of our dual-frequency (1.7 and 5~GHz) European VLBI Network (EVN) and enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) observations of two faint radio sources from the list of TeV candidate sources. They do not show signs of nuclear activity in their optical spectra, but they were hypothesized to contain faint AGN that is outshone by the host galaxy. We used the mas-scale resolution radio data to try to pinpoint the location of the compact radio emitting feature, determine its spectral index, radio power, brightness temperature and radio-X-ray luminosity ratio and thus identify the origin of the radio emission. Our results suggest that both optically passive-looking galaxies host faint compact radio-emitting AGN with steep spectra.

  We analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging of eight low-mass galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) identified via their photometric variability in \cite{baldassare_search_2020}.   We use GALFIT to model the 2D galaxy light profiles, and find a diversity of morphologies.   The galaxies with regular morphologies are best fit with pseudo-bulges and disks, rather than classical bulges. We estimate black hole masses using scaling relations and find black hole masses of 10$^{3.7-6.6}$ M$_\odot$. We compare this sample to dwarf galaxies with AGN selected via optical spectroscopy. On average, the variable host galaxies have lower mass black holes. We analyze the brightest point source in each galaxy and find their properties are not entirely consistent with star clusters, indicating that they are likely AGN. These point sources are found to have lower luminosities than spectroscopically selected dwarf AGN, but brighter than the point sources in dwarf galaxies not identified as AGN. Our detailed imaging analysis shows that variability selection has the potential to find lower mass black holes and lower luminosity AGN than optical spectroscopy. These active dwarfs may have been missed by spectroscopic searches due to star formation dilution or low gas content.

  Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy number density, making them critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. However, typical dwarfs are too faint to be visible outside the very local Universe in past surveys like the SDSS, which offer large footprints but are shallow. Dwarfs in such surveys have relatively high star formation rates, which boost their luminosity, making them detectable in shallow surveys, but also biased and potentially unrepresentative of dwarfs as a whole. Here, we use deep data to perform an unbiased statistical study of ~7,000 nearby (z&lt;0.25) dwarfs (10^8 MSun &lt; M &lt; 10^9.5 MSun) in the COSMOS field which, at these redshifts, is a relatively low-density field. At z~0.05, ~40 per cent of dwarfs in low-density environments are red/quenched, falling to ~30 per cent by z~0.25. Red dwarfs reside closer to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies. Proximity to a massive galaxy appears to be more important in determining whether a dwarf is red, rather than simply its distance from nodes and filaments or the mean density of its local environment. Interestingly, around half of the red dwarfs reside outside the virial radii of massive galaxies and around a third of those also inhabit regions in the lower 50 per cent in density percentile (i.e. regions of very low ambient density). Around half of the red dwarf population is, therefore, quenched by mechanisms unrelated to environment, which are likely to be internal processes such as stellar and AGN feedback.
