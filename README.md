We present the first spatially resolved investigation of near-infrared coronal lines in dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy. Coronal lines (CLs), which are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species with ionization potentials up to 450 eV, act as sensitive tracers of the AGN ionizing continuum and feedback processes. Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component (W$_{80}$ &gt; 300 km/s). If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution.

Radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising mechanism for powering disc winds from accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, overionization reduces line opacity and quenches the line force, which suppresses outflows. Here, we show that small-scale clumping can resolve this problem. Adopting the microclumping approximation, our new simulations demonstrate that even modest volume filling factors ($f_V \sim 0.1-0.01$) can dramatically increase the wind mass-loss rate by lowering its ionization state -- raising $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}$ and yielding $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-4}$ for such modest filling factors. Clumpy wind models produce the UV resonance lines that are absent from smooth wind models. They can also reprocess a significant fraction of the disc luminosity and thus dramatically modify the broad-band optical/UV SED. Given that theory and observations indicate that disc winds are intrinsically inhomogeneous, clumping offers a physically motivated solution. Together, these results provide the first robust, self-consistent demonstration that clumping can reconcile line-driven wind theory with observations across AWDs and AGNs.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.

We present a systematic investigation of long-term mid-infrared (MIR) color variability in 1,718 Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) using 14-year \textit{WISE}/NEOWISE monitoring data. Through Pearson correlation analysis between photometric magnitude and color, we identify: (1) a radio-quiet NLSy1 (RQ-NLSy1) population comprising 230 bluer-when-brighter (BWB) sources, 131 redder-when-brighter (RWB) sources, and 1,323 objects showing weak or statistically insignificant color variations; and (2) a radio-loud NLSy1 (RL-NLSy1) population containing 5 BWBs, 2 RWBs, and 27 sources with weak/no color variations. Our analysis reveals that the BWB tendency strengthens significantly in galaxies with redder mean MIR colors $\rm \left&lt;W1-W2\right&gt;$ and lower starlight contamination. Furthermore, this color-change pattern demonstrates that the most bolometric luminous sources exhibit the most pronounced BWB behavior. While similar trends exist for black hole mass and Eddington ratio, bolometric luminosity appears to be the primary physical driver. Potential origins of these variations (e.g., host galaxy contribution, accretion disk variability, and dust reprocessing) are discussed. We conclude that temperature-dependent dust reprocessing dominates the observed BWB, RWB, and no/weak variation patterns. This interpretation may also apply to similar MIR color variations observed in other extragalactic MIR transients, such as tidal disruption events, ambiguous nuclear transients, and changing-look AGNs. In addition, we find no significant difference in long-term MIR color variations between RL-NLSy1s and RQ-NLSy1s, however, RL-NLSy1s show significantly greater dispersion in intrinsic variability amplitude compared to RQ-NLSy1s due to jet-induced complexity, where non-thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic jets obscures thermal dust signatures.

We aim to investigate the interplay between dense molecular gas, star formation, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) NGC 1068 at sub-kiloparsec scales. We present the HCN (4-3) and HCO$^+$ (4-3) maps of NGC 1068, obtained with JCMT as part of the Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies (MALATANG) project, and perform spatially resolved analyses of their correlations with infrared luminosity and soft X-ray emission. Spatially resolved relations between the luminosities of infrared dust emission and dense molecular gas tracers ($L_{\rm IR}-L'_{\rm dense}$) are found to be nearly linear, without clear evidence of excess contributions from AGN activity. The spatially resolved X-ray emission ($L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$) displays a radially-dependent twofold correlation with the star formation rate (SFR), suggesting distinct gas-heating mechanisms between the galaxy center and the outer regions. A super-linear scaling is obtained in galactic center regions with SFR surface density ($Σ_{\rm SFR}$) $&gt;$ 8.2 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$: log($L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$/erg s$^{-1}$) = 2.2 log(SFR/$M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) + 39.1. We further found a statistically significant super-linear correlation ($β= 1.34$ $\pm$ 0.86) between $L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$/SFR and HCN(4-3)/CO(1-0) intensity ratio, whereas no such trend is seen for HCO$^+$(4-3)/CO(1-0) or CO(3-2)/CO(1-0). These findings indicate that AGN feedback does not dominate star formation regulation on sub-kiloparsec scales, and that the excitation of dense gas traced by HCN (4-3) may be more directly influenced by high-energy feedback processes compared to HCO$^+$ (4-3) and CO (3-2).

We investigate the stellar velocity dispersion functions (VDFs) of pressure-supported galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological simulations. The central stellar velocity dispersion is one of the fundamental dynamical tracers of the total mass of galaxy subhalos, alongside luminosity and stellar mass. Because it reflects the gravitational potential, the stellar velocity dispersion is expected to be relatively insensitive to feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a critical process that regulates the connection between other galaxy observables and subhalo mass. To examine the impact of AGN feedback, we analyze the VDFs from five EAGLE simulation runs, each adopting a different AGN feedback model: one "standard", two "enhanced", one "reduced", and one with no AGN feedback. We compute the stellar velocity dispersions of pressure-supported galaxies using member stellar particles, mimicking fiber spectroscopy. The VDFs from the standard and enhanced AGN feedback models show little difference. However, contrary to our initial expectation that the VDF shape would be largely insensitive to AGN feedback, the simulations with reduced and no AGN feedback show a significant excess of high velocity dispersion galaxies ($σ_{*}$ &gt; 200 km s$^{-1}$) and a deficit of low dispersion galaxies (100 &lt; $σ_{*}$ (km s$^{-1}$) &lt; 200), compared to those with standard or enhanced AGN feedback. The presence of high velocity dispersion galaxies in the no-AGN model arises from enhanced central star formation, due to the absence of AGN-driven gas heating or expulsion. Our results demonstrate that the shape of the theoretical VDF is sensitive to the strength of AGN feedback. These predictions offer a theoretical benchmark for future observational studies of the galaxy velocity dispersion function using large-scale spectroscopic surveys.  

A Black-Hole Envelope Interpretation for Cosmological Demographics of Little Red Dots

Little red dots (LRDs) newly discovered with JWST are active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may represent black hole (BH) growth at the earliest cosmic epochs. These sources show puzzling features unlike typical AGNs, including red optical continua, weak hot-dust emission, and a lack of detectable X-rays. Previously, LRDs have often been interpreted as dust-reddened AGNs, leading to severe inconsistencies with the luminosity and BH mass densities inferred for previously known AGNs over $0&lt;z&lt;5$. The BH-envelope (BHE) model has been proposed to explain these characteristics, in which an accreting BH is enshrouded by a dense, optically thick gaseous envelope. In this Letter, we reanalyze the SEDs of $\sim 400$ photometric LRDs in the COSMOS-Web survey using the BHE model and reassess their implications for cosmological BH evolution. We find that the optical-NIR spectra of LRDs are well reproduced by blackbody emission with an effective temperatures of $4000-6000~\K$. Within the BHE framework, the inferred bolometric luminosities decrease by $\gtrsim1-2$ orders of magnitude compared to dust-reddened AGN assumptions. As a result, the revised luminosity function, BH accretion density, and BH mass function become consistent with those of AGNs at $z&lt;5$. The stellar masses of LRD hosts are estimated by attributing the UV excesses to star formation. Although the resulting $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratio remains higher than the local empirical value, the excess is modest. Overall, the BHE model not only resolves the spectral features of LRDs but also brings their statistical properties into agreement with the broader cosmological BH population.
