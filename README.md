  The mid-infrared spectra of galaxies are rich in features such as the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) and silicate dust features which give valuable information about the physics of galaxies and their evolution. For example they can provide information about the relative contribution of star formation and accretion from a supermassive black hole to the power output of galaxies. However, the mid-infrared spectra are currently available for a very small fraction of galaxies that have been detected in deep multi-wavelength surveys of the sky. In this paper we explore whether Deep Generative Network methods can be used to reconstruct mid-infrared spectra in the 5-35{\mu}m range using the limited multi-wavelength photometry in ~20 bands from the ultraviolet to the submillimeter which is typically available in extragalactic surveys. For this purpose we use simulated spectra computed with a combination of radiative transfer models for starbursts, active galactic nucleus (AGN) tori and host galaxies. We find that our method using Deep Generative Networks, namely Generative Adversarial Networks and Generative Latent Optimization models, can efficiently produce high quality reconstructions of mid-infrared spectra in ~70% of the cases.

  Context: Atomic and molecular lines in galaxies offer insights into energy budgets and feedback mechanisms. Aims: This study establishes a new framework for interpreting these lines and deducing energy budgets from observations. Methods: Atomic and molecular lines detected in a given object are assumed to result from the combination of distributions of shocks and photo-dissociation regions (PDR). Using the Paris-Durham shock code and the Meudon PDR code, emissions are computed over a wide range of parameters. Total emissions are calculated using probability distribution functions, with a defined distance metric based on observed and predicted intensity ratios. Results: We analyze the radio galaxy 3C 326 N, finding both shocks and PDRs necessary to explain the line fluxes. Viable solutions occur only at low densities ($\rm n_H &lt; 100 cm^{-3}$), indicating emission from diffuse interstellar matter. The optimal solution involves low-velocity shocks (5-20 km/s) in PDRs illuminated by UV radiation ten times stronger than in the solar neighborhood. The H$2$ 0-0 S(0) $28 \mu$m, [CII] $158 \mu$m, and [OI] $63 \mu$m lines originate from PDRs, while other H$2$ lines mostly come from shocks. The reprocessed radiative and mechanical energies are $\rm {L_{UV} = 6.3\times10^9 L\odot}$ and $\rm {L_K = 3.9\times10^8 L_\odot}$, respectively, in agreement with 3C 326 N's infrared luminosity, and consistent with 1% of the AGN jet kinetic power dissipated in the interstellar medium. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the radiative and mechanical energy budgets of galaxies can be derived from observations of atomic and molecular lines alone. It highlights the unexpected importance of the diffuse medium for 3C 326 N. Comparison with new JWST data for 3C 326 N shows striking agreement, opening new prospects for predicting and interpreting extragalactic observations.   

A hidden population of active galactic nuclei can explain the
  overabundance of luminous $z&gt;10$ objects observed by JWST

  The first wave of observations with JWST has revealed a striking overabundance of luminous galaxies at early times ($z&gt;10$) compared to models of galaxies calibrated to pre-JWST data. Early observations have also uncovered a large population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z&gt;6$. Because many of the high-$z$ objects appear extended, the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to the total luminosity has been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we use a semi-empirical model for assigning AGNs to galaxies to show that active galaxies can boost the stellar luminosity function (LF) enough to solve the overabundance problem while simultaneously remaining consistent with the observed morphologies of high-$z$ sources. We construct a model for the composite AGN+galaxy LF by connecting dark matter halo masses to galaxy and SMBH masses and luminosities, accounting for dispersion in the mapping between host galaxy and SMBH mass and luminosity. By calibrating the model parameters -- which characterize the $M_\bullet-M_\star$ relation -- to a compilation of $z&gt;10$ JWST UVLF data, we show that AGN emission can account for the excess luminosity under a variety of scenarios, including one where 10\% of galaxies host BHs of comparable luminosities to their stellar components. Using a sample of simulated objects and real observations, we demonstrate that such low-luminosity AGNs can be `hidden' in their host galaxies and be missed in common morphological analyses. We find that for this explanation to be viable, our model requires a population of BHs that are overmassive ($M_\bullet/M_\star\sim10^{-2}$) with respect to their host galaxies compared to the local relation and are more consistent with the observed relation at $z=4-8$. We explore the implications of this model for BH seed properties and comment on observational diagnostics necessary to further investigate this explanation.

  Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting has been extensively used to determine the nature of the faint radio source population. Recent efforts have combined fits from multiple SED-fitting codes to account for the host galaxy and any active nucleus that may be present. We show that it is possible to produce similar-quality classifications using a single energy-balance SED fitting code, Prospector, to model up to 26 bands of UV$-$far-infrared aperture-matched photometry for $\sim$31,000 sources in the ELAIS-N1 field from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Deep fields first data release. One of a new generation of SED-fitting codes, Prospector accounts for potential contributions from radiative active galactic nuclei (AGN) when estimating galaxy properties, including star formation rates (SFRs) derived using non-parametric star formation histories. Combining this information with radio luminosities, we classify 92 per cent of the radio sources as a star-forming galaxy, high/low-excitation radio galaxy, or radio-quiet AGN and study the population demographics as a function of 150 MHz flux density, luminosity, SFR, stellar mass, redshift and apparent $r$-band magnitude. Finally, we use Prospector SED fits to investigate the SFR$-$150 MHz luminosity relation for a sample of $\sim$$133,000~3.6~\mu$m-selected $z&lt;1$ sources, finding that the stellar mass dependence is significantly weaker than previously reported, and may disappear altogether at $\log_{10} (\mathrm{SFR}/M_\odot~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) &gt; 0.5$. This approach makes it significantly easier to classify radio sources from LoTSS and elsewhere, and may have important implications for future studies of star-forming galaxies at radio wavelengths.
