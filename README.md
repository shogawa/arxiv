  We study the stellar mass-gas metallicity relation (MZR) which shows a significant scatter for a fixed stellar mass. By defining global environments, nodes, filaments, and voids within the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we explore when and where the enrichment of galaxies occurs, analysing key evolution parameters such as star-formation rate and changes in gas-fraction and gas-metallicity per unit time. At high redshift ($z&gt;4.5$), there are minimal deviations from the MZR due to environment, however, larger deviations emerge as redshift decreases. Low stellar mass galaxies in nodes, $M_{\star} &lt; 10^{9.8}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$, start showing deviations at $z = 3.5$, whilst other environments do not. For, $z &lt; 2$, filaments and voids begin to show deviations above and below the MZR, respectively. By $z = 0.625$, the last epoch of HR5, deviations exist for all stellar masses and environments, with a maximum value of 0.13 dex at $M_{\star} \approx 10^{9.35}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$, between the median gas metallicities of node and void galaxies. To explain this environmental variance we discuss gas accretion, AGN, ram-pressure-stripping and strangulation as regulators of $Z_{g}$. Concurrently, at high metallicities, for $z &lt; 2$, while massive galaxies in nodes show increasing $Z_{g}$ and decreasing [O/Fe], void galaxies show a turnover where $Z_{g}$ falls with decreasing [O/Fe]. This directly points to the importance of cold-gas accretion in retaining lower $Z_{g}$ in massive void galaxies for $z &lt; 2$, whilst its absence in nodes allowed $Z_{g}$ to access higher values.

  We present a catalog of 927 low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with black hole mass of $M_{BH}\leqslant2\times10^{6} M_{\odot}$ characterized by broad H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ emission lines,uniformly selected from the Seventeenth Data Release (DR17) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra. Taking advantages of the wide wavelength coverage of BOSS/eBOSS spectra of the SDSS, this sample significantly extends the redshift range to $z\leqslant0.57$, a marked improvement over the previous studies which were generally limited to $z\leqslant0.35$. This sample encompasses black hole masses from $10^{3.7}$ to $10^{6.3} M_{\odot}$, with Eddington ratios ranging from 0.01 to 3.3. Preliminary analysis of this sample reveals a marked decline in maximum accretion rates (namely $L/L_{Edd}$) and broad-H$\alpha$ luminosities with decreasing redshift, analogous to the passive ``downsizing'' evolutionary trend observed in high-mass AGNs. This systematic catalog of low-redshift low-mass AGNs, the largest so far, will benefit the studies on accretion physics, AGN--galaxy connection and the origin of supermassive black holes.

  We investigate the Missing Baryon problem using Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to trace cosmic baryons. We use the CROCODILE simulations with the GADGET3/4-OSAKA SPH code, incorporating star formation, supernova (SN), and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Light cones generated from large-scale structure simulations allow us to compute gas density profiles and dispersion measures (DMs) measurable by FRBs. Our results show that AGN feedback reduces central gas densities in halos, reshaping the boundary between the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). Zoom-in simulations further reveal that AGN feedback significantly modulates foreground halo DM contributions along different sightlines. By analyzing the DM--redshift (DM--z) relation and comparing it to the Macquart relation, we constrain the diffuse baryon mass fraction at z = 1 to fdiff = 0.865 (+0.101, -0.165) (fiducial) and fdiff = 0.856 (+0.101, -0.162) (NoBH), including IGM (fIGM) and halo (fHalos) contributions. We also quantify the redshift evolution of fdiff and fIGM, providing the fitting results. Our study provides a framework for understanding baryon distribution across cosmic structures, FRB host galaxies, and the role of AGN in shaping foreground DM contributions.

  Gas flows between galaxies and the CGM play a crucial role in galaxy evolution. When ionized by a quasar, these gas flows can be directly traced as giant nebulae. We present a study of a giant nebula around a radio-loud quasar, 3C$\,$57 at $z\approx0.672$. Observations from MUSE reveal that the nebula is elongated with a major axis of $70 \, \rm kpc$ and a minor axis of $40 \, \rm kpc$. The nebula displays an approximately symmetric blueshifted-redshifted pattern along the major axis and multi-component emission features in its $\rm[O\,II]$ and $\rm [O\,III]$ profiles. The morphology and kinematics can be explained as rotating gas or biconical outflow, both of which qualitatively reproduce the observed position-velocity diagram. The 3C$\,$57 nebula is significantly more kinematically disturbed, with $\rm W_{80}$ (the line width encompassing 80$\%$ of the flux) of approximately $300{-}400\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, compared to $\rm H\,I$ gas in local early-type galaxies, which typically shows $\rm W_{80} \approx 50\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. This velocity dispersion is comparable to the gas in cool-core clusters despite originating in a group 100 times less massive. For biconical outflow models, the inferred $10{-}20^{\circ}$ inclination angle is in tension with the unobscured nature of the quasar, as the dusty torus is expected to be perpendicular to the outflow. Neither a quiescent rotating gas origin nor a biconical outflow fully reproduces the observed kinematics and morphology of the 3C$\,$57 nebula, suggesting a more intricate origin likely involving both rotation and AGN feedback.   

The relativistic outflow driven by the large-scale magnetic field from

  Outflows/jets are ubiquitous in a wide range of astrophysical objects, yet the mechanisms responsible for their generation remain elusive. One hypothesis is that they are magnetically driven. Based on general relativistic MHD equations, we establish a formulation to describe the outflows driven by large-scale magnetic fields from the accretion disk in Schwarzschild spacetime. The outflow solution manifests as a contour level of a ``Bernoulli" function, which is determined by ensuring that it passes through both the slow and fast magnetosonic points. This approach is a general relativistic extension to the classical treatment of Cao and Spruit (1994). The initial plasma $\beta$ that permits magnetically driven outflow solutions is constrained, with the slow magnetosonic point above the footpoint setting an upper limit ($\beta_\mathrm{b}\lesssim 2$) and the Alfv\'en point inside the light cylinder setting a lower limit ($\beta_\mathrm{b}\gtrsim 0.02$). The higher the magnetization, the higher the temperature allowed, leading to relativistic outflows/jets. We investigate the relativistic outflows/jets of several typical objects such as active galactic nuclei (AGN), X-ray binaries (XRBs) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The results indicate that all of these phenomena require strongly magnetized, high-temperature outflows as initial conditions, suggesting a potential association between the production of relativistic outflows/jets and corona-like structures.

  JWST spectroscopy has revealed a population of compact objects at redshifts $z=2$-9 with `v'-shaped spectral energy distributions, broad permitted lines, and, often, hydrogen Balmer absorption. Among these `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), Abell2744-QSO1 at $z=7.04$ has been confirmed to have time-variable equivalent width (EW) in its broad emission lines, confirming its AGN nature. We extend the analysis of NIRSpec/IFS data from the BlackTHUNDER survey to the H$\alpha$ line. The broad-line profile in Abell2744-QSO1 is manifestly non-Gaussian, requiring at least two Gaussian components with full width at half maximum FWHM=$450\pm50$ and $1800\pm100$ km s$^{-1}$. Crucially, we also detect a narrow-line Gaussian component, and strong H$\alpha$ absorption (EW relative to the continuum $\approx 30^{+15}_{-9}$ A), confirming a connection between the strong Balmer break and line absorption. The absorber is at rest with respect to broad H$\alpha$, suggesting that the gas cannot be interpreted as an inflow or outflow, forming instead a long-lived structure. Its velocity dispersion is $\sigma_{abs} = 100\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with the value inferred from the analysis of the Balmer break. Based on H$\alpha$, we infer a black hole mass of log(M$_{BH}$/M$_\odot$)=6.3-6.7, 0.9-1.3 dex smaller than previous estimates based on H$\beta$. The Eddington ratio is 0.7-1.6. Combining the high signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow H$\alpha$ line with the spectral resolution R=3,700 of the G395H grating, we infer a narrow-line dispersion $\sigma_n = 22^{+5}_{-6}$ km s$^{-1}$, which places a stringent constraint on the black-hole-to-dynamical-mass ratio of this system to be M$_{BH}$/M$_{dyn}$&gt;0.02-0.4. If M$_{BH}$ is near the low-mass end of our estimates, the SMBH would be accreting at a super-Eddington rate. Alternatively, at the high-M$_{BH}$ end, there would be minimal room for a host galaxy.

  We show that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna can uniquely identify the sites of intermediate-mass binary black hole (IMBBH) mergers if they occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks with a gas density $\rho\geq10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$ via measurement of dynamical friction effect in the gravitational waveform. We find that even a single observation of a gravitational wave source with a total mass of $10^3 M_{\odot}$ and a mass ratio of 2 at a luminosity distance of 3 Gpc is sufficient to confidently associate the merger to be in an AGN disk with a density $\sim 10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$, as it allows estimation of the density with an error bar ${\cal O}(100\%)$. This provides a new way of inferring AGN disk densities that complement traditional X-ray observations. Further, we find that neglecting the presence of environmental effects in the waveform models used for parameter estimation can bias the chirp mass, mass ratio and arrival time of a merger. If not corrected, this can significantly impact our ability to carry out multiband data analysis of IMBBHs that combines information from LISA and the ground-based gravitational wave detectors.
