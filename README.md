  Galaxy mergers are expected to play a key role in the evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). An observational signature of this phenomenon is the detection of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) amongst merging systems, as predicted by cosmological models of structure formation. Dual AGNs at sub-kiloparsec-scale separation are the precursors of merging black hole binaries, an important source of gravitational waves, but a paucity of such systems have been confirmed to date by direct imaging, while other similar claims have been strongly disputed. Here we report the serendipitous multiwavelength discovery of a dual black hole system with a separation of ~100 pc, in the gas-rich luminous infrared galaxy MCG-03-34-64 (z=0.016). Chandra/ACIS imaging shows two spatially-resolved peaks of equal intensity in the neutral Fe Ka emission line, consistent with a dual SMBH, which is supported by Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Very Large Array (VLA) observations. The separation of ~100 pc is the closest dual AGN separation reported to date with spatially-resolved, multiwavelength observations.

  We adopt a Bayesian X-ray spectral approach to investigate the accretion properties of unobscured ($20&lt;\log(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}&lt;22$) and obscured ($22&lt; \log(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}&lt;24$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) to shed light on the orientation vs evolution scenarios for the origin of the obscuring material. For a sample of 3882 X-ray-selected AGN from the Chandra COSMOS Legacy, AEGIS and CDFS extragalactic surveys, we constrain their stellar masses, $M_\star$, intrinsic X-ray luminosities, $L_{\rm X}$, obscuring column densities, $N_{\rm H}$, and specific accretion rates $\lambda\propto L_{\rm X}/M_\star$. By combining these observables within a Bayesian non-parametric approach, we infer, for the first time, the specific accretion rate distribution (SARD) of obscured and unobscured AGN to $z\approx3$, i.e. the probability of a galaxy with mass $M_\star$ at redshift $z$ hosting an AGN with column density $N_{\rm H}$ and specific accretion rate $\lambda$. Our findings indicate that (1) both obscured and unobscured SARDs share similar shapes, shifting towards higher accretion rates with redshift, (2) unobscured SARDs exhibit a systematic offset towards higher $\lambda$ compared to obscured SARD for all redshift intervals, (3) the obscured AGN fraction declines sharply at $\log\lambda_{\rm break} \sim-2$ for $z &lt;0.5$, but shifts to higher $\lambda$ values with increasing redshift, (4) the incidence of AGN within the theoretically unstable blow-out region of the $\lambda-N_{\rm H}$ plane increases with redshift. These observations provide compelling evidence for AGN "downsizing" and radiation-regulated nuclear-scale obscuration with an increasing host galaxy contribution towards higher redshifts.

  X-ray obscuration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered in the context of ionized winds of stratified structure launched from accretion disks. We argue that a Compton-thick layer of a large-scale disk wind can obscure continuum X-rays and also lead to broad UV absorption such as in the blue wing of Civ; the former originates from the inner wind while the latter from the outer wind as a dual role. Motivated by a number of observational evidence showing strong AGN obscuration phenomena in Seyfert 1 AGNs, we demonstrate in this work, by utilizing a physically-motivated wind model coupled to post-process radiative transfer calculations, that an extended disk wind under certain physical conditions (e.g. morphology and density) could naturally cause a sufficient obscuration qualitatively consistent with UV/X-ray observations. Predicted UV/X-ray correlation is also presented as a consequence of variable spatial size of the wind in this scenario.   

A novel Bayesian approach for decomposing the radio emission of quasars:

  Studies show that both radio jets from the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the star formation (SF) activity in quasar host galaxies contribute to the quasar radio emission; yet their relative contributions across the population remain unclear. Here, we present an improved parametric model that allows us to statistically separate the SF and AGN components in observed quasar radio flux density distributions, and investigate how their relative contributions evolve with AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_\mathrm{bol}$) and redshift ($z$) using a fully Bayesian method. Based on the newest data from LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey Data Release 2, our model gives robust fitting results out to $z\sim4$, showing a quasar host galaxy SFR evolution that increases with bolometric luminosity and with redshift out to $z\sim4$. This differs from the global cosmic SFR density, perhaps due to the importance of galaxy mergers. The prevalence of radio AGN emissions increases with quasar luminosity, but has little dependence on redshift. Furthermore, our new methodology and large sample size allow us to subdivide our dataset to investigate the role of other parameters. Specifically, in this paper, we explore quasar colour and demonstrate that the radio excess in red quasars is due to an enhancement in AGN-related emission, since the host galaxy SF contribution to the total radio emission is independent of quasar colour. We also find evidence that this radio enhancement occurs mostly in quasars with weak or intermediate radio power.   

Scrutinising evidence for the triggering of Active Galactic Nuclei in

  Environmental effects are believed to play an important yet poorly understood role in triggering accretion events onto the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of galaxies (Active Galactic Nuclei; AGN). Massive clusters, which represent the densest structures in the Universe, provide an excellent laboratory to isolate environmental effects and study their impact on black hole growth. In this work, we critically review observational evidence for the preferential activation of SMBHs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. We develop a semi-empirical model under the assumption that the incidence of AGN in galaxies is independent of environment. We demonstrate that the model is broadly consistent with recent observations on the AGN halo occupation at $z=0.2$, although it may overpredict satellite AGN in massive halos at that low redshift. We then use this model to interpret the projected radial distribution of X-ray sources around high redshift ($z\approx1$) massive ($&gt;5 \times 10^{14} \, M_\odot$) clusters, which show excess counts outside their virial radius. Such an excess naturally arises in our model as a result of sample variance. Up to 20% of the simulated projected radial distributions show excess counts similar to the observations, which are however, because of background/foreground AGN and hence, not physically associated with the cluster. Our analysis emphasises the importance of projection effects and shows that current observations of $z\approx1$ clusters remain inconclusive on the activation of SMBHs during infall.
