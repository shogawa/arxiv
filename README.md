  The active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are widely believed to be one of the promising acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (CRs). Essentially, AGNs are powered by the gravitational energy of matter falling to supermassive black holes. However, the conversion efficiency of gravitational to kinetic energy of CRs in AGNs, which is defined as baryon loading factor $\eta_p$, is not well known yet. After being accelerated, high-energy CRs could escape the host galaxy and enter the intra-cluster medium (ICM). These CRs can be confined within the galaxy cluster and produce $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos through proton-proton collisions with the ICM. In this paper, we study the diffusion of CRs in galaxy clusters and calculate the diffuse neutrino flux from galaxy cluster population. Using the latest upper limits on the cumulative unresolved TeV-PeV neutrino flux from galaxy clusters posed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we derive the upper limit of the average baryon loading factor as $\eta_{p,\mathrm{grav}} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-3} - 0.1$ for the population of galaxy clusters. This constraint is more stringent than the one obtained from $\gamma$-ray observation on the Coma cluster.

  Context. Multiwavelength studies of transients in actively accreting supermassive black holes have revealed that large-amplitude variability is frequently linked to significant changes in the optical spectra -- a phenomenon referred to as changing-look AGN (CLAGN).   Aim. In 2020, the Zwicky Transient Facility detected a transient flaring event in the type-1.9 AGN 6dFGS~gJ042838.8-000040, wherein a sharp increase in magnitude of $\sim$0.55 and $\sim$0.3 in the $g$- and $r$-bands, respectively, occurred over $\sim$40 days. Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA also observed the object in X-rays as part of its all-sky survey, but only after the flare had started decaying.   Methods. We performed a three-year, multiwavelength follow-up campaign of the source to track its spectral and temporal characteristics. This campaign included multiple ground-based facilities for optical spectroscopic monitoring and space-based observatories including \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{Swift} for X-ray and UV observations.   Results. An optical spectrum taken immediately after the peak revealed a changing-look event wherein the source had transitioned from type 1.9 to 1, with the appearance of a double-peaked broad H$\beta$ line and a blue continuum, both absent in an archival spectrum from 2005. The X-ray emission exhibits dramatic flux variation: a factor of $\sim$17, but with no spectral evolution, as the power-law photon index remained $\sim$1.9. There is no evidence of a soft X-ray excess. Overall the object exhibits no apparent signatures of a tidal disruption event.   Conclusions. The transient event was likely triggered by a disk instability in a pre-existing accretion flow, culminating in the observed multi-wavelength variability and CLAGN event.   

The impermanent fate of massive stars in AGN disks

  Stars are likely to form or to be captured in AGN disks. Their mass reaches an equilibrium when their rate of accretion is balanced by that of wind. If the exchanged gas is well mixed with the stellar core, this metabolic process would indefinitely sustain an "immortal" state on the main sequence (MS) and pollute the disk with He byproducts. This theoretical extrapolation is inconsistent with the super-solar {\alpha} element and Fe abundances inferred from the broad emission lines in active AGNs with modest He concentration. We show this paradox can be resolved with a highly-efficient retention of the He ashes or the suppression of chemical blending. The latter mechanism is robust in the geometrically-thin, dense, sub-pc regions of the disk where the embedded-stars' mass is limited by the gap-formation condition. These stars contain a radiative zone between their mass-exchange stellar surface and the nuclear-burning core. Insulation of the core lead to the gradual decrease of its H fuel and the stars' equilibrium masses. These stars transition to their post-main-sequence (PostMS) tracks on a chemical evolution time scale of a few Myr. Subsequently, the triple-{\alpha} and {\alpha}-chain reactions generate {\alpha} and Fe byproducts which are released into their natal disks. These PostMS stars also undergo core collapse, set off type II supernova, and leave behind a few solar-mass residual black holes or neutron stars
