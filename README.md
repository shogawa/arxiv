  Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs) are heavily obscured infrared cores that have been found in local (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). They show bright emission from vibrationally excited rotational transitions of HCN, known as HCN-vib, and are thought to harbor Compton Thick (CT, $N_{\text{H}} \geq 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) or extreme compact starbursts. We explore the potential evolutionary link between CONs and CT AGN by searching for CONs in hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). Here, we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations that targeted HCN-vib emission in four hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN. We analyze these objects together with literature HCN-vib measurements of five additional hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the GOALS sample. We do not detect any CONs in this combined sample of nine CT AGN. We then explore a proposed evolutionary sequence in which CONs evolve into X-ray-detectable CT AGN once outflows and feedback reduce the column densities of the enshrouding gas. We find, however, no evidence of well-developed dense molecular outflows in the observed CT AGN. While this could suggest that CT AGN are not universally linked to CONs, it could also be explained by a short duty cycle for molecular outflows.

  We report on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of infrared-bright dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) with $(i - [22])_{\rm AB} \geq 7.0$. Using photometry from the deep and wide Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey, combined with near-IR and mid-IR data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we successfully identified 382 DOGs in $\sim$ 170 deg$^2$. Among them, the vast majority (376 DOGs) were classified into two subclasses: bump DOGs (132/376) and power-law (PL) DOGs (244/376), which are dominated by star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN), respectively. Through the SED analysis, we found that roughly half (120/244) of the PL DOGs show ``broken'' power-law SEDs. The significant red slope from optical to near-IR in the SEDs of these ``broken power-law DOGs'' (BPL DOGs) probably reflects their large amount of dust extinction. In other words, BPL DOGs are more heavily obscured AGNs, compared to PL DOGs with non-broken power-law SEDs.

  We have discovered a substantial sodium doublet (Na D $\lambda\lambda$5890, 5896\AA)-traced neutral outflow in a quenching galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at $z=1.317$ in GOODS-S field. Its JWST NIRSpec/MSA spectrum shows a significantly blueshifted and deep Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with a velocity of $v_{\rm out}=828^{+79}_{-49}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a mass outflow rate of $\log(\dot{M}_{\rm out}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}})=2.40^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$. The mass outflow rate of this outflow is higher than any of the neutral outflows identified previously beyond $z\sim1$ by the same line diagnostic and is comparable with those in local galaxies with extremely strong star formation activities or luminous AGN. Nonetheless, the best-fit SED modeling of JADES-GS-206183, based on its multi-band photometry from HST/ACS to JWST/NIRCam, suggests that the host galaxy now is quenched, and the Paschen $\alpha$ (Pa$\alpha$) emission in the FRESCO NIRCam grism spectrum confirms its current low star formation rate ($10.78\pm 0.55\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$). More surprisingly, optical line ratio diagnostics indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the H$\alpha$ line, it is more likely tracing the ionized outflow than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, we propose that the outflow that we are witnessing in JADES-GS-206183 may be a long-lasting fossil outflow, powered by previous AGN activity that has recently shut down.

  We present a catalog of Local Universe Near-Infrared Seyfert (LUNIS) \textit{K-}band integral field unit (IFU) data of 88 nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), curated from SINFONI/VLT and OSIRIS/Keck archival datasets. This catalog includes both type 1 and 2 Seyfert AGN probed down to scales of tens of parsecs with z $&lt;$ 0.02 and spanning over five orders of magnitude in L$_{14-195keV}$ AGN luminosity. As part of this catalog we make publicly available for all galaxies the processed datacubes, a central 200 pc integrated spectrum, and two-dimensional maps of flux, velocity, and velocity dispersion for H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) 2.1218 $\mu$m, [Si VI] 1.9641 $\mu$m, and Br-$\gamma$ 2.1655 $\mu$m. The morphology and geometry of [Si VI], a tracer of AGN outflows, are reported for the 66$\%$ of galaxies with extended emission. We utilize this large sample to probe the behavior of molecular and ionized gas, identifying trends in the properties of the circumnuclear gas (surface brightness and velocity dispersion) with fundamental AGN properties (obscuration and X-ray luminosity). While there is significant variation in circumnuclear gas characteristics across the sample, we find molecular hydrogen to be less centrally concentrated and exhibit lower velocity dispersion relative to ionized gas. In addition, we find elevated molecular hydrogen surface brightness and decreased [Si VI] velocity dispersion in obscured relative to unobscured AGN. The [Si VI] and Br-$\gamma$ emission scale with L$_{14-195keV}$ X-ray luminosity, which, along with the elevated velocity dispersion compared to the molecular gas, verifies an association with AGN outflow processes.

  We investigate the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary signatures and the feasibility of identifying them through X-ray reflection spectra. The X-ray emitting region is modeled as a set of two mini-disks bound to the individual SMBHs separated by 100 $GM/c^2$ and the spectra calculated as a function of the mass, mass ratio, and total accretion rate of the binary. The X-ray reflection features are strongly influenced by the accretion-inversion phenomenon expected in SMBH binaries, which results in a wide range of ionization conditions in the two mini-disks. These are imprinted in the resulting composite spectra and the double-peaked and time-variable relativistic Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles. To test whether these features can be used as evidence for the presence of an SMBH binary, we fit mock 100\,ks observations with a single AGN model. For a $10^9$ $M_\odot$ binary targeted by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), at $z=0.1$ the single AGN model clearly fails to fit the data, while at $z=1$ the fit is acceptable but unable to converge on the SMBH spin. For a $10^6$ $M_\odot$ binary, a progenitor of a \textit{Laser Interferometer Space Antenna} (\textit{LISA}) source, spectral fitting is only possible at $z=0.1$, with the outcomes similar to the PTA binary at $z=1$. We also find that PTA binaries can be expected to show a distinct X-ray spectral variability in multi-epoch observations, whereas for \textit{LISA} precursors, orbital averaging results in the loss of spectral variability signatures.

  The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), with its extensive optical monitoring capabilities, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this work, we present a comparative analysis of optical colour and brightness variability for $\mathrm{log(L_{Bol})}-z$ matched samples, consisting of 2095 Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies similar to Broad-line Seyfert 1s (NLSy1_A) and 538 NLSy1_B galaxies matched with quasars (QSOs). The corresponding respective control samples of consist of 2380 Broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies and 741 QSOs. Using over six years of r-band and g-band light curves from the ZTF Data Release 22 (DR22), we characterize flux variability, fractional flux variability, and amplitude of temporal variability for each source in the samples. Our results indicate that BLSy1 galaxies exhibit significantly stronger variability compared to NLSy1_As, and similarly, QSOs show more variability than do NLSy1_Bs. To probe colour variability, we utilize quasi-simultaneous light curves, with half-hour epoch differences between $g$- and $r$-band measurements where colour index was evaluated using linear regression in magnitude-magnitude space. We find that large majorities of these sources -- 96% of NLSy1_A, 95% of BLSy1, 94% of NLSy1_B, and 91% of QSOs -- exhibit a clear "bluer-when-brighter" (BWB) trend. Furthermore, rest-frame structure function analysis reveals that BLSy1 galaxies are $1.42\pm0.06$ times more variable than NLSy1_A, while QSOs are $1.41\pm0.01$ times more variable than NLSy1_B. These results can provide valuable insights into the variability properties of AGN subclasses and their underlying physical drivers.

  The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.
