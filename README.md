  Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered numerous faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z\sim5$ and beyond. These objects are key to our understanding of the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), their co-evolution with host galaxies, as well as the role of AGN in cosmic reionization. Using photometric colors and size measurements, we perform a search for compact red objects in an array of blank deep JWST/NIRCam fields totaling $\sim340$ arcmin$^{2}$. Our careful selection yields 260 reddened AGN candidates at $4&lt;z_{\rm phot}&lt;9$, dominated by a point-source like central component ($\langle r_{\rm eff} \rangle =91^{+39}_{-23}$ pc) and displaying a dichotomy in their rest-frame colors (blue UV and red optical slopes). Quasar model fitting reveals our objects to be moderately dust extincted ($A_{\rm V}\sim1.6$), which is reflected in their inferred bolometric luminosities of $L_{\rm bol}$ = 10$^{44-47}$ erg/s, and fainter UV magnitudes $M_{\rm UV} \simeq$ $-17$ to $-22$. Thanks to the large areas explored, we extend the existing dusty AGN luminosity functions to both fainter and brighter magnitudes, confirming their number densities to be $\times100$ higher than for UV-selected quasars of similar magnitudes. At the same time they constitute only a small fraction of all UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts, but this percentage rises to $\sim$10 % for $M_{UV}\sim -22$ at $z\sim7$. Finally, assuming a conservative case of accretion at the Eddington rate, we place a lower limit on the SMBH mass function at $z\sim5$, finding it to be consistent with both theory and previous observations.

  Supermassive black holes require a reservoir of cold gas at the centre of their host galaxy in order to accrete and shine as active galactic nuclei (AGN). Major mergers have the ability to drive gas rapidly inwards, but observations trying to link mergers with AGN have found mixed results due to the difficulty of consistently identifying galaxy mergers in surveys. This study applies deep learning to this problem, using convolutional neural networks trained to identify simulated post-merger galaxies from survey-realistic imaging. This provides a fast and repeatable alternative to human visual inspection. Using this tool, we examine a sample of ~8500 Seyfert 2 galaxies (L[OIII] ~ $10^{38.5 - 42}$ erg/s) at z &lt; 0.3 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and find a merger fraction of $2.19_{-0.17}^{+0.21}$% compared with inactive control galaxies, in which we find a merger fraction of $2.96_{-0.20}^{+0.26}$%, indicating an overall lack of mergers among AGN hosts compared with controls. However, matching the controls to the AGN hosts in stellar mass and star formation rate reveals that AGN hosts in the star-forming blue cloud exhibit a ~$2\times$ merger enhancement over controls, while those in the quiescent red sequence have significantly lower relative merger fractions, leading to the observed overall deficit due to the differing $M_{\ast} - $SFR distributions. We conclude that while mergers are not the dominant trigger of all low-luminosity, obscured AGN activity in the nearby Universe, they are more important to AGN fuelling in galaxies with higher cold gas mass fractions as traced through star formation.

  Post-starburst galaxies are believed to be in a rapid transition between major merger starbursts and quiescent ellipticals, where AGN feedback is suggested as one of the processes responsible for the quenching. To study the role of AGN feedback, we constructed a sample of post-starburst candidates with AGN and indications of ionized outflows. We use MUSE/VLT observations to resolve the properties of the stars and multi-phased gas in five of them. All the galaxies show signatures of interaction/merger in their stellar or gas properties, with some galaxies at an early stage of interaction with companions at distances $\sim$50 kpc, suggesting that optical post-starburst signatures may be present well before the final starburst and coalescence. We detect narrow and broad kinematic components in multiple transitions in all the galaxies. Our detailed analysis of their kinematics and morphology suggests that, contrary to our expectation, the properties of the broad kinematic components are inconsistent with AGN-driven winds in 3 out of 5 galaxies. The two exceptions are also the only galaxies in which spatially-resolved NaID P-Cygni profiles are detected. In some cases, the observations are more consistent with interaction-induced galactic-scale flows, an often overlooked process. These observations raise the question of how to interpret broad kinematic components in interacting and perhaps also in active galaxies, in particular when spatially-resolved observations are not available or cannot rule out merger-induced galactic-scale motions. We suggest that NaID P-Cygni profiles are more effective outflow tracers, and use them to estimate the energy that is carried by the outflow.
