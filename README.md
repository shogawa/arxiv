  Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for significant dust extinction of $A_V \gtrsim 3$ mag. However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared emission and a potential "dust budget crisis" in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI, Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly constrained to $A_V \lesssim 1.0$ mag for A2744-45924 and $A_V \lesssim 1.5$ mag for RUBIES-BLAGN-1 under the SMC extinction laws, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised $A_V$ values yield a radiative efficiencies of $10\%$ for the LRD population, easing the tension with the Soltan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories, provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.

  Bright SMGs contribute significantly to the star formation rate (SFR) density (20-50\%) and stellar mass density ($\sim$ 30-50\%) at $z=$ 2-4 with SFRs$\ge 1000$ M$_\odot$,yr$^{-1}$ and stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}$-$10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. The number of bright SMGs with such high SFRs is hard to reconcile with the standard models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper we provide evidence that, in a small sample of 12 bright SMGs, the SFRs derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting are significantly higher than those obtained using low-frequency radio emission as a proxy for star formation. Using the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT), which allows imaging at 144 MHz with sub-arcsecond angular resolution, we have produced deep images of a small sample of bright SMGs in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field extracted from the NEPSC2 survey. For all 12 SMGs, we find radio-emitting mid-infrared galaxies at distances from a few arcseconds down to sub-arcsecond scales from the SMG and/or the presence of a radio-emitting AGN. The SFRs derived from the radio emission of the SMG, disentangled from the AGN-related radio emission, are systematically lower by a factor of $\sim 5$ (median value) than those derived from the multi-band SED fitting. We discuss whether our assumptions might be, at least in part, responsible for the observed discrepancy. We argue that the radio-derived SFRs are not systematically underestimated but can be affected by a significant dispersion ($0.3-0.5$ dex). Considering these new SFR estimates, the offset of the specific SFR of the 12 bright SMGs from the star-forming galaxy main sequence ($\Delta\mathrm{(SSFR)}$) is significantly reduced, with all 12 bright SMGs which are only a factor of 2 more star-forming than the main sequence galaxies.

  In part I of this series we discussed the variation of star-formation histories (SFHs) across the specific star formation rate - stellar mass plane (sSFR-M$_{\star}$) using the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). Here we explore the physical mechanisms that are likely driving these observational trends, by comparing the properties of galaxies with common recent SFH shapes. Overall, we find that the processes shaping the movement of galaxies through the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane can be be largely split into two stellar mass regimes, bounded by the minimum SFR dispersion ($\sigma_{SFR}$) point. At lower stellar masses we find that large $\sigma_{SFR}$ values are likely observed due to a combination of stochastic star-formation processes and a large variety in absolute sSFR values, but relatively constant/flat SFHs. While at higher stellar masses we see strong observational evidence that Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are associated with rapidly declining SFHs, and that these galaxies reside in the high $\sigma_{SFR}$ region of the plane. As such, we suggest that AGN feedback, leading to galaxy quenching, is the primary driver of the high $\sigma_{SFR}$ values. These results are consistent with previous theoretical interpretations of the $\sigma_{SFR}$-M$_{\star}$ relation.

  This study investigates the projected, quasi-symmetric $\sim\rm46\,kpc$-scale diffuse radio lobes surrounding the giant elliptical galaxy M\,87, utilizing well-sampled wideband ($\rm 60\,MHz-10.55\,GHz$) observations from MWA and VLA, supplemented by data from LOFAR and Effelsberg. The observed structures feature sharp edges and filaments, with nearly uniform and moderately steep spectral indices ($\alpha$, mostly within $-1.2\leq\alpha\leq-0.8$), indicating turbulence. Well-sampled radio spectra for the lobes' diffuse region are derived using the continuous injection (CI) model (with $\alpha_{\rm inj}\simeq-0.86$ and $\nu_{\rm b}\simeq1.72\rm\,GHz$), and for its three localized regions using the impulsive injection model (e.g., JP model). From energy equipartition analysis, we estimate the typical magnetic field strength in the lobes' diffuse region to be $B_{\rm eq}\simeq10\,\mu\rm G$. The age of the lobes is estimated as $\sim30-50\,\rm~Myr$, based on lifetimes derived from the CI and JP models and sound crossing time. Outflow powers of $\sim(0.2-2)\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for the lobes' diffuse components and $\sim(1-11)\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for the whole source are calculated. With this power assessment, we conclude that the galactic stellar wind has a negligible effect, the active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven jet can provide the necessary energy for the whole system. Furthermore, we argue that while the wind driven by current AGN activity is unlikely to power the lobes' diffuse components, an average enhancement of AGN activity by a factor of $\sim 10^2$ over the past $\sim 30-50$ Myr remains plausible.

  Absorption outflows in quasars play an important role in understanding active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and their influence on galaxy evolution. The unprecedented spectral data provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) opens new avenues to explore these outflows. We analyze five low-ionization absorption outflow systems in four intermediate-redshift quasars (2 &lt; z &lt; 3) using the data obtained by DESI in order to characterize their physical properties and energetics, and also to assess their role in AGN feedback. We use the spectra from DESI's Early Data Release to determine the ionic column densities, total hydrogen column densities, electron number densities, and ionization parameters via photoionization modeling and absorption line analysis. We derive the outflows' distance from the AGN, and its kinematic properties: mass-flow rates, kinetic luminosity, and momentum flux. Our study identifies five distinct mini-broad absorption line outflow systems, hosted by four quasars. The identified outflows exhibit hydrogen column densities of \log (N_H) = 20.0-20.7[cm^{-2}], ionization parameters of log (U_H) = -2.7 to -2.1, and electron number densities of log (n_e) =1.45-2.85[cm^{-2}]. The distances of the outflows from the central source are between 4.5 to 31 kpc, and the kinetic luminosities range from 2\times10^{-6} to 5\times10^{-3} of the Eddington luminosity. The outflows in J1407 and J1032 show the largest kinetic luminosities, with momentum flux ratios (\dot{p} / \dot{p}_{rad}) of about 2 and 0.2, respectively. Our findings highlight the vital role of DESI data in uncovering the diversity and significance of quasar outflows in galaxy evolution.

  In the course of studying the 3C 220.3 lensing system, spectra were obtained with the Binospec instrument on the MMT for 511 additional objects in 3C 220.3's vicinity. These gave 146 good-quality galaxy redshifts and identified 126 Galactic stars. The galaxy redshift histogram shows a peak near 3C 220.3's redshift, but there is no evidence for or against a galaxy group within 2 Mpc of 3C 220.3 itself. The spectra revealed 12 AGN candidates including a likely $z\approx4.64$ broad-line QSO. Visible and near-infrared imaging with HST allowed morphological classifications of 14 galaxies. One system is a potential analog of the Milky Way-LMC system with stellar mass ratio $\sim$0.6.
