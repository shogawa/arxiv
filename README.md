  Predictions from current theories and simulations suggest that dual AGN systems are exceedingly rare at high redshifts. The intense radiation and powerful outflows from AGNs regulate star formation, heat the interstellar medium, and drive massive gas outflows that shape the host galaxy and its surroundings. One manifestation of AGN feedback is the creation of extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. However, identifying these systems at high-$z$ is challenging. Here, we report a remarkable dual AGN candidate at $z \sim 5.4$ using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec, with a separation of $\sim1.7$ arcseconds ($\sim10.4$ pkpc). This is one of the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift dual AGNs discovered. Photometric SED fitting shows excellent agreement with AGN templates, strongly suggesting a rare dual AGN system. BPT diagrams and high ionisation lines further support the presence of AGNs. VLT/MUSE observations reveal strong extended Ly$\alpha$ emission, extending to $&gt;22$ kpc, making it one of the most extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z \sim 6$. This provides observational evidence of anisotropic AGN-driven photoionization or shocks. The high Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction also indicates an AGN outflow. This dual AGN candidate is also associated with a well-defined overdensity, potentially at the center of a $z \sim 5.4$ protocluster or filamentary structure node. Further analysis indicates the fraction of dual AGNs is significantly higher than theoretically expected at high redshifts. This discovery provides a new opportunity to study dual AGN interactions and their impact on the circumgalactic medium and cosmic structure evolution.

  We present the discovery of two extended, low surface brightness radio continuum sources, each consisting of a near-circular body and an extended tail of emission, nicknamed Stingray 1 (ASKAP J0129-5350) and Stingray 2 (ASKAP J0245-5642). Both are found in the direction of the Magellanic Stream (MS) and were discovered in the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey at 944 MHz. We combine the ASKAP data with low-frequency radio observations from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey (GLEAM) to conduct a radio continuum analysis. We explore both Galactic/near Galactic scenarios, including runaway or circumgalactic supernova remnants (SNRs) and parentless pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe), and extragalactic scenarios including radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dying radio galaxies, galaxy clusters, galaxy pairs or groups, head-tail radio galaxies, and Odd Radio Circles (ORCs), as well as the possibility that the morphology is due to a chance alignment. The Stingrays exhibit non-thermal emission with spectral indices of $\alpha$ = -0.89 $\pm$ 0.09 for Stingray 1 and $\alpha$ = -1.77 $\pm$ 0.06 for Stingray 2. We find that none of the proposed scenarios can explain all of the observed properties, however we determine it most likely that their shape is caused by some kind of complex environmental interaction. The most likely scenario from the available data is that of a head-tail radio galaxy, but more data is required for a definitive classification.

  We present the results of a polarization study based upon relativistic magnetohydrodynamic modelling of jets running into hydrostatic, spherically symmetric cluster atmospheres. For the first time in a numerical simulation, we derive Faraday rotation measure maps (RM maps) from model cluster atmospheres based upon the universal pressure profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature profile for a 'typical' self-similar atmosphere described by only one parameter: M500. We compare our simulated polarization products with current observational data from Very Large Array (VLA) and LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR), as well as continuing investigations from our previous work, such as the detectability of the Laing Garrington effect. We also studied the variation of mean fractional polarization with cluster mass and jet power. We produce simulated Stokes Q and U channel images and using the Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis technique we create RM maps. These data provide insight into what we should expect of current and future high-resolution polarimetric studies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows as we were able to probe the limitations of the RM synthesis technique by comparing it with the RM map direct from our simulations. Highlights of our study include clear reproduction of polarization enhancements towards the edges of radio lobes for suitable conditions and a demonstration that complex lobe morphologies with multiple emission and Faraday active regions interspersed as might be expected in some pole-on or perhaps precessing sources should be distinguishable in observations with current technology. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster atmosphere, these numerical simulations, and the polarimetric properties derived from them, represent the most realistic yet for spherically symmetric atmospheres.
