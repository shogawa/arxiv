  Deep radio surveys of extragalactic legacy fields trace a large range of spatial and brightness temperature sensitivity scales, and therefore have differing biases to radio-emitting physical components within galaxies. This is particularly true of radio surveys performed at less than 1 arcsec angular resolutions, and so robust comparisons are necessary to better understand the biases present in each survey. We present a multi-resolution and multi-wavelength analysis of the sources detected in a new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of the CANDELS GOODS-North field. For the 24 VLBA-selected sources described in Paper I, we augment the VLBA data with EVN data, ~0.1-1 arcsecond angular resolution data provided by VLA and e-MERLIN. This sample includes new AGN detected in this field, thanks to a new source extraction technique that adopts priors from ancillary multi-wavelength data. The high brightness temperatures of these sources (Tb &gt; 10^6 K) confirm AGN cores, that would often be missed or ambiguous in lower-resolution radio data of the same sources. Furthermore, only 15 sources are identified as 'radiative' AGN based on available X-ray and infrared constraints. By combining VLA and VLBA measurements, we find evidence that the majority of the extended radio emission is also AGN dominated, with only 3 sources with evidence for extended potentially star-formation dominated radio emission. We demonstrate the importance of wide-field multi-resolution (arcsecond-milliarcsecond) coverage of the faint radio source population, for a complete picture of the multi-scale processes within these galaxies.

  Aims. Recent observational studies suggest that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may play an important role in the formation and evolution of low-mass dwarf galaxies, an issue that has received little attention from a theoretical perspective. Methods. We investigate this using two sets of 12 cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of dwarf galaxies: one set using a version of the AURIGA galaxy formation physics model including AGN feedback and a parallel set with AGN feedback turned off. Results. We show that the full-physics AGN runs satisfactorily reproduce several scaling relations, including the M_ BH-M_*, M_ BH-sigma_* and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. We find that the global star formation (SF) of galaxies run with AGN is reduced compared to the one in which AGN has been turned off, suggesting that this type of feedback is a viable way of suppressing SF in low-mass dwarfs, even though none of our galaxies is completely quenched by z=0. Furthermore, we found a tight correlation between the median SF rates and the black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio (M_BH/M_star) in our simulated dwarfs. SF is suppressed due to gas heating in the vicinity of the AGN: less HI gas is available in AGN runs, though the total amount of gas is preserved across the two settings within each galaxy. This indicates that the main effect of AGN feedback in our dwarfs is to heat up and push the gas away from the galaxy's centre rather than expelling it completely. Finally, we show that the two galaxies harbouring the largest BHs have suffered a considerable (up to 65%) reduction in their central dark matter density, pinpointing the role of AGNs in determining the final dark matter mass distribution within dwarf galaxies. This pilot paper highlights the importance of modelling AGN feedback at the lowest mass scales and the impact this can have on dwarf galaxy evolution.

  The finding of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies has important implications for galaxy evolution and supermassive black hole formation models. Yet, how AGN in dwarf galaxies form is still debated, in part due to scant demographics. We make use of the MaNGA survey, comprising $\sim$10,000 galaxies at z $&lt;$ 0.15, to identify AGN dwarf galaxies using a spaxel by spaxel classification in three spatially-resolved emission line diagnostic diagrams (the [NII-, [SII]- and [OI]-BPT) and the WHAN diagram. This yields a sample of 664 AGN dwarf galaxies, the largest to date, and an AGN fraction of $\sim20\%$ that is significantly larger than that of single-fiber-spectroscopy studies (i.e. $\sim1\%$). This can be explained by the lower bolometric luminosity ($&lt; 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and accretion rate (sub-Eddington) of the MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies. We additionally identify 1,176 SF-AGN (classified as star-forming in the [NII]-BPT but as AGN in the [SII]- and [OI]-BPT), 122 Composite, and 173 LINER sources. The offset between the optical center of the galaxy and the median position of the AGN spaxels is more than 3 arcsec for $\sim$62\% of the AGN, suggesting that some could be off-nuclear. We also identify seven new broad-line AGN with log $M_\mathrm{BH}$ = 5.0 - 5.9 $M_\mathrm{\odot}$. Our results show how integral-field spectroscopy is a powerful tool for uncovering faint and low-accretion AGN and better constraining the demographics of AGN in dwarf galaxies.
