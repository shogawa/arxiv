  We report the discovery of the hyperluminous, highly obscured AGN WISE J190445.04+485308.9 (W1904+4853 hereafter, $L_{bol} = 1.1 \times 10^{13} \ L_{\odot}$) at z=0.415. Its well-sampled spectral energy distribution (SED) is dominated by infrared dust emission, though broad emission lines are detected in the optical spectra. These features suggest that W1904+4853 contains an actively accreting supermassive black hole hidden in its dusty cocoon, resembling the observed properties of Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs), a population previously only identified at z&gt;1.0. Using the broad component of the MgII emission line, we estimate a black hole mass of $log \ (M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 8.4 \pm 0.3$. The corresponding Eddington ratio of $1.4 \pm 0.2$ implies that the central black hole accretion is at the theoretical limit of isotropic accretion. The rest-frame UV-optical SED and [O II] emission line also indicate that the host galaxy of W1904+4853 harbors strong star formation activity at the rate of up to $\sim 45 \ M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}$. With an estimated stellar mass of $3 \times 10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$, the host galaxy appears to be a starburst system with respect to the main sequence of the star-forming galaxies at the same redshift. Although blueshifted and asymmetric [O III] emission provides evidence of an outflow, we estimate it to be an order of magnitude smaller than the star formation rate, indicating that the current obscured AGN activity at the center has not yet produced significant feedback on the host galaxy star formation activity. W1904+4853 supports the interpretation that Hot DOGs are a rare transitional phase of AGN accretion in galaxy evolution, a phase that can persist into the present-day Universe.

  The non linear correlation between the UV and X-ray emission observed in Active Galactic Nuclei remains a puzzling question that challenged accretion models. While the UV emission originates from the cold disk, the X-ray emission is emitted by a hot corona whose physical characteristics and geometry are still highly debated. The Jet Emitting Disk - Standard Accretion Disk (JED-SAD) is a spectral model stemming from self similar accretion-ejection solutions. It is composed of an inner highly magnetized and hot accretion flow launching jets, the JED, and an outer SAD. The model has been successfully applied to X-ray binaries outbursts. The AGN UV X-ray correlation represent another essential test for the JED-SAD model. We use multiple AGN samples to explore the parameter space and identify the regions able to reproduce the observations. In this first paper, we show that JED-SAD model is able to reproduce the UV--X-ray correlation.

  The 500ks Chandra ACIS-I observation of the field around the $z=6.31$ quasar SDSS J1030+0524 is currently the 5th deepest extragalactic X-ray survey. The rich multi-band coverage of the field allowed for an effective identification and redshift determination of the X-ray source counterparts: to date a catalog of 243 extragalactic X-ray sources with either a spectroscopic or photometric redshift estimate in the range $z\approx0-6$ is available over a 355 arcmin$^2$ area. Given its depth and the multi-band information, this catalog is an excellent resource to investigate X-ray spectral properties of distant Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and derive the redshift evolution of their obscuration. We performed a thorough X-ray spectral analysis for each object in the sample, measuring its nuclear column density $N_{\rm H}$ and intrinsic (de-absorbed) 2-10 keV rest-frame luminosity, $L_{2-10}$. Whenever possible, we also used the presence of the Fe K$_\alpha$ emission line to improve the photometric redshift estimates. We measured the fractions of AGN hidden by column densities in excess of $10^{22}$ and $10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$ ($f_{22}$ and $f_{23}$, respectively) as a function of $L_{2-10}$ and redshift, and corrected for selection effects to recover the intrinsic obscured fractions. At $z\sim 1.2$, we found $f_{22}\sim0.7-0.8$ and $f_{23}\sim0.5-0.6$, respectively, in broad agreement with the results from other X-ray surveys. No significant variations with X-ray luminosity were found within the limited luminosity range probed by our sample (log$L_{2-10}\sim 42.8-44.3$). When focusing on luminous AGN with log$L_{2-10}\sim44$ to maximize the sample completeness up to large cosmological distances, we did not observe any significant change in $f_{22}$ or $f_{23}$ over the redshift range $z\sim0.8-3$. Nonetheless, the obscured fractions we measure are significantly higher than ...

  We present new Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) 3.6 and 4.5{\mu}m mosaics of three fields, E-COSMOS, DEEP2-F3, and ELAIS-N1. Our mosaics include both new IRAC observations as well as re-processed archival data in these fields. These fields are part of the HSC-Deep grizy survey and have a wealth of additional ancillary data. The addition of these new IRAC mosaics is critical in allowing for improved photometric redshifts and stellar population parameters at cosmic noon and earlier epochs. The total area mapped by this work is {\sim} 17 deg2 with a mean integration time of {\sim}1200s, providing a median 5{\sigma} depth of 23.7(23.3) at 3.6(4.5){\mu}m in AB. We perform SExtractor photometry both on the combined mosaics as well as the single-epoch mosaics taken {\sim}6 months apart. The resultant IRAC number counts show good agreement with previous studies. In combination with the wealth of existing and upcoming spectro-photometric data in these fields, our IRAC mosaics will enable a wide range of galactic evolution and AGN studies. With that goal in mind, we make the combined IRAC mosaics and coverage maps of these three fields publicly available. counts show good agreement with previous studies.
