  We carried out a uniform and systematic analysis of a sample of 112 nearby bright Seyfert 1 type AGN, the observations of which were carried out by the {\it Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR)} between August 2013 and May 2022. The main goal of this analysis is to investigate the nature of the X-ray corona in Seyfert 1 galaxies. From the physical model that fits the {\it NuSTAR} spectra, we could constrain the high energy cut-off ($\rm{E_{cut}}$) for 73 sources in our sample. For those 73 sources, we fitted the Comptonization model to estimate the temperature ($\rm{kT_{e}}$) of their corona. $\rm{kT_{e}}$ could be constrained in 42 sources. We investigated for possible correlations between various properties of the corona obtained from physical model fits to the observed spectra and between various coronal parameters and physical properties of the sources such as Eddington ratio and black hole mass. We found (a) a strong correlation between $\rm{E_{cut}}$ and the photon index and (b) a significant negative correlation between $\rm{kT_{e}}$ and the optical depth.

  The luminous narrow line Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143 was the first non-BAL AGN to reveal a powerful ionized wind, based on early observations with ESA's XMM X-ray Observatory. Subsequent observations, mainly with XMM and the Japanese SUZAKU Observatory, found such winds to be a common feature of luminous AGN. Typical outflow velocities of v $\sim 0.1$c and flow momenta $m v \sim L_{\rm Edd} /c$ are consistent with winds being launched by continuum driving from a disc when the local mass accretion rate is super-Eddington. Here we report the launch of a new, ultra-fast outflow component in PG1211+143, near the end of a 5-week XMM observing campaign, and discuss its origin in an ultra-fast {\it inflow} of similar velocity detected some 3 weeks earlier. We find that the inflow lasted for at least 3 days and delivered some 10 Earth mass of fresh material into the innermost region of the source. While this mass by itself is insufficient to cause a complete inner disc restructuring, we show that it is sufficient to disrupt the X-ray emitting corona of the disc. We conclude that it is this coronal re-arrangement of the inner tens gravitational radii in PG1211+143 that subsequently caused the launch of a new wind.

  We use deep JWST/NIRSpec R~1000 slit spectra of 113 galaxies at 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, selected from the mass-complete Blue Jay survey, to investigate the prevalence and typical properties of neutral gas outflows at cosmic noon. We detect excess Na I D absorption (beyond the stellar contribution) in 46% of massive galaxies ($\log$ M$_*$/M$_\odot &gt;$ 10), with similar incidence rates in star-forming and quenching systems. Half of the absorption profiles are blueshifted by at least 100 km/s, providing unambiguous evidence for neutral gas outflows. Galaxies with strong Na I D absorption are distinguished by enhanced emission line ratios consistent with AGN ionization. We conservatively measure mass outflow rates of 3 - 100 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$; comparable to or exceeding ionized gas outflow rates measured for galaxies at similar stellar mass and redshift. The outflows from the quenching systems (log(sSFR)[yr$^{-1}$] $\lesssim$ -10) have mass loading factors of 4 - 360, and the energy and momentum outflow rates exceed the expected injection rates from supernova explosions, suggesting that these galaxies could possibly be caught in a rapid blowout phase powered by the AGN. Our findings suggest that AGN-driven ejection of cold gas may be a dominant mechanism for fast quenching of star formation at z~2.

  The inter-band correlations between optical/UV and X-ray luminosities of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are important for understanding the disc-coronal connection, as well as using AGN as standard candles for cosmology. It is conventional to measure the X-ray luminosity at rest frame 2 keV and compare to the UV luminosity at the rest-frame 2500 \AA, but the wavelength-dependence was never well explored. In this work, we adopt a well-defined sample of 1169 unobscured quasars in the redshift range 0.13 - 4.51, and apply the direct-correlation method to explore how the correlation with the 2 keV luminosity changes at different optical/UV wavelengths, from 1280 - 5550 \AA\ where the spectral quality is high. We find that the luminosity at all UV continuum wavelengths correlates with the X-ray luminosity similarly to that at 2500 \AA, and that these correlations are better than at the optical wavelengths. Strong self-correlation is also found in the broadband optical/UV continuum, supporting the scenario that it is dominated by the disc emission. Correlations of various emission lines are also investigated (e.g. C IV, C III], Mg II, H$\beta$, [O III]$\lambda\lambda 4959/5007$), including the Baldwin effect and correlations involving line-widths. We find the forms of these line correlations are different, and they are also different from their underlying continua, suggesting various complexities in the line-generation process. We discuss these results in the disc-wind scenario. Our study confirms that the rest-frame 2500 \AA\ is a good wavelength to represent the optical/UV continual properties of quasars, and shows the advantages of the direct-correlation method.

  Without additional heating, radiative cooling of the halo gas of massive galaxies (Milky Way mass and above) produces cold gas or stars exceeding that observed. Heating from AGN jets is likely required, but the jet properties remain unclear. Our previous work (Su et al. 2021) concludes from simulations of a halo with $10^{14} M_\odot$ that a successful jet model should have an energy flux comparable to the free-fall energy flux at the cooling radius and should inflate a sufficiently wide cocoon with a long enough cooling time. In this paper, we investigate three jet modes with constant fluxes satisfying the criteria, including thermal jets, CR jets, and precessing kinetic jets in $10^{12}-10^{15}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ halos using high-resolution, non-cosmological MHD simulations with the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model, conduction, and viscosity. We find that scaling the jet energy according to the free-fall energy at the cooling radius can successfully suppress the cooling flows and quench galaxies without obviously violating observational constraints. We investigate an alternative scaling method in which we adjust the energy flux based on the total cooling rate within the cooling radius. However, we observe that the strong ISM cooling dominates the total cooling rate in this scaling approach, resulting in a jet flux that exceeds the amount needed to suppress the cooling flows. With the same energy flux, the cosmic ray-dominant jet is most effective in suppressing the cooling flow across all the surveyed halo masses due to the enhanced CR pressure support. We confirm that the criteria for a successful jet model, which we proposed in Su et al. (2021), work across a much wider range, encompassing halo masses of $10^{12}-10^{15} {\rm M_\odot}$.
