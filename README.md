  We report a characterization of an X-ray-detected quiescent galaxy at $z=2.09$, named COS-XQG1, using JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. This galaxy is detected in Chandra imaging, suggesting the presence of an AGN with a high black hole accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm BH}=0.22\pm0.03\, {\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. Using multi-wavelength photometry from X-ray to sub-millimeter, including the latest JWST imaging, we confirm that COS-XQG1 is massive ($M_\star = (1.6\pm0.2)\times10^{11}\, M_\odot$) and quiescent (${\rm sSFR}=(0.9\pm 1.8)\times10^{-11}\, {\rm yr^{-1}}$) as reported previously, even considering the contribution from AGN emission. Noticeably, COS-XQG1 displays a broad line H$\alpha$ emission component with a full width at half maximum of $4491^{+118}_{-110}\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ in its NIRSpec spectrum. The line width and luminosity of the broad H$\alpha$ emission give a black hole mass of $\log{(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)} = 8.45\pm0.02\, (\pm 0.5)$. With a stellar velocity dispersion measurement ($\sigma_\star=235\pm35\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$), we find that this galaxy is consistent with the local relations in the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ and $M_{\rm BH}- M_\star$ planes, which might suggest that massive quiescent galaxies at $z\geq2$ have already been mature in terms of both stellar and black hole masses and will not evolve significantly. In addition, image 2D-decomposition analysis finds that this galaxy comprises disk and point source components. The latter is likely the composition of an AGN and a stellar bulge. Based on a comparison with numerical simulations, we expect that COS-XQG1 will evolve into a typical bulge-dominated quiescent galaxy with lower AGN activity by redshift 0. This study shows the usefulness of X-ray-detected quiescent galaxies in investigating the co-evolution between SMBHs and galaxies in the early Universe.

  We performed the first simulations of accretion onto the compact objects in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) spacetime. The results obtained in general relativity are representative of those for spherically symmetric naked singularities and black holes in a number of modified gravity theories. A possible application of these calculations is to the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with their powerful jets. It is now possible to compare the results of such simulations with the accreting supermassive objects in our own Milky Way and the nearest spiral galaxy: observations of the core regions of galactic nuclei (Sgr A* and M87) performed with unprecedented resolution by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration allow fairly direct tests of the spacetime-metric of the central compact object. In this context we present general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulation results of accretion from an orbiting accretion torus (with a cusp) onto a RN black hole and a RN naked singularity. The results could not be more different for the two cases. For a black hole, just as in the familiar Kerr/Schwarzschild case, matter overflowing the cusp plunges into the black hole horizon. For the naked singularity, the accreting matter forms an inner structure of toroidal topology and leaves the system via powerful outflows. It is an open question whether this inner structure can give rise to an image quantitatively similar to the ones reported by EHT for M87 and Sgr A*.
