  The chemical enrichment in low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) is still an issue with spatial resolution spectroscopic data due to the lack of studies and the uncertainties in the nature of their ionizing source, despite being the most abundant type of active galaxies in the nearby Universe. Considering different scenarios for the ionizing source (hot old stellar populations, active galactic nuclei (AGN) or inefficient accretion disks), we analyze the implications of these assumptions to constrain the chemical content of the gas-phase interstellar medium (ISM). We used a sample of 105 galaxies from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, whose nuclear central spaxels show LINER-like emission. For each scenario considered, we built a grid of photoionization models (4928 models for each considered ionizing source) which are later used in the open-source code HII-CHI-Mistry, allowing us to estimate chemical abundance ratios such as 12+log(O/H) or log(N/O) and constrain the ionization parameter that characterize the ionized ISM in those galaxies. We obtain that oxygen abundances in the nuclear region of LINER-like galaxies spread over a wide range 8.08 &lt; 12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.89, with a median solar value (in agreement with previous studies) if AGN models are considered. Nevertheless, the derived nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio is much less affected by the assumptions on the ionizing source, and point towards suprasolar values (log(N/O) = -0.69). By comparing the different analyzed scenarios, we show that if hot old stellar populations were responsible of the ionization of the ISM a complex picture (such as outflows and/or inflows scaling with galaxy chemical abundance) would be needed to explain the chemical enrichment history, whereas the assumption of AGN activity is compatible with the standard scenario found in most galaxies.

  Hydrodynamical simulation predictions are often compared with observational data without fully accounting for systematics and biases specific to observational techniques. Using the magnetohydrodynamical simulation Magneticum, we generate mock eROSITA eRASS:4 data, combined with GAMA-like spectroscopic surveys and optically selected galaxy catalogs from the same light-cone, to analyze hot gas properties in galaxy groups via a stacking technique. This study aims to (i) incorporate observational systematics into predictions and (ii) evaluate the reliability of stacking techniques for determining average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. Our analysis provides X-ray emission predictions from Magneticum, including contributions from AGN, X-ray binaries (XRBs), and the Intra-Group Medium (IGM) as a function of halo mass, covering Milky Way (MW)-like groups to poor clusters. We find that AGN and XRBs dominate the X-ray surface brightness profiles of low-mass halos. The reliability of stacking techniques is tested by reproducing input X-ray surface brightness and electron density profiles, accounting for completeness and contamination of prior samples, miscentering of optical group centers, uncertainties in X-ray emissivity due to gas temperature and metallicity assumption, and systematics in halo mass proxies. The halo mass proxy emerges as the primary source of systematics, affecting X-ray surface brightness and scaling relations. We show that stacked X-ray luminosity-mass relations are flatter than input relations but consistent with observations. Additionally, the retrieved hot gas fraction-mass relation aligns well with observational data. These results highlight the need to account for systematic errors when comparing stacking techniques to other methods using different prior catalogs or predictions.

  Supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) launch relativistic jets that shine through the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Blazars are a subclass of AGN where non-thermal radiation from the jet is strongly beamed, as the jet is directed nearly toward the observer. Multifrequency polarimetry is emerging as a powerful probe of blazar jets, especially with the advent of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) space observatory. IXPE mostly targeted high synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazars, where both optical and X-ray emission can be attributed to synchrotron radiation from a population of non-thermal electrons. Observations of HSP blazars show that the polarization degree is strongly chromatic ($\Pi_{\rm X}/\Pi_{\rm O} \sim 2-7$), whereas the electric vector position angle (EVPA) is nearly independent of the observed frequency ($\Psi_{\rm X}\simeq\Psi_{\rm O}$). The strong chromaticity of the polarization degree was interpreted as an evidence that non-thermal electrons are accelerated by shocks. We present an alternative scenario that naturally explains IXPE observations. We study the polarization of synchrotron radiation from stationary axisymmetric jets viewed nearly on-axis. We show that the polarization degree increases significantly at high photon frequencies, as the distribution of the emitting electrons becomes softer, whereas the EVPA is nearly constant. The chromaticity of the polarization degree is much stronger in axisymmetric jets than in the case of a uniform magnetic field. Our results show that the topology of the electromagnetic fields is key to interpret multifrequency polarimetric observations of blazar jets. On the other hand, these observations may be less sensitive than previously thought to the specific particle acceleration process (e.g., shocks or magnetic reconnection).

  Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are important gravitational-wave (GW) sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). So far, their formation and evolution have been studied independently, but recent theories suggest that stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) and intermediate-mass black hole (IMBHs) can coexist in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), which indicates that EMRIs and IMRIs may form in the same place. Considering the likely encounter of the sBH and IMBH during the migration in the AGN disk, Paper I (Peng &amp; Chen 2023) shows that a gap-opening IMBH can drive a surrounding sBH to migrate synchronously. In this work, we extend the study in Paper I with more sophisticated model. We first use the 3D hydrodynamical simulation to study the co-evolution of the disk and the migration, and found that although the inner disk is partially accreted, the gaseous torque together with the tidal torque of IMBH can keep the synchronized migrate, until $\sim 10$ Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We further use a relativistic three-body simulation to study the final fate of the sBH in the GW-dominated regime, and found that in most cases the sBH can be either captured or kicked out by the IMBH, which will result in two successive IMRIs or an EMRI followed by an IMRI. Such successive EMRIs and IMRIs will bring rich information about the formation and evolution of sBHs and IMBHs in AGNs.

  We use the ROGUE I and II catalogues of radio sources associated with optical galaxies to revisit the characterization of radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in terms of radio luminosities and properties derived from the analyses of the optical spectra of their associated galaxies. We propose a physically based classification of radio galaxies into `optically inactive' and `optically active' (OPARGs and OPIRGs). In our sample, there are 14082 OPIRGs and 2721 OPARGs.After correcting for the Malmquist bias, we compared the global properties of our two classes of radio galaxies and put them in the context of the global population of galaxies. To compare the Eddington ratios of OPARGs with those of Seyferts, we devised a method to obtain the bolometric luminosities of these objects, taking into account the contribution of young stars to the observed line emission. We provide formulae to derive bolometric luminosities from the [Oiii] luminosity. We find that the distributions of radio luminosities of OPARGs and OPIRGs are undistinguishable. On average, the black hole masses and stellar masses in OPIRGs are larger than in OPARGs. OPARGs show signs of some recent star formation. Plotting the OPARGs in the BPT diagram and comparing their distribution with that of the remaining galaxies, we find that there is a sub-family of very high excitation OPARGs at the top of the AGN wing. This group is slightly displaced towards the left of the rest of the AGN galaxies, suggesting a stronger ionizing radiation field with respect to the gas pressure. Only very-high excitation radio galaxies (VHERGs) have Eddington ratios higher than 0.01, which are canonically considered as the lower limit for the occurrence of radiative efficient accretion. If our estimates of the bolometric luminosities are correct, this means than only a small proportion of mainstream HERGs are indeed radiatively efficient.

  We report the detection of H$_2$O maser emission in 4 out of 77 (5.2%) mid-IR red galaxies that meet the color criteria of $W1-W2 &gt; 0.5$ and $W1-W4 &gt; 7$ and are classified as Type-2 AGNs based on optical, near-IR, and mid-IR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. Here, $W1$, $W2$, and $W4$ represent the IR magnitudes at 3.4, 4.6, and 22 micron, respectively, as measured by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Three of the four newly identified maser galaxies are classified as either Seyfert 2 or LINER systems, but none are disk maser systems. Our analysis indicates that AGN identifications based solely on SED fitting are unreliable, resulting in an unexpectedly low detection rate. By restricting our sample to optically classified Type 2 AGNs that satisfy the mid-IR color criteria, we achieve a maser detection rate of ~13-18%, aligning with previous predictions for mid-IR red sources. These selection criteria are the most effective to date for facilitating new maser detections, particularly in light of the recent identification of additional Type 2 AGNs identified from ongoing galaxy and AGN surveys.

  We present a study of the effects of ultraviolet (UV) emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the atmospheric composition of planets and potential impact on life. It is expected that all supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, have gone through periods of high AGN activity in order to reach their current masses. We examine potential damaging effects on lifeforms on planets with different atmosphere types and receiving different levels of AGN flux, using data on the sensitivity of various species' cells to UV radiation to determine when radiation becomes ``dangerous''. We also consider potential chemical changes to planetary atmospheres as a result of UV radiation from AGN, using the PALEO photochemical model. We find the presence of sufficient initial oxygen (surface mixing ratio $\geq 10^{-3} \rm\, mol/mol$) in the planet's atmosphere allows a thicker ozone layer to form in response to AGN radiation, which reduces the level of dangerous UV radiation incident on the planetary surface from what it was in absence of an AGN. We estimate the fraction of solar systems in galaxies that would be affected by AGN UV radiation, and find that the impact is most pronounced in compact galaxies such as ``red nugget relics'', as compared to typical present-day ellipticals and spirals (using M87 and the Milky Way as examples). Our work generally supports the Gaia hypothesis, where the development of life on a planet (and resulting oxygenation of the atmosphere) causes the environment to become more stable against potential extinction events in the future.

  The coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies represents a fundamental question in astrophysics. One approach to investigating this question involves comparing the star-formation rates (SFRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with those of typical star-forming galaxies. At relatively low redshifts ($z\lesssim 1$), radio AGNs manifest diminished SFRs, indicating suppressed star formation, but their behavior at higher redshifts is unclear. To examine this, we leveraged galaxy and radio AGN data from the well-characterized W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1, and XMM-LSS fields. We established two mass-complete reference star-forming galaxy samples and two radio AGN samples, consisting of 1,763 and 6,766 radio AGNs, the former being higher in purity and the latter more complete. We subsequently computed star-forming fractions ($f_{\text{SF}}$; the fraction of star-forming galaxies to all galaxies) for galaxies and radio-AGN-host galaxies and conducted a robust comparison between them up to $z\approx3$. We found that the tendency for radio AGNs to reside in massive galaxies primarily accounts for their low $f_{\text{SF}}$, which also shows a strong negative dependence upon $M_{\star}$ and a strong positive evolution with $z$. To investigate further the star-formation characteristics of those star-forming radio AGNs, we constructed the star-forming main sequence (MS) and investigated the behavior of the position of AGNs relative to the MS at $z\approx0-3$. Our results reveal that radio AGNs display lower SFRs than star-forming galaxies in the low-$z$ and high-$M_{\star}$ regime and, conversely, exhibit comparable or higher SFRs than MS star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts or lower $M_{\star}$.

  Detecting dual active galactic nuclei (DAGN) in observations and understanding theoretically which massive black holes (MBHs) compose them and in which galactic and large-scale environment they reside are becoming increasingly important questions as we enter the multi-messenger era of MBH astronomy. This paper presents the abundance and properties of DAGN produced in nine large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We focus on DAGN powered by AGN with Lbol &gt; 1e43 erg/s and belonging to distinct galaxies, i.e. pairs that can be characterised with current and near-future electromagnetic observations. We find that the number density of DAGN separated by a few to 30 proper kpc varies from 1e-8 (or none) to 1e-3 comoving Mpc^3 in the redshift range z=0-7. At a given redshift, the densities of the DAGN numbers vary by up to two orders of magnitude from one simulation to another. However, for all simulations, the DAGN peak is in the range z=1-3, right before the peak of cosmic star formation or cosmic AGN activity. The corresponding fractions of DAGN (with respect to the total number of AGN) range from 0 to 6 percent. We find that simulations could produce too few DAGN at z=0 (or merge pairs too quickly) compared to current observational constraints while being consistent with preliminary constraints at high redshift (z = 3). Next-generation observatories (e.g., AXIS) will be of paramount importance to detect DAGN across cosmic times. We predict the detectability of DAGN with future X-ray telescopes and discuss DAGN as progenitors for future LISA gravitational wave detections.
