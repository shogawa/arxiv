  The origin of X-ray emission from the resolved kiloparsec-scale jets of many active galactic nuclei (AGN) remains uncertain, particularly where the X-ray emission is separate from the radio-optical synchrotron component. Possible explanations include inverse-Compton upscattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background (IC-CMB) and synchrotron emission from a second electron population, alternatives which imply very different physical conditions within the jet. Until now, X-ray studies of resolved jets have been restricted to the soft X-rays (below $\sim$8 keV), often showing a hard spectral index indicating a spectral peak at higher energies. Here we present \emph{NuSTAR} and \emph{Chandra} observations of the nearby powerful radio galaxy Pictor A, in which we clearly detect the western hot spot at 4' from the host galaxy, the first detection of a kpc-scale jet above 10 keV. The \emph{NuSTAR} 3$-$20 keV spectrum is best fit by a powerlaw of index $\Gamma = 2.03\pm0.04$. Using a maximum likelihood model, we confirm previous reports of variations in the soft X-ray flux detected by \emph{Chandra} over the 2000 to 2015 period, at a 6.7$\sigma$ level, higher than the 3.4$\sigma$ significance level. This rises to $&gt;8\sigma$ in the common 3-8 keV band using the full 22-year span of \emph{Chandra} and \emph{NuSTAR} observations. The variability of Pictor A rules out IC-CMB as the source of the X-ray emission, and the \emph{NuSTAR} observations are in keeping with a synchrotron origin for the X-ray emission from the western hotspot of Pictor A, with no sign of a cutoff to the flat spectrum.

  High-quality Extragalactic Legacy-field Monitoring (HELM) is a long-term observing program that photometrically monitors several well-studied extragalactic legacy fields with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) imager on the CTIO 4m Blanco telescope. Since Feb 2019, HELM has been monitoring regions within COSMOS, XMM-LSS, CDF-S, S-CVZ, ELAIS-S1, and SDSS Stripe 82 with few-day cadences in the $(u)gri(z)$ bands, over a collective sky area of $\sim 38$ deg${\rm ^2}$. The main science goal of HELM is to provide high-quality optical light curves for a large sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and to build decades-long time baselines when combining past and future optical light curves in these legacy fields. These optical images and light curves will facilitate the measurements of AGN reverberation mapping lags, as well as studies of AGN variability and its dependences on accretion properties. In addition, the time-resolved and coadded DECam photometry will enable a broad range of science applications from galaxy evolution to time-domain science. We describe the design and implementation of the program and present the first data release that includes source catalogs and the first $\sim 3.5$ years of light curves during 2019A--2022A.

  We study "buried" active galactic nuclei (AGNs) almost fully covered by circumnuclear material in ultra-/luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs), which show weak ionized lines from narrow line regions. Employing an indicator of [O IV] 25.89-um or [Ne V] 14.32-um line to 12-um AGN luminosity ratio, we find 17 buried AGN candidates that are [O IV]-weak ($L_{\rm [O\,IV]}$/$L_{\rm 12,AGN} \leq -$3.0) or [Ne V]-weak ($L_{\rm [Ne\,V]}$/$L_{\rm 12,AGN} \leq -$3.4) among 30 AGNs in local U/LIRGs. For the [O IV]-weak AGNs, we estimate their covering fractions of Compton-thick (CT; $N_{\rm H} \geq 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) material with an X-ray clumpy torus model to be $f^{\rm (spec)}_{\rm CT} = 0.55\pm0.19$ on average. This value is consistent with the fraction of CT AGNs ($f^{\rm (stat)}_{\rm CT} = 53\pm12$%) among the [O IV]-weak AGNs in U/LIRGs and much larger than that in Swift/BAT AGNs ($23\pm6$%). The fraction of [O IV]-weak AGNs increases from $27^{+13}_{-10}$% (early) to $66^{+10}_{-12}$% (late mergers). Similar results are obtained with the [Ne V] line. The [O IV] or [Ne V]-weak AGNs in late mergers show larger $N_{\rm H}$ and Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) than those of the Swift/BAT AGNs, and the largest $N_{\rm H}$ is $\gtrsim$10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ at ${\log}\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim -$1, close to the effective Eddington limit for CT material. These suggest that (1) the circumnuclear material in buried AGNs is regulated by the radiation force from high-$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ AGNs on the CT obscurers, and (2) their dense material with large $f^{\rm (spec)}_{\rm CT}$ ($\sim 0.5 \pm 0.1$) in U/LIRGs is a likely cause of a unique structure of buried AGNs, whose amount of material may be maintained through merger-induced supply from their host galaxies.
