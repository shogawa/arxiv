  We present the results of a joint {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR} campaign on the active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 4329A, consisting of 9 $\times$ 20 ks {\it XMM-Newton} observations, and 5 $\times$ 20 ks {\it NuSTAR} observations within nine days, performed in August 2021. Within each observation, the AGN is not very variable, with the fractional variability never exceeding 5%. Flux variations are observed between the different observations, on timescales of days, with a 30% ratio between the minimum and the maximum 2-10 keV flux. These variations follow the softer-when-brighter behavior typically observed in AGN. In all observations, a soft excess is clearly present. Consistently with previous observations, the X-ray spectra of the source exhibit a cut-off energy between 140 and 250 keV, constant within the error in the different observations. We detected a narrow iron \ka line consistent with being constant during the monitoring, and likely originating in a distant neutral medium. We do not find evidence of a broad component of the iron line, suggesting that the inner disk does not produce strong reflection. We find that the reflection component is weak ($R_{\rm max}=0.009\pm0.002$). We also found the presence of a warm absorber component together with an ultra-fast outflow. Looking at their energetic, these outflows have enough mechanical power to exercise a significant feedback impact on the AGN surrounding environment.

  Narrow Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent emission lines arising at $\sim$kpc-scale separations from the nucleus have only been detected in a few AGN. The detections require that the extended line emission be spatially resolved and sufficiently bright. Compared to narrow Fe K$\alpha$ lines arising closer to the nucleus, they have much lower fluxes but show substantially larger equivalent widths, EW$_{\rm Fe K\alpha}$. We show that, in the optically-thin limit, a purely analytical argument naturally predicts large, EW$_{\rm FeK\alpha}\sim$1 keV, values for such lines, regardless of the details of equivalent hydrogen column density, $N_H$, or reprocessor geometry. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate this result and show that the simple analytic EW$_{\rm FeK\alpha}$ prescription holds up to higher $N_H$ approaching the Compton-thick regime. We compare to $Chandra$ observations from the literature and discuss that our results are consistent with the large EW$_{\rm FeK\alpha}$ values reported for local AGN, for which the line is detected in extended, up to $\sim$kpc-scale, regions. We argue that large EW$_{\rm FeK\alpha}$ from kpc-scale regions in AGN should be ubiquitous, because they do not depend on the absolute luminosity of the central X-ray source, and are measured only against the scattered continuum. We predict values to be of the order of $\sim$1 keV or larger, even for covering factors $\ll$1, and for arbitrarily small column densities. We propose that the large-scale molecular material that is now routinely being detected with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) may act as an extended X-ray scattering reprocessor giving rise to $\sim$kpc-scale Fe K$\alpha$ emission.

  We present the identification of 42 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (type-2 AGN) candidates in the two deepest observations of the JADES spectroscopic survey with JWST/NIRSpec. The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allow us to select narrow-line AGNs based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z=10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at $z&gt;3$ the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation. Therefore, we also use high ionisation lines, such as HeII$\lambda$4686, HeII$\lambda$1640, NeIV$\lambda$2422, NeV$\lambda$3420, and NV$\lambda$1240, also in combination with other UV transitions, to trace the presence of AGN. Out of a parent sample of 209 galaxies, we identify 42 type-2 AGN (although 10 of them are tentative), giving a fraction of galaxies in JADES hosting type-2 AGN of about $20\pm3$\%, which does not evolve significantly in the redshift range between 2 and 10. The selected type-2 AGN have estimated bolometric luminosities of $10^{41.3-44.9}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and host-galaxy stellar masses of $10^{7.2-9.3}$ M$_{\odot}$. The star formation rates of the selected AGN host galaxies are consistent with those of the star-forming main sequence. The AGN host galaxies at z=4-6 contribute $\sim$8-30 \% to the UV luminosity function, slightly increasing with UV luminosity.
