  Ciii]{\lambda}{\lambda}1907, 1909 doublet emission line is a valuable tool for exploring early star-forming galaxies. It has been proposed as a potential alternative to the diminishing Ly{\alpha}{\lambda}1215.7 line for tracing galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization. In this study, we investigate the utility of the Ciii] line as a proxy for Ly{\alpha} in the reionization era by comparing the equivalent widths (EW) and velocity offsets of both emission lines. Our analysis focuses on star-forming galaxies at z \sim 3 - 4 from the VANDELS survey. We examined the spectra of 773 objects, identifying the rest-frame UV line Ciii]. Subsequently, we measured the EW of Ciii], Ly{\alpha}, and Heii. For objects displaying both Ciii] and Ly{\alpha} emission, the Ly{\alpha} velocity offsets was calculated. After removing 10 potential AGNs from our analysis, we detected Ciii] emission in 280/773 galaxies, with 139 receiving the highest confidence rating. The EW(Ciii]) had an average \sim 6 {\AA}, while EW(Ly{\alpha}) had an average \sim 18 {\AA}. Among the subset that showed both Ciii] and Ly{\alpha} (52/139), the average EW(Ciii]) was \sim 5 {\AA}, higher than those without Ly{\alpha} (EW(Ciii]) \sim 3 {\AA}). Additionally, all 52 galaxies in the Ciii] and Ly{\alpha} subset displayed a velocity shift ({\Delta}v_{Ly{\alpha}}), with average offset 533 km/s. This expanded dataset provides valuable insights, including a positive correlation between EW(Ciii]) and EW(Ly{\alpha}), confirming earlier findings. Furthermore, we report a promising anti-correlation between EW(Ciii]) and {\Delta}v_{Ly{\alpha}}, which may serve as a tool for inferring Ly{\alpha} properties and potentially detecting ionized bubbles at z \gt 6.

  Over its 13 years of operation (1990 -- 2002), the Faint Object Camera (FOC) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observed 26 individual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in ultraviolet (UV) imaging polarimetry. However, not all of the observations have been reduced and analyzed or set within a standardized framework. We plan to reduce and analyze the AGN observations that have been neglected in the FOC archives using a consistent, novel, and open-access reduction pipeline of our own. We then extend the method to the full AGN sample, thus leading to potential discoveries in the near future. We developed a new pipeline in Python that will be able to reduce all the FOC observations in imaging polarimetry in a homogeneous way. Most of the previously published reduced observations are dispersed throughout the literature, with the range of different analyses and approaches making it difficult to fully interpret the FOC AGN sample. By standardizing the method, we have enabled a coherent comparison among the different observational sets. In this first paper of a series exploring the full HST/FOC AGN sample, we present an exhaustively detailed account of how to properly reduce the observational data. Current progress in data-analysis is implemented in and has provided state-of-the-art UV polarimetric maps. We compare our new maps to the benchmark AGN case of NGC~1068 and successfully reproduce the main results previously published, while pushing the polarimetric exploration of this AGN futher, thanks to a finer resolution and a higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) than previously reported. We also present, for the first time, an optical polarimetric map of the radio-loud AGN IC~5063 and we examine the complex interactions between the AGN outflows and the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM).

  One of the key questions on active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy clusters is how AGN could affect the formation and evolution of member galaxies and galaxy clusters in the history of the Universe. To address this issue, we investigate the dependence of AGN number fraction ($f_{\rm AGN}$) on cluster redshift ($z_{\rm cl}$) and distance from the cluster center ($R/R_{\rm 200}$). We focus on more than 27,000 galaxy groups and clusters at $0.1 &lt; z_{\rm cl} &lt; 1.4$ with more than 1 million member galaxies selected from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. By combining various AGN selection methods based on infrared (IR), radio, and X-ray data, we identify 2,688 AGN. We find that (i) $f_{\rm AGN}$ increases with $z_{\rm cl}$ and (ii) $f_{\rm AGN}$ decreases with $R/R_{\rm 200}$. The main contributors to the rapid increase of $f_{\rm AGN}$ towards high-$z$ and cluster center are IR- and radio-selected AGN, respectively. Those results indicate that the emergence of the AGN population depends on the environment and redshift, and galaxy groups and clusters at high-$z$ play an important role in AGN evolution. We also find that cluster-cluster mergers may not drive AGN activity in at least the cluster center, while we have tentative evidence that cluster-cluster mergers would enhance AGN activity in the outskirts of (particularly massive) galaxy clusters.

  In this letter, we report the discovery of a fast neutral hydrogen outflow in SDSS J145239.38+062738.0, a merging radio galaxy containing an optical type I active galactic nuclei (AGN). This discovery was made through observations conducted by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) using redshifted 21-cm absorption. The outflow exhibits a blueshifted velocity likely up to $\sim-1000\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy with an absorption strength of $\sim -0.6\,\rm mJy\,beam^{-1}$ corresponding to an optical depth of 0.002 at $v=-500\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. The mass outflow rate ranges between $2.8\times10^{-2}$ and $3.6\, \rm M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$, implying an energy outflow rate ranging between $4.2\times10^{39}$ and $9.7\times10^{40}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$, assuming 100 K $&lt;T_{\rm s}&lt;$ 1000 K. Plausible drivers of the outflow include the star bursts, the AGN radiation, and the radio jet, the last of which is considered the most likely culprit according to the kinematics. By analysing the properties of the outflow, the AGN, and the jet, we find that if the HI outflow is driven by the AGN radiation, the AGN radiation seems not powerful enough to provide negative feedback whereas the radio jet shows the potential to provide negative feedback. Our observations contribute another example of a fast outflow detected in neutral hydrogen, as well as demonstrate the capability of FAST in detecting such outflows.

  Most of the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are radio-quiet (RQ) and, differently from radio-loud (RL) AGN, do not show signature of large-scale and powerful jets. The physical origin of their radio emission remains then broadly unclear. The observation of flat/inverted radio spectra at GHz frequencies seems to support however the presence of an unresolved synchrotron self-absorbed region in the close environment of the supermassive black hole. Its size could be as small as that of the X-ray corona. Since synchrotron self absorption decreases strongly with frequency, these sources need to be observed in the millimetric (mm) domain. We report here a 12h simultaneous mm-X-ray observation of the RQ AGN MCG+08-11-11 by NOEMA and NuSTAR. The mm flux shows a weak but clear increase along the pointing with a fractional variability of $2.0\pm0.1$\%. The 3-10 keV flux of NuSTAR also increases and shows a fractional variability of $7.0\pm1.5$\%. A structure function analysis shows a local maximum in the mm light curve corresponding to 2-3\% of variability on timescale of $\sim2\times10^4$ seconds (100-300 $R_g$ light crossing time). Assuming an optically thick mm emitting medium, this translates into an upper limit of its size of $\sim$1300 $R_g$. The observation of fast variability in radio-mm and X-ray wavelengths, as well as a similar variability trend, well support the mm emission to be emitted by a region close, and potentially related to, the X-ray corona like an outflow/weak jet.

  Compact obscured nuclei (CONs) are relatively common in the centers of local (U)LIRGs, yet their nature remains unknown. Both AGN activity and extreme nuclear starbursts have been suggested as plausible nuclear power sources. The prevalence of outflows in these systems suggest that CONs represent a key phase in the nuclear feedback cycle, in which material is ejected from the central regions of the galaxy. Here, we present results from MUSE for the confirmed local CON galaxy NGC4418. For the first time we spatially map the spectral features and kinematics of the galaxy in the optical, revealing several previously unknown structures. In particular, we discover a bilateral outflow along the minor axis, an outflowing bubble, several knot structures and a receding outflow partially obscured by the galactic disk. Based on the properties of these features, we conclude that the CON in NGC4418 is most likely powered by an AGN.   

Similarity between compact extremely red objects discovered with JWST in
  cosmic dawn and blue-excess dust-obscured galaxies known in cosmic noon

  Spatially compact objects with extremely red color in the rest-frame optical to near-infrared (0.4--3.0 ${\rm \mu m}$) and blue color in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV; 0.2--0.4 ${\rm \mu m}$) have been discovered at $5 &lt; z &lt; 9$ using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). These extremely red objects (JWST-EROs) exhibit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that are difficult to explain using a single component of either star-forming galaxies or quasars, leading to two-component models in which the blue UV and extremely red optical are explained using less-dusty and dusty spectra of galaxies or quasars, respectively. Here, we report the remarkable similarity in SEDs between JWST-EROs and blue-excess dust-obscured galaxies (BluDOGs) identified at $2 &lt; z &lt; 3$. BluDOGs are a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with blackhole masses of $\sim10^{8-9}$ M$_\odot$, which are one order of magnitude larger than those in some JWST-EROs. The Eddington accretion rates of BluDOGs are one or higher, whereas those of JWST-EROs are in the range of 0.1--1. Therefore, JWST-EROs are less massive, less active, and more common counterparts in higher-$z$ of BluDOGs in cosmic noon. Conversely, JWST-EROs have a significantly higher fraction of those with blue-excess than DOGs. We present the average UV spectra of BluDOGs as a comparison to JWST-EROs and discuss a coherent evolutionary scenario for dusty AGN populations.   

Are there higher electron densities in narrow emission line regions of
  Type-1 AGN than Type-2 AGN?

  In the manuscript, we check properties of electron densities $n_e$ traced by flux ratio $R_{sii}$ of [S~{\sc ii}]$\lambda6716$\AA~ to [S~{\sc ii}]$\lambda6731$\AA~ in narrow emission line regions (NLRs) between Type-1 AGN and Type-2 AGN in SDSS DR12. Under the framework of Unified Model considering kpc-scale structures, similar $n_e$ in NLRs should be expected between Type-1 AGN and Type-2 AGN. Based on reliable measurements of [S~{\sc ii}] doublet with measured parameters at least five times larger than corresponding uncertainties, there are 6039 Type-1 AGN and 8725 Type-2 AGN (excluding the Type-2 LINERs and the composite galaxies) collected from SDSS DR12. Then, lower $R_{sii}$ (higher $n_e$) in NLRs can be well confirmed in Type-1 AGN than in Type-2 AGN, with confidence level higher than 5$\sigma$, even after considering necessary effects including effects of electron temperatures traced by [O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda4364,4959,5007$\AA~ on estimating $n_e$ in NLRs. Two probable methods are proposed to explain the higher $n_e$ in NLRs in Type-1 AGN. First, the higher $n_e$ in NLRs of Type-1 AGN could indicate longer time durations of AGN activities in Type-1 AGN than in Type-2 AGN, if AGN activities triggering galactic-scale outflows leading to more electrons injecting into NLRs were accepted to explain the higher $n_e$ in NLRs of Type-2 AGN than HII galaxies. Second, the lower $n_e$ in NLRs of Type-2 AGN could be explained by stronger star-forming contributions in Type-2 AGN, considering lower $n_e$ in HII regions. The results provide interesting challenges to the commonly and widely accepted Unified Model of AGN.
