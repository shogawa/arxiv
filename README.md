  The astrophysical origin of binary black hole mergers discovered by LIGO and Virgo remains uncertain. Efforts to reconstruct the processes that lead to mergers typically rely on either astrophysical models with fixed parameters, or continuous analytical models that can be fit to observations. Given the complexity of astrophysical formation mechanisms, these methods typically cannot fully take into account model uncertainties, nor can they fully capture the underlying processes. Here, we present a merger population analysis that can take a discrete set of simulated model distributions as its input to interpret observations. The analysis can take into account multiple formation scenarios as fractional contributors to the total set of observations, and can naturally account for model uncertainties. We apply this technique to investigate the origin of black hole mergers observed by LIGO Virgo. Specifically, we consider a model of AGN assisted black hole merger distributions, exploring a range of AGN parameters along with several {{SEVN}} population synthesis models that vary in common envelope efficiency parameter ($\alpha$) and metallicity ($Z$). We estimate the posterior distributions for AGN+SEVN models using $87$ BBH detections from the $O1--O3$ observation runs. The inferred total merger rate is $46.2 {Gpc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}$, with the AGN sub-population contributing $21.2{Gpc}^{-3}{yr}^{-1}$ and the SEVN sub-population contributing $25.0 {Gpc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}$.

  We report the discovery of an extremely high-velocity outflow (EHVO) in the most luminous ($L\rm_{Bol}$ $\sim$ 2.29 $\times$ 10$^{48}$ erg/s) QSO, SMSS J2157-3602, at z=4.692. Combined XSHOOTER and NIRES observations reveal that the EHVO reaches a maximum velocity of v$_\mathrm{max} \sim 0.13c$ and persists over rest-frame timescales of a few months to one year. SMSS J2157-3602 also exhibits one of the highest balnicity index discovered in an EHVO so far. In addition, the blueshifted CIV emission traces a high-velocity (v$\rm_{CIV}^{50}\sim$ 4660 km/s) outflow from the broad-line region. Thanks to an XMM-Newton observation, we also discover the X-ray weak nature of this QSO, which likely prevents the overionization of the innermost disk atmosphere and facilitates the efficient launch of the detected EHVO and BLR winds. The extraordinary luminosity of SMSS J2157-3602 and the extreme velocity of the EHVO make it a unique laboratory for testing AGN driven feedback under extreme conditions. Current uncertainties on the outflow's location and column density strengthen the case for dedicated follow-up, which will be essential to assess the full feedback potential of this remarkable quasar.
