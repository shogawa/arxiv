  We present star formation rates (SFR), the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), and the SFR-dependent MZR across redshifts 4 to 10 using 81 star-forming galaxies observed by the JWST NIRSpec employing both low-resolution PRISM and medium-resolution gratings, including galaxies from the JADES GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields, the JWST-PRIMAL Legacy Survey, and additional galaxies from the literature in Abell 2744, SMACS-0723, RXJ2129, BDF, COSMOS, and MACS1149 fields. These galaxies span a 3 dex stellar mass range of $10^7 &lt; M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} &lt; 10^{10}$, with an average SFR of $7.2 \pm 1.2 M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ and an average metallicity of $12+{\rm log(O/H)} = 7.91 \pm 0.08$. Our findings align with previous observations up to $z=8$ for the MZR and indicate no deviation from local universe FMR up to this redshift. Beyond $z=8$, we observe a significant deviation $\sim 0.27$ dex) in FMR, consistent with recent JWST findings. We also integrate CEERS (135 galaxies) and JADES (47 galaxies) samples with our data to study metallicity evolution with redshift in a combined sample of 263 galaxies, revealing a decreasing metallicity trend with a slope of $0.067 \pm 0.013$, consistent with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, but contradicts with FIRE simulations. We introduce an empirical mass-metallicity-redshift (MZ-$z$ relation): $12+{\rm log(O/H)}=6.29 + 0.237 \times{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) - 0.06 \times (1+z)$, which accurately reproduces the observed trends in metallicity with both redshift and stellar mass. This trend underscores the ``Grand Challenge'' in understanding the factors driving high-redshift galactic metallicity trends, such as inflow, outflow, and AGN/stellar feedback -- and emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger samples and enhanced simulations.

  In non-star-forming, passively evolving galaxies, regions with emission lines dominated by low-ionization species are classified as Low-Ionization Emission Regions (LIERs). The ionization mechanism behind such regions has long been a mystery. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), which were once believed to be the source, have been found not to be the dominant mechanism, especially in regions distant from the galaxy nuclei. The remaining candidates, photoionization by post-Asymtopic Giant Branch (pAGB) stars and interstellar shocks can only be distinguished with in-depth analysis. As the temperature predictions of these two models differ, temperature measurements can provide strong constraints on this puzzle. We selected a sample of 2795 quiescent red-sequence galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. We divided the sample spectra into three groups based on their [N II]/H$\alpha$ flux ratio and utilized stacking techniques to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the observed spectra. We determined the temperature of [O III], [N II], [S II], and [O II] through their temperature-sensitive emission line ratios. Subsequently, we compared the measured temperatures with predictions from different models. The results demonstrate consistency with the interstellar shock model with preshock density n = 1 cm$^{-3}$ and solar metallicity, thus supporting shocks as the dominant ionization source of LIERs. Additionally, we also find that the interstellar dust extinction value measured through the Balmer decrement appears to be larger than that implied by the forbidden line ratios of low-ionization lines.   

The Small Sizes and High Implied Densities of `Little Red Dots' with
  Balmer Breaks Could Explain Their Broad Emission Lines Without an AGN

  Early JWST studies found an apparent population of massive, compact galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim7$. Recently three of these galaxies were shown to have prominent Balmer breaks, demonstrating that their light at $\lambda_{\rm rest} \sim 3500$ $\r{A}$ is dominated by a stellar population that is relatively old ($\sim$200 Myr). All three also have broad H$\beta$ emission with $\sigma &gt; 1000 \,\rm km s^{-1}$, a common feature of such `little red dots'. From S\'ersic profile fits to the NIRCam images in F200W we find that the stellar light of galaxies is extremely compact: the galaxies have half-light radii of $r_{\rm e}\sim$ 100 pc, in the regime of ultra compact dwarfs in the nearby Universe. Their masses are uncertain, as they depend on the contribution of possible light from an AGN to the flux at $\lambda_{\rm rest}&gt;5000$ $\r{A}$. If the AGN contribution is low beyond the Balmer break region, the masses are $M_* \sim 10^{10}-10^{11}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and the central densities are higher than those of any other known galaxy population by an order of magnitude. Interestingly, the implied velocity dispersions of $\sim$1500 kms$^{-1}$ are in very good agreement with the measured H$\beta$ line widths. We suggest that some of the broad lines in `little red dots' are not due to AGNs but simply reflect the kinematics of the galaxies, and speculate that the galaxies are observed in a short-lived phase where the central densities are much higher than at later times. We stress, however, that the canonical interpretation of AGNs causing the broad H$\beta$ lines also remains viable.
