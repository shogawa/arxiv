  The ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 00183-7111 ($z=0.328$) is one of the three ULIRGs that are currently known to host an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with young radio jets. We present a detailed study of the link between galaxy merger, AGN ignition, radio jet expansion and galactic-scale molecular outflow in IRAS 00183-7111, using high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(3-2) lines and very deep $i$-band VLT Survey Telescope (VST) imaging. The latter allows us to put - for the first time - tight constraints on the assembly history of the system, confirming that it formed through a major merger between two gas-rich spirals, likely characterised by a prograde encounter and no older than 2 Gyr. The recent merger channelled about $(1.0\pm0.1)\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas in the central regions of the remnant, as traced by the CO detections. The spatial correlation between the CO distribution and the radio core suggests that this gas likely contributed to the ignition of the AGN and thus to the launch of the radio jets, which are no older than 2 Myr. Furthermore, by comparing the relative strength of the two CO transitions, we find extreme gas excitation (i.e. $T_{\rm ex}\gg50$ K) around the radio lobes, supporting the case for a jet-ISM interaction. A qualitative study of the CO kinematics also demonstrates that, despite the overall disturbed dynamical state with no clear signs of regular rotation, at least one non-rotational kinematic component can be identified and likely associated to an outflow with $v_{\rm out}\approx 556$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M_{\rm out}}\approx 110$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

  The local Seyfert 1.5 active galactic nucleus (AGN), NGC 6814, is known to exhibit complex variability, eclipses, and even changing-look behaviour. In this work, we utilize optical-to-X-ray data obtained over 10-years with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to examine the short-term (i.e. daily) and long-term (yearly) variations in the spectral energy distribution (SED). This includes three epochs of high-cadence monitoring (2012, 2016, and 2022), as well as two single observations (2019 and 2021). Model-independent methods of examining the variability suggest that the three monitored epochs exhibit distinct behaviour. X-ray weakness in 2016 can be attributed to the previously studied eclipses, while similar behaviour in 2012 is associated with continuum changes and slight neutral absorption. The multi-epoch SED models are consistent with a black hole (log (MBH / Msun) ~7.6) that is accreting between 0.01-0.1 of the Eddington rate. While the corona (primary X-ray source) is compact, all epochs are better fit with an accretion disk inner radius that is much larger than the innermost stable circular orbit, implying the possibility of a non-standard accretion disk or central structure in NGC 6814.

  The profiles of broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide critical insights into the geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR), which in turn influence the uncertainties in estimating the masses of central supermassive black holes. In this study, we report the discovery of a low-luminosity AGN, SDSS J1609+4902, in which the H$\alpha$ line exhibits two distinct BLR components: a Gaussian component and an extremely broad double-peaked component. Follow-up observations conducted at the Lijiang Observatory in 2025 reveal that the line profile remains roughly unchanged, suggesting that this BLR structure may remain stable over a timescale of $\sim$10 years. We find that the size of the central Gaussian (Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM$\sim 3000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$) component is consistent with the classical reverberation mapping correlation. In contrast, the asymmetric double-peaked wing (FWHM$\sim 23,000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$) likely originates from a disk-like BLR with an inner radius of approximately 70 gravitational radii. These results provide new constraints on the structure and dynamics of BLRs in AGNs and highlight the potential for long-term stability in such systems.

  He II $\lambda$1640 emission in galaxies indicates the presence of sources that produce extreme ionizing photons. Here, we report the discovery of a He II $\lambda$1640 emitting galaxy, GNHeII J1236+6215, at $z=$ 2.9803 in the GOODS-north field. We use photometry in 17 wavebands from near-UV to infrared to characterize the galaxy SED and combine Keck LRIS and JWST NIRSpec spectra to identify 15 emission lines including He II $\lambda$1640. We infer that the He$^+$ ionization in the galaxy could be driven by small pockets of young Population III stars or low-metallicity Very Massive Stars (VMSs) rather than AGN or metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars. The galaxy has a highly ionized ISM ([OIII]5007/[OII]3727 = 7.28$\pm$0.11, [SIII]/[SII] = 1.97$\pm$0.48 and detected Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$ lines), little reddening by dust (E(B$-$V) = 0.04$\pm$0.12), low metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 7.85$\pm$0.22), and high star formation rate (SFR$_{\rm SED}$ = 12.2$\pm$2.0 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). In addition to these ISM conditions, we also notice a significant [SII] deficiency ([SII]6718,6732/H$\alpha$ = 0.08$\pm$0.02, $\Delta$[SII] = $-$0.12) which may indicate the presence of density-bounded optically thin H~II regions that combined with the low dust extinction favor leaking of ionizing Lyman continuum (LyC) photons. Our best-fit SED model also infers a high nebular ionization (log U = $-2.0$) and a low stellar mass M = 7.8$\pm3.1\times$10$^8$M$_{\odot}$. This discovery not only adds one important object to the known sample of high-redshift He~II emitters but also highlights a potential connection between He$^+$ ionization and favorable ISM conditions for the leakage of ionizing photons from galaxies.

  The compact mm emission ubiquitously found in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGN) exhibits properties consistent with synchrotron radiation from a small region ($\leq$1 light day) and undergoing self-absorption below $\sim$100 GHz. Several scenarios have been proposed for its origin, including an X-ray corona, a scaled-down jet, or outflow-driven shocks, which can be tested via mm polarimetry. In the optically thin regime, synchrotron emission is expected to show polarization up to $\sim$70\%, but disordered magnetic fields and Faraday rotation reduce this to a few percent for jets and outflows, while an X-ray corona is likely to result in complete depolarization. To investigate this, we conducted the first ALMA Band 3 full-polarization observations of three RQ AGN - NGC 3783, MCG 5-23-16, and NGC 4945. No polarized signal was detected in any of the AGN, with an upper limit of 0.5-1.5\%, supporting the X-ray corona scenario. However, we detected a compact source with 17\% polarization in NGC 3783, 20 pc away from the AGN, co-spatial with the mm and narrow-line outflow, likely linked to a shock propagating through the outflowing material. Additionally, combining our data with archival ALMA observations, we found typical mm variability in RQ AGN by a factor of 2; however, the sparsity of the data prevented a more detailed analysis of the total flux variability.

  Jellyfish galaxies are extreme examples of how galaxies can transform due to dense environmental effects. These satellite galaxies suffer from ram-pressure stripping, leading to the formation of their distinctive gaseous tails. Some recent observational studies find that jellyfish galaxies are more likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGN) compared to central galaxies of the same mass, suggesting a link between ram pressure and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological-magnetohydrodynamical simulations, namely TNG50 and TNG100, to explore the presence of AGN in jellyfish galaxies with $M_{\rm{stellar}}\simeq10^{9.5-10.8}\,\rm{M}_\odot$ at redshift $z=0$ from the Zooniverse "Cosmological Jellyfish" citizen-science project. Compared to central galaxies, jellyfish are more likely to host an AGN ($L_{\rm AGN}\geq10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) particularly at high stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\gtrsim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Jellyfish are also more likely to host an AGN than satellites of the same mass, largely because many satellite galaxies are gas-poor and therefore have lower SMBH accretion rates. Compared to non-jellyfish satellites with similar gas content, jellyfish typically undergo stronger ram pressure and have higher central gas densities along with lower central gas sound speeds, although these effects are smaller at lower stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\lesssim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Together with case studies of individual galaxies, our population analysis indicates that ram pressure can play a key role in fuelling AGN activity in a large fraction of jellyfish, where gas compression can lead to intense episodes of AGN feedback and star formation. Thus, it is essential to consider both environmental and secular processes for a more complete picture of satellite galaxy evolution.

  Multiple clumpy wind components ($v_{out}\sim0.2-0.3c$) in the luminous quasar PDS 456 have recently been resolved by XRISM in the Fe-K band for the first time. In this paper, we investigate the structure of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) using coordinated observations from XRISM, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, along with the self-consistently calculated photoionization model \texttt{PION}. Our results reveal a stratified ionization structure likely driven by the radiation field, characterized by a relation between wind velocity and ionization parameter $v_{out}\propto\xi^{(0.38\pm0.06)}$. To evaluate the impact of the screening effect, we tested all possible order permutations of six \texttt{PION} components. We find that highly ionized UFOs ($\log\xi&gt;4.5$) are insensitive to their relative positions, whereas the soft X-ray UFO ($\log\xi\sim3$ and $v_{out}\sim0.27c$) and the lowest-ionized hard X-ray UFO ($\log\xi\sim4.1$ and $v_ {out}\sim0.23c$) are statistically favored -- based on the evidence from both the C-statistic and Bayesian analysis -- to occupy the middle and innermost layers, respectively. This suggests a possible trend where slower UFOs are launched from regions closer to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The soft X-ray UFO is found to be thermally unstable, regardless of its relative position. However, its location remains unclear. Our sequence analysis and its similarity to hard X-ray UFOs suggest that they may be co-spatial, while variability constraints support its location within the broad-line region at sub-parsec scales. Simulations with the gate-valve opened XRISM show that high-resolution soft X-ray data can enhance the reliability of our results. Furthermore, simulations with the future X-ray mission NewAthena demonstrate its capability to resolve the absorber sequence and spatial distributions, enabling the determination of UFO structures and their roles in AGN feedback.

  Feedback from supernovae and AGN shapes galaxy formation and evolution, yet its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray (ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population. Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about 0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups and hydro simulations.

  The nature of the obscuring material in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be studied by measuring changes in the line-of-sight column density, $N_{\rm H,los}$, over time. This can be accomplished by monitoring AGN over long periods of time and at all timescales. However, this can only be done for a few selected objects as it is resource intensive. Therefore, the best option currently is to focus on population statistics based on the available archival data. In this work, we estimate a lower limit on the fraction of sources in the local $(z&lt;0.1)$ universe that display spectral variability among observations ($54\pm11$%), indicative of $N_{\rm H,los}$ variability. Interestingly, we also find that the variable fraction is similar for both Seyfert 1 ($f_{\rm Sy1}\sim61^{+13}_{-15}$%) and Seyfert 2 ($f_{\rm Sy2}\sim47\pm15$%) galaxies, and discuss why we might find a slightly higher $f_{\rm Sy1}$. We also present a sample of 43 Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies with multiple Chandra observations whose properties make them promising $N_{\rm H,los}$-variable targets. We discuss the accuracy of our method, and search for potential dependencies on the timescale between variable and non-variable observation pairs within a given source. In agreement with previous studies, we find evidence that more variability occurs on longer timescales than on shorter timescales.   

JWST Insights into Narrow-line Little Red Dots

  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z &gt;= 4 known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)

  We present flux measurements of the coronal lines [Fe VII] and [Fe X] spanning three decades, in the highly variable Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) MKN 110. These coronal lines are sensitive to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGNs in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Neither [Fe VII] nor [Fe X] demonstrates variability in the short term on a weekly or monthly timescale. However, by taking advantage of a long term decrease in the continuum flux of MKN 110 on the order of years, we were able to track the [Fe VII] and [Fe X] fluxes as they respond to the continuum. We were able to detect a lag for [Fe VII] relative to the continuum at 5100 {\AA}, with a modal lag of 652 days, but were unable to detect a significant lag in the [Fe x] flux, though there exist significant uncertainties in the [Fe X] fit. These two lag results are not consistent and the line widths for the two line species also do not match. This provides strong evidence for stratification within the coronal line region (CLR). There is also evidence of a non-varying component within the coronal line flux, probably a result of a more extended region of origin. Taken together, these results suggest a CLR where the bulk of the [Fe VII] originates on parsec scales, but a portion of the [Fe VII] flux originates further out, at or beyond a 10 pc scale. These results also indicate the limitations of single-cloud models in describing the physical conditions of the CLR.

  Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range $z$ $\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the $\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.
