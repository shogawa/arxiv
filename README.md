  One of the key open questions in Cosmology is the nature of the sources that completed the cosmological hydrogen Reionization at z~5.2. High-z primeval galaxies have been long considered the main drivers for Reionization, with a minor role played by high-z AGN. However, in order to confirm this scenario, it is fundamental to measure the photo-ionization rate produced by active SMBHs close to the epoch of Reionization. Given the pivotal role played by spectroscopically complete observations of high-z QSOs, in this paper we present the first results of the RUBICON (Reionizing the Universe with BrIght COsmological Nuclei) survey. It consists of a color selected sample of bona-fide z~5 QSO candidates from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey. Our QSO candidates have been validated both by photometric redshifts based on SED fitting and by spectroscopic redshifts, confirming that they lie at 4.5&lt;z_spec&lt;5.2. A relatively large space density of QSOs (Phi~1.4x10^-8 cMpc^-3) is thus confirmed at z~5 and M1450~-27, consistent with a pure density evolution of the AGN luminosity function from z=4 to z=5, with a mild density evolution rate of 0.25 dex. This indicates that AGN could play a non-negligible role in the cosmic Reionization. The Rubicon of Reionization has been crossed.

  Real extreme/intermediate mass ratio inspiral(E/IMRI) systems are likely to contain large accretion disks which could be as massive as the central supermassive black hole. Therefore, contrary to its ideal model, a real E/IMRI system contains a third important component: the accretion disk. We study the influence of these disks on the emitted GW profile and its detectability through proposed LISA observation. We use a semi-relativistic formalism in the Kerr background (Gair &amp; Glampedakis 2006; Barausse &amp; Rezzolla 2008) for the case of transonic accretion flow which is a potential candidate to describe the accretion flows around AGN. The hydrodynamic drag of the disks modified the motion of the companion as a result the emitted wave changes in amplitude and phase. We found that these changes are detectable through the last few years of observation by LISA (in some cases as small as six months) for EMRIs residing within 3 GPc from the detector and for the accretion rate of the primary black hole of the order of $\dot{M}=1 \dot{M}_{Edd}$. These choices of parameter values are consistent with real systems. The drag effect and hence the detectability of the emitted GW is sensitive to the hydrodynamical model of the disk. Therefore such observations will help one to identify the nature of the accretion flow and verify various paradigms of accretion physics.

  Classifying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a challenge, especially for BL Lac Objects (BLLs), which are identified by their weak emission line spectra. To address the problem of classification, we use data from the 4th Fermi Catalog, Data Release 3. Missing data hinders the use of machine learning to classify AGN. A previous paper found that Multiple Imputation by Chain Equations (MICE) imputation is useful for estimating missing values. Since many AGN have missing redshift and the highest energy, we use data imputation with MICE and K-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm to fill in these missing variables. Then, we classify AGN into the BLLs or the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) using the SuperLearner, an ensemble method that includes several classification algorithms like logistic regression, support vector classifiers, Random Forests, Ranger Random Forests, multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), Bayesian regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting. We find that a SuperLearner model using MARS regression and Random Forests algorithms is 91.1% accurate for kNN imputed data and 91.2% for MICE imputed data. Furthermore, the kNN-imputed SuperLearner model predicts that 892 of the 1519 unclassified blazars are BLLs and 627 are Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), while the MICE-imputed SuperLearner model predicts 890 BLLs and 629 FSRQs in the unclassified set. Thus, we can conclude that both imputation methods work efficiently and with high accuracy and that our methodology ushers the way for using SuperLearner as a novel classification method in the AGN community and, in general, in the astrophysics community.

  We quantify the cosmological spread of baryons relative to their initial neighboring dark matter distribution using thousands of state-of-the-art simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project. We show that dark matter particles spread relative to their initial neighboring distribution owing to chaotic gravitational dynamics on spatial scales comparable to their host dark matter halo. In contrast, gas in hydrodynamic simulations spreads much further from the initial neighboring dark matter owing to feedback from supernovae (SNe) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We show that large-scale baryon spread is very sensitive to model implementation details, with the fiducial \textsc{SIMBA} model spreading $\sim$40\% of baryons $&gt;$1\,Mpc away compared to $\sim$10\% for the IllustrisTNG and \textsc{ASTRID} models. Increasing the efficiency of AGN-driven outflows greatly increases baryon spread while increasing the strength of SNe-driven winds can decrease spreading due to non-linear coupling of stellar and AGN feedback. We compare total matter power spectra between hydrodynamic and paired $N$-body simulations and demonstrate that the baryonic spread metric broadly captures the global impact of feedback on matter clustering over variations of cosmological and astrophysical parameters, initial conditions, and galaxy formation models. Using symbolic regression, we find a function that reproduces the suppression of power by feedback as a function of wave number ($k$) and baryonic spread up to $k \sim 10\,h$\,Mpc$^{-1}$ while highlighting the challenge of developing models robust to variations in galaxy formation physics implementation.

  Current methods of identifying the ionizing source of nebular emission in galaxies are well defined for the era of single fiber spectroscopy, but still struggle to differentiate the complex and overlapping ionization sources in some galaxies. With the advent of integral field spectroscopy, the limits of these previous classification schemes are more apparent. We propose a new method for distinguishing the ionizing source in resolved galaxy spectra by use of a multi-dimensional diagnostic diagram that compares emission line ratios with velocity dispersion on a spaxel by spaxel basis within a galaxy. This new method is tested using the SAMI Galaxy Survey Data Release 3, which contains 3068 galaxies at z $&lt;$ 0.12. Our results are released as ionization maps available alongside the SAMI DR3 public data. Our method accounts for a more diverse range of ionization sources than the standard suite of emission line diagnostics; we find 1433 galaxies with significant contribution from non-star-forming ionization using our improved method as compared to 316 galaxies identified using only emission line ratio diagnostics. Within these galaxies, we further identify 886 galaxies hosting unique signatures inconsistent with standard ionization by H2 regions, AGN, or shocks. These galaxies span a wide range of masses and morphological types and comprise a sizable portion of the galaxies used in our sample. With our revised method, we show that emission line diagnostics alone do not adequately differentiate the multiple ways to ionize gas within a galaxy.
