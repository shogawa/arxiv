  Cooling flows are observed in X-ray studies of the centres of cool core clusters, galaxy groups and individual elliptical galaxies. They are partly hidden from direct view by embedded cold gas so have been called Hidden Cooling Flows. X-ray spectra from the XMM RGS reveal emission from hot gas modified by photoelectric absorption by cold gas intrinsic to the flow. Here we present the spectral analysis of 6 more low redshift galaxy groups ranging from the nearest fossil group to 2 groups hosting bright radio sources. All reveal absorbed cooling flows. AGN feedback is ineffective in heating the inner cooling gas in groups and elliptical galaxies. We have extended the analysis to include 3 nearby spiral galaxies (the Sombrero, Whirlpool and Sculptor galaxies). They have similar absorbed soft X-ray spectra to elliptical galaxies and may also host cooling flows of 0.3 to 1.1\Msun/yr in their CircumGalactic Medium.

  We compare the excitation of the Narrow-Line Region (NLR) of type 1 and type 2 QSOs for redshifts $0.4 \le z \le 0.5$ via the analysis of their emission line properties in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) near-UV/optical spectra. We fit the continuum and emission lines, using two kinematic components for \oiii$\lambda$5007 and \hb\ (narrow and broad) and a single component for the weaker lines. We find two main differences in the NLR excitation of type 1 and 2 QSOs: (i) QSOs 2 have higher \oiii/\hb\ than QSOs 1 in both narrow and broad components; (ii) QSOs 1 present higher \nev, \neiii\ and \oiii$\lambda4363$ luminosities, higher \nev/\neiii\ and \neiii/\oii\ ratios and higher temperatures than QSOs 2. These differences support more highly excited regions, higher temperature gas and prevalence of shocks in type 1 relative to type 2 QSOs. We suggest two possible scenarios: (i) type 1 QSOs are seen more pole-on, allowing the observation of more highly excited gas closer to the nucleus, supporting the Unified Model scenario; (ii) evolution from type 2 to type 1 QSOs, with highest excitation regions obscured in type 2's and cleared up in a ``blow-out phase". Support for the evolutionary scenario is given by the usually higher L\oiii\ in QSOs 2, in the sense that these sources host a more powerful AGN that, in its evolution, clears up the excess dust and gas to reveal a lower-luminosity but more highly excited type 1 AGN.

  Variability detected in galaxies is usually attributed to their active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the classic AGN unification model predicts that type~2 AGNs rarely vary because their engines are obstructed by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies largely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam imaging data from three surveys over $\sim$140~arcmin$^2$ in the COSMOS field, we found 117 galaxies with $\geq 4$$\sigma$ variability in the F356W band across a $\sim$2-year baseline. Cross-matching with existing JWST spectroscopic data in this area, we identified five of them at $z=0.19$--3.69, which were all coincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the last imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at $z=0.90$ using the archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic subsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two others form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be explained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause. However, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad permitted lines ($\Delta v &gt; 1000$~km~s$^{-1}$) indicative of a type~1 AGN; (2) two show narrow permitted lines consistent with type~2 AGNs, with another one likely type~2 based on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair, show no emission lines. Our results add more challenges to the unification model.

  Recent JWST surveys of high-redshift galaxies have found surprisingly large black holes, with many being measured to be $\sim100$ times more massive than local galaxies with the same stellar mass. Here, we find that a population of these black holes would have dramatic implications for our understanding of their growth across cosmic time. We first show that the global black hole mass density at $z \sim 5$ would be comparable to local values. This would not occur if these black holes occupy a small fraction of galaxies, though it would be expected if these black holes radiate at high efficiencies (requiring that the central engines of AGN spin rapidly). We then show that the individual detected $z \sim 5$ black holes would remain overmassive compared to the local relation if they grow according to the average rates of state-of-the-art models. These systems must instead grow at least an order of magnitude more slowly than expected if they are to fall within the observed scatter of the local black hole mass-stellar mass relation. Such slow growth is surprising in comparison to other estimates of the radiative efficiency of AGN, especially because growth must be rapid at $z &gt; 5$ in order to build up such massive black holes quickly. Finally, we highlight the challenges that overmassive black holes have on our understanding of the impact of quasar feedback on galaxies.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a new population of objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe ($z\gtrsim3$). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.
