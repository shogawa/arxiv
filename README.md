  We use JWST/MIRI MRS spectroscopy of a sample of six local obscured type 1.9/2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) to compare their nuclear mid-IR absorption bands with the level of nuclear obscuration traced by X-rays. This study is the first to use sub-arcsecond angular resolution data of local obscured AGN to investigate the nuclear mid-IR absorption bands with a wide wavelength coverage (4.9-28.1 $\mu$m). All the nuclei show the 9.7 $\mu$m silicate band in absorption. We compare the strength of the 9.7 and 18 $\mu$m silicate features with torus model predictions. The observed silicate features are generally well explained by clumpy and smooth torus models. We report the detection of the 6 $\mu$m dirty water ice band (i.e., a mix of water and other molecules such as CO and CO$_2$) at sub-arcsecond scales ($\sim$0.26" at 6 $\mu$m; inner $\sim$50 pc) in a sample of local AGN with different levels of nuclear obscuration ranging from log N$_{\rm H}^{\rm X-Ray}$(cm$^{-2}$)$\sim22-25$. There is a good correlation between the 6 $\mu$m water ice optical depths and N$_{\rm H}^{\rm X-Ray}$. This result indicates that the water ice absorption might be a reliable tracer of the nuclear intrinsic obscuration in AGN. The weak water ice absorption in less obscured AGN (log N$_H^{X-ray}$ (cm$^{-2}$)$\lesssim$23.0 cm$^{-2}$) might be related to the hotter dust temperature ($&gt;$T$_{sub}^{H_2O}\sim$110 K) expected to be reached in the outer layers of the torus due to their more inhomogeneous medium. Our results highlight the need to include the molecular content, such as, H$_2$O, aliphatic hydrocarbons (CH-) and more complex PAH molecules in torus models to better constrain key parameters such as the nuclear structure covering factor (i.e. nuclear obscuration)

  Masers are a unique tool to investigate the emitting gas in the innermost regions of AGNs and to map accretion disks and tori orbiting around supermassive black holes. IC485, which is classified as a LINER or Seyfert galaxy, hosts a bright water maser whose nature is still under debate. Indeed, this might be either a nuclear disk maser, a jet/outflow maser, or even the very first `inclined water maser disk'. We aim to investigate the nature of the maser by determining the location and the distribution of the maser emission at mas resolution and by associating it with the main nuclear components of IC485. In a broader context, this work might also provide further information for better understanding the physics and the disk/jet geometry in LINER or Seyfert galaxies. We observed in 2018 the nuclear region of IC485 in continuum and spectral-line mode with the VLBA and the EVN at L, C, and K bands (linear scales from ~3 to 0.2 pc). We detected 2 water maser components separated in velocity by 472 km/s, with one centred at the systemic velocity of the nuclear region and the other at a red-shifted velocity. We measured for the first time the absolute positions of these components with an accuracy of ~0.1 mas. Assuming a maser associated with an edge-on disk in Keplerian rotation, the estimated enclosed mass is M_BH = 1.2 x 10^7 M_sun, consistent with the expected mass for a SMBH in a LINER or Seyfert galaxy. The linear distribution of the maser components and a comparison with the high sensitivity GBT spectrum strongly suggest that the bulk of the maser emission is associated with an edge-on accretion disk. This makes IC485 a new candidate for a disk-maser galaxy at the distance of 122 Mpc. In particular, thanks to the upcoming radio facilities (e.g., the SKA and the ngVLA) IC485 will play an important role in our understanding of AGNs in an unexplored volume of Universe.

  The sampling strategy of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) make TESS light curves extremely valuable to investigate high cadence optical variability of AGN. However, because the TESS instrument was primarily designed for exoplanet science, the use of the satellite for other applications requires careful treatment of the data. In this paper we introduce Quaver, a new software tool designed specifically to extract TESS light curves of extended and faint sources presenting stochastic variability. We then use this new tool to extract light curves of the nearby radio-loud AGN Pictor A, and perform a temporal and power spectral analysis of its high cadence optical variability. The obtained light curves are well fit with a damped random walk (DRW) model, exhibiting both stochastic AGN variations and flaring behavior. The DRW characteristic timescales $\tau_{\rm DRW} \sim 3-6$ days during more quiet periods, and $\tau_{\rm DRW} \sim 0.8$ days for periods with strong flares, even when the flares themselves are masked from the DRW fit. The observed timescales are consistent with the dynamical, orbital and thermal timescales expected for the low black hole mass of Pictor A.
