  In the last few years, a few supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have shown short-term (of the order of hours) X-ray variability. Given the limited size of the sample, every new addition to this class of SMBHs can bring invaluable information. Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on typical timescales of $\simeq20-25$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs ($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However, given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.

  One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z &gt; 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z~6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z analogs of LRDs, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4332, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 Msun yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 Msun, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.

  We present results from uGMRT 685 MHz observations of 87 QSOs belonging to the Palomar Green (PG) quasar sample with $z&lt;0.5$. Radio emission is detected in all sources except for 3 radio-quiet (RQ) sources, viz., PG 0043+039, PG 1121+422, and PG 1552+085. The radio-loud (RL) $-$ RQ dichotomy persists at 685 MHz with only 1 source, PG 1216+069, changing its classification from RQ to RL. Approximately 1/3 of the detected RQ quasars display AGN-dominated radio emission while the rest may show additional contributions from stellar-related processes. Consistent with this, the RL and RQ quasars occupy distinct tracks on the `fundamental plane' of black hole activity. We find that RL quasars have $\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1}) &gt; 25.5$, while RQ quasars have ${\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1})} &lt;23.5$. Furthermore, the radio sizes display the RQ$-$RL divide as well with RQ sources typically having sizes $\lesssim30$ kpc, with only 16 ($\sim22$%) RQ sources having sizes between 30 and 100 kpc where there is an overlap with RL quasar sizes. A strong correlation exists between 685 MHz radio luminosity and black hole mass which is tightened when accretion rate is considered, highlighting the important role played by the accretion rate and accretion disk structure in jet production. We found no difference in the minimum-energy magnetic field strengths of the radio cores of RL and RQ quasars; however, different assumptions of source volume and volume filling factors may apply. High-resolution X-ray observations and radio-X-ray flux comparisons are needed to independently test the `magnetic flux paradigm'.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN), star formation (SF), and galaxy interactions can drive turbulence in the gas of the ISM, which in turn plays a role in the SF within galaxies. The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as it serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of turbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and intermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF galaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54 galaxies at z&lt;0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853, [FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from W80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line ratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin of the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the largest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less turbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity dispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the nucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5--1 kpc, followed by an outward increase up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display increasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line ratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most turbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We speculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and jet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be created by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an important mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from cooling and forming new stars.

  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that were originally classified as sources with little to no radio emission. Although the class is rather unified from an optical perspective, their radio characteristics are diverse. One of the biggest curiosities found in these sources is their ability to form and maintain powerful relativistic jets. We studied the radio properties of a sample of 3998 NLS1 galaxies which is the largest clean sample available, thus allowing us to study the population-wide characteristics. We used both historical and ongoing surveys: the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS; 144~MHz), the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST; 1.4~GHz), the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS; 1.4~GHz), and the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; 3~GHz). We were able to obtain a radio detection for $\sim40\%$ of our sources, with the most detections by LoTSS. The majority of the detected NLS1 galaxies are faint ($\sim1-2$ mJy) and non-variable, suggesting considerable contributions from star formation activities, especially at 144~MHz. However, we identified samples of extreme sources, for example, in fractional variability and radio luminosity, indicating significant AGN activity. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the NLS1 galaxy population in radio and lays the foundation for targeted future studies.
