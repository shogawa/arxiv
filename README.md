The recent IceCube detection of TeV neutrinos from some nearby Seyfert galaxy (e.g., NGC~1068) suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) could make a significant contribution to the diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos. The absence of TeV gamma-rays from NGC~1068 indicates neutrino production in compact gamma-ray-opaque region. The vicinity of the supermassive black hole, such as disk-corona, is an ideal region, where the high radiation density leads to efficient neutrino production as well as the gamma-ray attenuation. Disk-corona models predict that the neutrino emission from AGNs correlates with X-ray emission, which traces the coronal activity. In this paper, we assess whether the X-ray AGN population origin for TeV neutrinos can be tested by using the spatial correlation between the neutrino population and X-ray AGN population with future neutrino telescopes. By performing simulations, we find that, the AGN origin of the neutrino background above 100\,TeV can be tested at a confidence level of $\sim2.4σ$ with five-year observations of IceCube-Gen2, which has an angular resolution of $\sim0.2$ degree. With better angular resolution and sensitivity in the energy range of above $300$\,TeV, a 30-${\rm km^3}$ underwater neutrino telescope, such as High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT), is expected to reach a significance of $\sim8.6σ$ in testing the association after five years of exposure.

Galaxy mergers are expected to have a profound influence on the star formation histories of galaxies. It is generally expected that mergers are the main drivers of galaxy mass growth through the accretion of mass and the triggering of new star formation episodes, while the shocks and torques induced by the merger may drive gas and dust to central supermassive black holes and fuel active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and producing both positive and negative feedback. We test whether a merger-AGN-star formation connection exists by selecting samples of galaxy pairs of stellar masses log(M/Msun) approximately 10.2 and 11.4 within the redshift of 0.25 at various projected separation and velocity differences in an increasing order, and therefore having a decreasing probability of being truly bound and interacting. We identify galaxies in close pairs and then measure their star formation rates (SFRs) (via their NUV - r colours) and the degree of AGN activity (from X-rays, radio emission at 20cm, WISE infrared colours, and emission line ratios) as a function of their projected separation and velocity difference. We find only weak evidence that galaxies in pairs have higher SFRs as galaxies become closer in projected and velocity separation, except possibly for pairs at closest separation of less than 20 kpc and velocity difference less than 500 km/s. Similarly, we see no strong evidence that AGN are more common for galaxies in closer pairs, irrespective of the method used to detect AGN. For this sample, we do not find any clear evidence that mergers and interactions may play a significant role in triggering star formation and AGN activity, opposite to expectations from theoretical models invoking feedback episodes. Secular processes may be more important, although this may depend on the selection of galaxies and indicators for star formation and AGN activity.

We present a spatially-resolved analysis of galaxy quenching within the Spiderweb Protocluster at $z \sim 2.16$, combining deep imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Utilizing pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution fitting, we derive maps of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and rest-frame UVJ colors. Quiescent galaxies, predominantly found at $\log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 10.5$, exhibit clear mass-dependent inside-out quenching, with central sSFR approximately an order of magnitude lower than outer regions, while lower-mass star-forming galaxies show flat sSFR profiles. Central star formation activity fundamentally anti-correlates with Sérsic index, indicating reduced activity in bulge-dominated systems. Spatially resolved UVJ colors reveal heterogeneous internal star formation, distinguishing star-forming regions in quiescent hosts from those in globally star-forming systems. These findings demonstrate that quenching mechanisms were effectively operating by $z \sim 2$, with the observed inside-out patterns and morphological correlations consistent with AGN-driven feedback processes. Our study provides key observational constraints on galaxy evolution during this critical epoch.

Variability studies of jetted AGN, in particular blazars, have been used to gain a better understanding of the particle acceleration mechanisms in jets. However, statistical methods used for the characterization of variability often rely on stationary time series data, which is not fulfilled for most blazar light curves. We introduce the recurrence plot method for long-term $γ$-ray light curves sampled by Fermi-LAT and present our results for the BL Lac object Mkn 421 and the FSRQ PKS 1424-41. Using surrogates to determine the significance of our findings, we conclude that Mkn 421 exhibits more determinism than PKS 1424-41, and that both sources potentially show nonlinearity. However, the latter has to be tested against more advanced surrogates that are able to replicate the nonstationarity of the original light curves. In future work, we will extend our recurrence analysis to a sample of $\sim50$ $γ$-ray bright sources to probe the jet dynamics of different blazar classes.

We propose a large quasar demographic optical multi-object spectroscopic (MOS) survey targeting over 50 million AGN candidates up to the highest redshifts possible in the optical (z~6.5), with repeat visits, using a variety of selection criteria available by 2040. A large MOS survey combining all AGN selection methods is the only way to unify a diverse range of different obscured AGN populations within a single, variability- and spectroscopy-based framework, rather than as disjoint classes selected by different methods.

Accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powers active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and drives feedback that shapes galaxy evolution. Constraining AGN accretion disk structure is therefore essential for understanding black hole growth and feedback processes. However, direct constraints on disk size remain rare -- particularly from long-term, multi-season spectroscopic reverberation mapping (RM), which is critical for isolating the intrinsic disk response from the broad-line region (BLR). We present results from an intensive multi-wavelength RM campaign of NGC 4151 during its brightest state in nearly two decades. This represents the third high-cadence monitoring over the past decade, capturing accretion states spanning the transitional regime between thin and thick disks, making NGC 4151 the only AGN with continuum RM observations across such a wide range in accretion states. Combining spectroscopy from the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope with coordinated Swift UV/X-ray monitoring, we measure inter-band continuum lags from UV to optical. The wavelength-dependent lags follow a tight $τ\propto λ^{4/3}$ relation, consistent with reprocessing in a thin disk, but exceed theoretical predictions by a factor of 6.6. Our lag spectrum reveals clear excesses near the Balmer and possibly Paschen jumps, confirming diffuse continuum (DC) contamination from the BLR. By comparing the three campaigns, we discover a non-monotonic lag-luminosity trend ($&gt;3σ$), which cannot be explained by DC emission alone. We propose the lags reflect combined disk and BLR contributions, and present the first evidence that the DC component follows an intrinsic Baldwin effect. These results offer new insights into SMBH mass measurements and theoretical models of AGN inner structure.

Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are a new class of extragalactic object, with large rings of faint radio continuum emission typically spanning 100s of kpc; their origins are unknown. Previous optical spectroscopy of the central galaxy in ORC4, a classic isolated ORC, revealed spatially-extended ionized gas with strong [OII] emission and line ratios consistent with LINER emission. We present new Keck/KCWI+KCRM integral field spectroscopy covering multiple strong optical emission lines to measure the extent, morphology, and spatially-resolved kinematics and line ratios of the ionized and neutral gas in the ORC4 central galaxy. We find that [OII] is the strongest optical emission line in this massive, old galaxy, and the [OII] emission is more spatially extended than other optical lines, including H-alpha. The gas kinematics show strong spatial asymmetries, high velocity gradients (&gt;100 km/s), and high velocity dispersion (~200 km/s). The emission line ratios are most consistent with shock models with shock velocities of ~200-300 km/s and are not fit well by AGN photoionization models. These findings strongly suggest that the gas in the ORC4 central galaxy is the result of shock ionization in and around the central galaxy, likely associated with the event that created the large-scale radio ring of emission that identified this source as an ORC.

We present a comprehensive kinematic and ionization analysis of the warm ionized filaments ($10^4$ K) in M87, the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, using new integral field spectroscopy from MEGARA (GTC) and SITELLE (CFHT). MEGARA targets the southeastern (SE) filaments (3 kpc from the nucleus), coincident with the only known molecular gas clump, and the far eastern (FE) filament (15 kpc), spatially isolated within an old radio lobe. SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$α$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases. However, the FE filament deviates from this trend, possibly due to uplift from past AGN outbursts or limitations in the analysis method.
