  Occupying the intermediate-mass regime of the accretion--jet parameter space, radio continuum emission from active galactic nuclei with black hole mass M_BH &lt;~ 10^6 Msun (low-mass AGNs) is a valuable probe to the physics of relativistic jets. Yet the number of low-mass AGNs with radio detection is rather limited so far (~ 40 in total). In this work we make two efforts to search for radio counterparts for the largest sample of optically selected low-mass AGNs. First, we collect counterparts from the recent data releases of SKA pathfinders such as LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). Additionally, we deeply mine in Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST), fitting the FIRST images of the optical AGNs with an elaborate procedure optimized to detect faint radio sources. We have obtained 151 radio sources (mainly from the SKA pathfinders), including 102 new reliable sources (S/N &gt;= 5) and 23 new candidates (3.5 &lt;= S/N &lt; 5). The majority of these new sources (119 of 125) have flux densities lower than the threshold of the official FIRST catalog. The new sources have rest-frame 20 cm power (P_20cm) from 1.98 x 10^20 to 1.29 x 10^23 W/Hz. For low-z Seyfert galaxies P_20cm correlates with M_BH intrinsically and positively, yet only marginally with Eddington ratio L/L_EDD. In terms of the logN--logS relation for the expanding Universe, the limiting flux density for the completeness of our LoTSS sources turns out to be 0.45 mJy at 1.4 GHz; i.e., complete to such a flux-density level that is four times deeper than the official FIRST catalog.

  The finding of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies has important implications for galaxy evolution and supermassive black hole formation models. Yet, how AGN in dwarf galaxies form is still debated, in part due to scant demographics. We make use of the MaNGA survey, comprising $\sim$10,000 galaxies at z $&lt;$ 0.15, to identify AGN dwarf galaxies using a spaxel by spaxel classification in three spatially-resolved emission line diagnostic diagrams (the [NII-, [SII]- and [OI]-BPT) and the WHAN diagram. This yields a sample of 664 AGN dwarf galaxies, the largest to date, and an AGN fraction of $\sim20\%$ that is significantly larger than that of single-fiber-spectroscopy studies (i.e. $\sim1\%$). This can be explained by the lower bolometric luminosity ($&lt; 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and accretion rate (sub-Eddington) of the MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies. We additionally identify 1,176 SF-AGN (classified as star-forming in the [NII]-BPT but as AGN in the [SII]- and [OI]-BPT), 122 Composite, and 173 LINER sources. The offset between the optical center of the galaxy and the median position of the AGN spaxels is more than 3 arcsec for $\sim$62\% of the AGN, suggesting that some could be off-nuclear. We also identify seven new broad-line AGN with log $M_\mathrm{BH}$ = 5.0 - 5.9 $M_\mathrm{\odot}$. Our results show how integral-field spectroscopy is a powerful tool for uncovering faint and low-accretion AGN and better constraining the demographics of AGN in dwarf galaxies.
