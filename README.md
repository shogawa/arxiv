  High redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide key insights into early supermassive black hole growth and cosmic evolution. This study investigates the parsec-scale properties of 86 radio-loud quasars at z $\geq$ 3 using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. Our results show predominantly compact core and core-jet morphologies, with 35\% unresolved cores, 59\% core-jet structures, and only 6\% core-double jet morphology. Brightness temperatures are generally lower than expected for highly radiative sources. The jet proper motions are surprisingly slow compared to lower-redshift samples. We observe a high fraction of young and/or confined peak-spectrum sources, providing insights into early AGN evolution in dense environments during early cosmic epochs. The observed trends may reflect genuine evolutionary changes in AGN structure over cosmic time, or selection effects favoring more compact sources at higher redshifts. These results stress the complexity of high-redshift radio-loud AGN populations and emphasize the need for multi-wavelength, high-resolution observations to fully characterize their properties and evolution through cosmic history.

  Double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) might be evidence for the existence of kpc-scale dual AGNs. There are so far large samples of objects with DPNELs in narrow emission line galaxies. Here, a systematic search is made to build a sample of type 1 AGNs with double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] from Data Release 16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Through visually inspecting and fitting [O~{\sc~iii}], fitting broad H$\alpha$ emission lines, performing F-test for [O~{\sc~iii}] profiles, and checking broad H$\beta$ and [O~{\sc~iii}] emission lines, we select 62 type 1 AGNs with reliable double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] from 11557 QSOs with z &lt; 0.3. After visually checking the 62 SDSS multi-color images, we find only seven objects with signs of merging. Four possible models for the double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] observed in our sample are discussed: the superposition model, AGN outflow model, dual AGN model, and rotating disk model. However, the current results can not provide any one explanation conclusively, and additional observational data are needed to provide the details of narrow line regions. But at least 22 objects with different velocity offsets between double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] and narrow H$\alpha$ emission lines could be excluded as dual AGN candidates. The relative velocity offsets of the [O~{\sc~iii}] blue-shifted/red-shifted components are negative to their line flux ratios, which is consistent with dual AGN model. This work provides a new sample of 62 type 1 AGNs with double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] for further study.

  In the case of Type-2 AGNs, estimating the mass of the black hole is challenging. Understanding how galaxies form and evolve requires considerable insight into the mass of black holes. This work compared different classical and quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms for black hole mass estimation, wherein the classical algorithms are Linear Regression, XGBoost Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Bayesian Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Booster Regressor, Classical Neural Networks, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), LSTM, Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) and Transformer-Based Regression. On the other hand, quantum algorithms including Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (Q-LSTM), Sampler-QNN, Estimator-QNN, Variational Quantum Regressor (VQR), Quantum Linear Regression(Q-LR), QML with JAX optimization were also tested. The results revealed that classical algorithms gave better R^2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE results than the quantum models. Among the classical models, LSTM has the best result with an accuracy of 99.77%. Estimator-QNN has the highest accuracy for quantum algorithms with an MSE of 0.0124 and an accuracy of 99.75%. This study ascertains both the strengths and weaknesses of the classical and the quantum approaches. As far as our knowledge goes, this work could pave the way for the future application of quantum algorithms in astrophysical data analysis.

  We report a statistically significant detection of cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission from a stacked sample of SPT-SZ selected galaxy clusters using 16.4 years of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope's Large Area Telescope (LAT). By analyzing a population of clusters with individual Test Statistic (TS) values $&lt;$ 9.0, we identify a robust cumulative signal with a TS of 75.2, corresponding to approximately 8.4$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, clusters with TS $&lt;$ 4.0 yield a weaker cumulative signal of TS = 9.65, consistent with background fluctuations. The derived $\gamma$-ray spectrum is well characterized by a power law model with a best-fit spectral index of $-2.59 \pm 0.20$ and an integrated flux of $1.67^{+1.35}_{-1.07} \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The spectral index matches hadronic cosmic-ray interaction predictions but may also include contributions from AGNs within the galaxy clusters.

  Coronal lines (CLs), which arise from collisionally excited forbidden transitions from highly ionized species, are a powerful diagnostic tool in uncovering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and constraining their properties. However, recent optical surveys are finding that coronal lines are rarely detected in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a result of the depletion of elements from the interstellar gas onto dust grains. Prominent CL emission may therefore only arise when dust is being destroyed in the highly ionized gas in AGNs. To explore the possibility that dust destruction may be caused by ionized gas outflows in galaxies with prominent CLs, we present the first large-scale systematic study of ionized outflows, as traced by the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission, in galaxies displaying CL emission relative to a robust control sample of non-CL-emitting galaxies. We find: 1) galaxies that display CL emission have a significantly elevated outflow incidence rate compared to their matched controls, 2) the outflow luminosity is significantly higher in the CL-emitters, 3) the CL-emitters have systematically lower intrinsic extinction toward the ionized gas compared with the controls, 4) there are significant correlations between the CL luminosity and outflow velocity for the iron CLs, with similar relationships found between the CL FWHM and outflow luminosity. These observations are consistent with dust destruction in an outflowing wind from a dusty torus causing efficient CL emission.

  Accurate modeling of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, especially due to relativistic jets, is crucial for understanding the cool-core problem in galaxy clusters. We present a new subgrid method to model accretion onto and feedback from AGN in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. Instead of applying the traditional Bondi formalism, we use a sink particle algorithm in which the accretion flux is measured directly through a control surface. A weighting kernel is used to reset the gas properties within the accretion radius at the end of each timestep. We implement feedback in the form of bipolar jets whose properties are tied to the accretion rate. The method is tested with a spherically symmetric Bondi gas flow problem and a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton wind problem, with and without jet feedback. We discuss the reliability of this model by comparing our jet simulations with those in the literature, and we examine the dependence of test results on parameters such as the resolution and size of the jet injection region. We find that the sink particle model can account for the $\alpha$ factor in accretion measurement, and the accretion radius must be resolved with at least two zones to produce realistic black hole accretion. We also show how under-resolving the AGN feedback region in simulations can impact the feedback energy deposited and the jet dynamics. The code described here is the framework for a feedback model, described in a companion paper, that will use accretion disk modeling to more self-consistently determine the feedback efficiency.

  We investigate close encounters between initially unbound black holes (BHs) in the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN), performing the first 3D non-isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of gas-assisted binary BH formation. We discuss a suite of 135 simulations, considering 9 AGN disc environments and 15 BH impact parameters. We find that the gas distribution within the Hill sphere about an isolated embedded BH is akin to a spherically symmetric star with a low-mass convective envelope and a BH core, with large convective currents driving strong outflows away from the midplane. We find that Coriolis force acting on the outflow results in winds, analogous to cyclones, that counter-rotate with respect to the midplane flow within the Hill sphere. We confirm the existence of strong thermal blasts due to minidisc collisions during BH close encounters, as predicted in our previous 2D studies. We document binary formation across a wide range of environments, finding formation likelihood is increased when the gas mass in the Hill sphere is large, allowing for easier binary formation in the outer AGN disc. We provide a comprehensive overview of the SMBH's role in binary formation, investigating how binary formation in intermediate density environments is biased towards certain binary orientations. We offer two models for predicting dissipation by gas during close encounters, as a function of the ambient Hill mass alone, or with the periapsis depth. We use these models to motivate a prescription for binary formation likelihood that can be readily applied to Monte-Carlo simulations of AGN evolution.
