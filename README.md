  We used a supervised machine learning algorithm (probabilistic random forest) to classify ~130 million sources in the VISTA Survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC). We used multi-wavelength photometry from optical to far-infrared as features to be trained on, and spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), galaxies and a range of stellar classes including from new observations with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and SAAO 1.9m telescope. We also retain a label for sources that remain unknown. This yielded average classifier accuracies of ~79% (SMC) and ~87% (LMC). Restricting to the 56,696,719 sources with class probabilities (P$_{class}$) &gt; 80% yields accuracies of ~90% (SMC) and ~98% (LMC). After removing sources classed as 'Unknown', we classify a total of 707,939 (SMC) and 397,899 (LMC) sources, including &gt; 77,600 extragalactic sources behind the Magellanic Clouds. The extragalactic sources are distributed evenly across the field, whereas the Magellanic sources concentrate at the centres of the Clouds, and both concentrate in optical/IR colour-colour/magnitude diagrams as expected. We also test these classifications using independent datasets, finding that, as expected, the majority of X-ray sources are classified as AGN (554/883) and the majority of radio sources are classed as AGN (1756/2694) or galaxies (659/2694), where the relative AGN-galaxy proportions vary substantially with radio flux density. We have found: &gt; 49,500 hitherto unknown AGN candidates, likely including more AGN dust dominated sources which are in a critical phase of their evolution; &gt; 26,500 new galaxy candidates and &gt; 2800 new Young Stellar Object (YSO) candidates.

  We present radio polarimetric images of 12 Seyfert and Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region (LINER) galaxies belonging to the Centre for Astrophysics (CfA)+12 micron sample exhibiting kiloparsec-scale radio outflows (KSRs). These observations have been carried out at 10 GHz with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in D-array and at 1.4 GHz with the BnA$\rightarrow$A array configurations. We find signatures of organized magnetic (B-) field structures in the cores, jets and lobes of these galaxies. The linear polarization fraction varies from a few per cent in the cores to $47\pm18$ per cent in the lobes. The inferred B-fields are toroidal in the cores of several sources making them consistent with the presence of either a sheath-like or a wind-like component surrounding the jet. The in-band spectral index images typically show the presence of flat/inverted spectrum cores and steep spectrum lobes. Radio cores with flatter spectra are found to have lower Eddington ratios while the steeper ones have higher. A strong correlation is observed between the Seyfert/LINER radio outflow properties and the mass of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs); correlations with Eddington ratios are weaker. We find signatures of jet-medium interaction and both positive and negative AGN feedback in these sources. Overall, our study indicates that radio-quiet (RQ) AGN with KSRs possess radio outflows driven by magnetic fields anchored to their black holes - accretion disks, which significantly impact their environments.

  We search for reflection-dominated Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT AGN) candidates in the Lockman Hole region using the data of SRG/eROSITA Lockman Hole survey. We selected sources with anomalously hard photon indices in the $0.3 - 8.0$ keV band, untypical for type I AGN. In particular, we required that the upper end of the $90\%$ error interval did not exceed a fiducial boundary of $\Gamma=1.3$. We found 291 sources which constitute a rare subpopulation among extragalactic X-ray sources detected by eROSITA in the Lockman Hole field, $\approx 5\%$. These sources constitute the eROSITA sample of CT AGN candidates in the Lockman Hole field. We further divide the sources into three categories depending on the availability of reliable redshift and statistically significant detection of intrinsic absorption. We present two catalogues: the bright sample (37 sources) and the faint one (254). We estimate the fraction and sky density of reflection-dominated CT AGN candidates. We show examples of individual spectra and use stacking analysis to search for possible redshift evolution of their properties with redshift. We analyse combined eROSITA spectra of bright sources of different categories with a physically motivated spectral model UXCLUMPY and find them fully consistent with the fits to the about $\sim 1$ Msec XMM-Newton data for one of our reflection-dominated CT candidates, Type 2 galaxy $\text{SRGe J105348.6+573032}$. The catalogues of CT AGN candidates could be a good starting point for planning future studies and follow-ups at all wavelengths.

  Whether the mass of supermassive black hole ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) is directly linked to the quasar radio luminosity remains a long-debated issue, and understanding the role of $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in the evolution of quasars is pivotal to unveiling the mechanism of AGN feedback. In this work, based on a two-component Bayesian model, we examine how $M_\mathrm{BH}$ affects the radio emission from quasars, separating the contributions from host galaxy star formation (SF) and AGN activity. By modelling the radio flux density distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2, we find no correlation between $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and SF rate (SFR) at any mass for quasars at a given redshift and bolometric luminosity. The same holds for AGN activity across most $M_\mathrm{BH}$ values; however, quasars with the top 20\% most massive SMBHs are 2 to 3 times more likely to host strong radio jets than those with lower-mass SMBHs at similar redshift and luminosity. We suggest defining radio quasar populations by their AGN and SF contributions instead of radio loudness; our new definition unifies previously divergent observational results on the role of $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in quasar radio emissions. We further demonstrate that this radio enhancement in quasars with the 20\% most massive SMBHs affects only the $\sim5\%$ most radio bright quasars at a given redshift and bolometric luminosity. We discuss possible physical origins of this radio excess in the most massive and radio-bright quasar population, which remains an interest for future study.

  Observations suggest an SMBH-host coevolution. We consider the mass and energy flow in a bulge suffused by gases of varying temperatures. By assuming the rate of energy flow independent of the distance from the bulge center and the local virial equilibrium for permeated gases, a key parameter $\varepsilon_b$ was identified that quantifies the rate of mass and energy flow in gases and the efficiency of gas cooling and thus regulates the coevolution of SMBHs and hosts. Using Illustris simulations, we found $\varepsilon_b\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$. A higher $\varepsilon_b$ in the early Universe means a more efficient gas cooling that allows initial rapid growth of SMBHs and hosts. This simple theory, characterized by $\varepsilon_b$, provides the dominant mean cosmic evolution of SMBHs and hosts. All other transient phenomena may only contribute to the dispersion around mean evolution. Relevant scaling laws involving $\varepsilon_b$ were identified. For host galaxies, the mass-size relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{2/3}r_b^{5/3}G^{-1}$, dispersion-size relation $\sigma_b^2\propto(\varepsilon_b r_b)^{2/3}\propto (1+z)$, or the mass-dispersion relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{-1}G^{-1}\sigma_b^5$ were identified, where size $r_b\propto (1+z)^{-1}$. For SMBHs, three evolution phases were found involving an initial rapid growth stage with a rising luminosity $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/5}$, a transition stage with a declining $L_B\propto \varepsilon_b^2 M_{BH} \propto (1+z)^5$, and a dormant stage with $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/3}$. Results suggest a rapid initial super-Eddington growth with a new redshift-dependent luminosity limit $L_X\propto\varepsilon_b^{4/5}M_{BH}^{4/5}G^{-1/5}c$, in contrast to the Eddington limit. Analytical solutions are formulated for the BH and AGN mass functions and AGN duty cycle and predict a slope of -1/5 for the faint-end luminosity function.
