  We propose an alternative physical interpretation and formation pathway for the recently discovered "little red dots" (LRDs). We model LRDs as super-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self-gravitating accretion discs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The model provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where the V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line broadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN, stellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required. This results in a model with uniquely few, physically motivated free parameters that are robust to variations in observed LRD properties. We perform MCMC fits for two representative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior distributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius relation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion in self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that squarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation. In addition, the model implies a redshift distribution for LRDs that accurately matches with observations.

  Axion-like particles (ALPs) provide a compelling avenue for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In astrophysical magnetized plasmas an ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ induces energy-dependent oscillations in the photon survival probability that imprint modulations on emission spectra. X-ray observations of bright spectrally-smooth sources can provide particularly sensitive probes of ultralight ALPs with masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV due to long propagation distances, strong magnetic fields and high photon statistics. We present a comprehensive forecast of ALP-photon conversion in three representative systems: (i) background active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through foreground intracluster magnetic fields, (ii) central AGNs within their host cluster halos and (iii) Galactic X-ray binaries viewed through the Milky Way field. Using detailed simulations we assess the prospective sensitivity of high-resolution X-ray missions including XRISM, Athena, and Arcus. For typical magnetic field configurations a 5 Ms XRISM observation of the Perseus Cluster AGN NGC 1275 can reach down to $g_{a\gamma} \sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $m_a \lesssim 10^{-12}$ eV, while Athena's superior energy resolution improves this reach by a factor of $\sim 3$. We quantify the impact of magnetic field modeling, photon statistics, and spectral binning strategies. Our results demonstrate the scientific potential of high-resolution X-ray observations to probe photon-ALP coupling in previously inaccessible parameter space, offering a powerful window into physics beyond the Standard Model.

  Accretion disks in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are predicted to become gravitationally unstable substantially interior to the black hole's sphere of influence, at radii where the disk is simultaneously unstable to the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Using local shearing box simulations with net vertical flux and a simple cooling prescription, we investigate the effect of magnetic fields on fragmentation in the limit of ideal magnetohydrodyamics. Different levels of in-disk magnetic field from the magnetorotational instability are generated by varying the initial vertical-field plasma beta $\beta_0$. We find that the disk becomes magnetically dominated when $\beta_0 &lt; 10^3$, and that this transition is accompanied by a drastic drop in fragmentation (as measured by the bound mass fraction) and gravitational stress. The destabilizing influence of radial magnetic fields, which are present locally and which may promote fragmentation via magnetic tension effects, is overwhelmed by magnetic elevation, which significantly reduces the mid-plane density. The magnetic suppression of fragmentation in magnetically elevated disks has implications for the radial extent of the accretion flow in AGN disks, and for the efficiency of in situ formation of disk-embedded stars that are progenitors for single and binary compact objects.

  Outflows and jets launched from the nuclei of galaxies emit radio synchrotron emission that can be used to study the impact of accretion energy on the host galaxy. The decades-long baseline now enabled by large radio surveys allows us to identify cases where new outflows or jets have been launched. Here, we present the results of a targeted VLA program observing four post-starburst galaxies that have brightened significantly in radio emission over the past ~20 years. We obtain quasi-simultaneous observations in five bands (1-18 GHz) for each source. We find peaked spectral energy distributions, indicative of self-absorbed synchrotron emission. While all four sources have risen significantly over the past ~20 years in the 1-2 GHz band, two also show clear recent flares in the 2-4 GHz band. These sources are less luminous than typical peaked spectrum radio AGN. It remains unclear whether these sources are low luminosity analogs of the peaked radio AGN from accreted gas, or driven by tidal disruption events with missed optical flares. Regardless of the source of the accreted material, these newly-launched outflows contain sufficient energy to drive the molecular gas outflows observed in post-starburst galaxies and to drive turbulence suppressing star formation.

  We present and discuss optical emission line properties obtained from the analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra for an X-ray selected sample of 3684 galaxies (0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.55), drawn from the eRASS1 catalog. We modeled SDSS-V DR19 spectra using the NBursts full spectrum fitting technique with E-MILES simple stellar populations (SSP) models and emission line templates to decompose broad and narrow emission line components for correlation with X-ray properties. We place the galaxies on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram to diagnose their dominant excitation mechanism. We show that the consistent use of the narrow component fluxes shifts most galaxies systematically and significantly upward to the active galactic nuclei (AGN) region on the BPT diagram. On this basis, we confirm the dependence between a galaxys position on the BPT diagram and its (0.2-2.3 keV) X-ray/H$\alpha$ flux ratio. We also verified the correlation between X-ray luminosity and emission line luminosities of the narrow [O\iii]$\lambda 5007$ and broad H$\alpha$ component; as well as the relations between the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) mass, the X-ray luminosity, and the velocity dispersion of the stellar component ($\sigma_{*}$) on the base on the unique sample of optical spectroscopic follow-up of X-ray sources detected by eROSITA. These results highlight the importance of emission line decomposition in AGN classification and refine the connection between X-ray emission and optical emission line properties in galaxies.

  The active suppression of star formation in galaxies is critical in preventing the growth of overly massive systems and explaining the formation of present-day elliptical galaxies. We present a high-resolution, spatially-resolved multiwavelength study of two z ~ 0.7 massive post-starburst galaxies, SDSS J1448+1010 and SDSS J2258+2313, from the SQuIGGLE survey (Studying Quenching in Intermediate-z Galaxies: Gas, anguLar momentum, and Evolution), providing new insights into the role of mergers in driving quenching. ALMA CO(2-1) observations show that both galaxies removed ~50% of their molecular gas into extended tidal tails, spanning up to 65 kpc, following recent mergers. HST WFC3 imaging and grism spectroscopy show that while SDSS J1448+1010 exhibits Halpha emission in its northern tidal tail consistent with ongoing star formation, SDSS J2258+2313 lacks detectable star-forming activity outside the central galaxy. VLA 6 GHz continuum data reveal compact radio emission in SDSS J2258+2313, while SDSS J1448+1010 hosts small radio jets indicative of AGN activity. Both galaxies retain substantial molecular gas reservoirs in their central regions that appear more turbulent than 'normal' star-forming galaxies, likely contributing to the observed low star formation rates in the hosts. Despite similarities in their cold gas content and tidal features the galaxies are distinct from each other in their star formation, gas-star alignment, and radio morphology, highlighting the complexity of tidal gas removal as a quenching mechanism at intermediate redshifts.

  Recent advancements in high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) have significantly improved our understanding of jet collimation near supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), particularly in high-power systems. However, the collimation properties of jets in low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) remain poorly explored. In this study, we investigate the jet structure of M84, a nearby radio galaxy and a representative LLAGN, to probe jet collimation properties in a low-accretion regime. Utilizing astrometric phase-referencing observations from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), supplemented by archival Very Large Array (VLA) data, we trace the jet geometry of M84 over a broad range of scales, from approximately 10^2 to 10^7 Schwarzschild radii (rs). Our analysis reveals a well-defined transition from a semi-parabolic profile, W(r) proportional to r^0.71, to a conical shape, W(r) proportional to r^1.16, occurring at approximately 1.67 x 10^4 rs. This indicates that the M84 jet is notably less collimated than those in other known LLAGN sources. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between jet collimation and accretion rate, offering crucial constraints for jet formation models in LLAGNs.   

Can high-redshift AGN observed by JWST explain the EDGES absorption
  signal?

  The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization 21 cm Signal (EDGES) has reported evidence for an absorption feature in the sky-averaged radio background near 78 MHz. A cosmological interpretation of this signal corresponds to absorption of 21 cm photons by neutral hydrogen at $z \sim 17$. The large depth of the signal has been shown to require an excess radio background above the CMB and/or non-standard cooling processes in the IGM. Here, we explore the plausibility of a scenario in which the EDGES signal is back-lit by an excess radio background sourced from a population of radio-loud AGN at high redshift. These AGN could also explain the unexpected abundance of UV-bright objects observed at $z &gt; 10$ by JWST. We find that producing enough radio photons to explain the EDGES depth requires that nearly all high-$z$ UV-bright objects down to $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \gtrsim -15$ are radio-loud AGN and that the UV density of such objects declines by at most 1.5 orders of magnitude between $z = $10 and 20. In addition, the fraction of X-ray photons escaping these objects must be $\lesssim 1\%$ of their expected intrinsic production rate to prevent the absorption signal being washed out by early IGM pre-heating. Reproducing the sharp boundaries of the absorption trough and its flat bottom requires that the UV luminosity function, the fraction of UV light produced by AGN, and the X-ray escape fraction have fine-tuned redshift dependence. We conclude that radio-loud AGN are an unlikely (although physically possible) candidate to explain EDGES because of the extreme physical properties required for them to do so.
