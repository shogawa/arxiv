  The disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is widely regarded as a prominent formation channel of binary black hole (BBH) mergers that can be detected through gravitational waves (GWs). Besides, the presence of dense environmental gas offers the potential for an embedded BBH merger to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. In this paper, we investigate EM emission powered by the kicked remnant of a BBH merger occurring within the AGN disk. The remnant BH will launch a jet via accreting magnetized medium as it traverses the disk. The resulting jet will decelerate and dissipate energy into a lateral cocoon during its propagation. We explore three radiation mechanisms of the jet cocoon system: jet breakout emission, disk cocoon cooling emission, and jet cocoon cooling emission, and find that the jet cocoon cooling emission is more likely to be detected in its own frequency bands. We predict a soft X-ray transient, lasting for O($10^3$) s, to serve as an EM counterpart, of which the time delay O(10) days after the GW trigger contributes to follow-up observations. Consequently, BBH mergers in the AGN disk represent a novel multimessenger source. In the future, enhanced precision in measuring and localizing GWs, coupled with diligent searches for such associated EM signal, will effectively validate or restrict the origin of BBH mergers in the AGN disk.

  Galaxy gas kinematics are sensitive to the physical processes that contribute to a galaxy's evolution. It is expected that external processes will cause more significant kinematic disturbances in the outer regions, while internal processes will cause more disturbances for the inner regions. Using a subsample of 47 galaxies ($0.27&lt;z&lt;0.36$) from the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy (MAGPI) survey, we conduct a study into the source of kinematic disturbances by measuring the asymmetry present in the ionised gas line-of-sight velocity maps at the $0.5R_e$ (inner regions) and $1.5R_e$ (outer regions) elliptical annuli. By comparing the inner and outer kinematic asymmetries, we aim to better understand what physical processes are driving the asymmetries in galaxies. We find the local environment plays a role in kinematic disturbance, in agreement with other integral field spectroscopy studies of the local universe, with most asymmetric systems being in close proximity to a more massive neighbour. We do not find evidence suggesting that hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) contributes to asymmetry within the inner regions, with some caveats due to emission line modelling. In contrast to previous studies, we do not find evidence that processes leading to asymmetry also enhance star formation in MAGPI galaxies. Finally, we find a weak anti-correlation between stellar mass and asymmetry (ie. high stellar mass galaxies are less asymmetric). We conclude by discussing possible sources driving the asymmetry in the ionised gas, such as disturbances being present in the colder gas phase (either molecular or atomic) prior to the gas being ionised, and non-axisymmetric features (e.g., a bar) being present in the galactic disk. Our results highlight the complex interplay between ionised gas kinematic disturbances and physical processes involved in galaxy evolution.

  We present MEGARA (Multi-Espectr\'ografo en GTC de Alta Resoluci\'on para Astronom\'ia) Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations of 5 local type-2 quasars (QSO2s, z $\sim 0.1$) from the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample. These active galactic nuclei (AGN) have bolometric luminosities of 10$^{45.5-46}$ erg/s and stellar masses of $\sim$10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. We explore the kinematics of the ionized gas through the [O~III]$\lambda$5007 $\r{A}$ emission line. The nuclear spectra of the 5 QSO2s, extracted in a circular aperture of $\sim$ 1.2" ($\sim$ 2.2 kpc) in diameter, show signatures of high velocity winds in the form of broad (full width at half maximum; 1300$\leq$FWHM$\leq$2240 km/s and blueshifted components. We find that 4 out of the 5 QSO2s present outflows that we can resolve with our seeing-limited data, and they have radii ranging from 3.1 to 12.6 kpc. In the case of the two QSO2s with extended radio emission, we find that it is well-aligned with the outflows, suggesting that low-power jets might be compressing and accelerating the ionized gas in these radio-quiet QSO2s. In the four QSO2s with spatially resolved outflows, we measure ionized mass outflow rates of 3.3-6.5 Msun/yr when we use [S~II]-based densities, and of 0.7-1.6 Msun/yr when trans-auroral line-based densities are considered instead. We compare them with the corresponding molecular mass outflow rates (8 - 16 Msun/yr), derived from CO(2-1) ALMA observations at 0.2" resolution. Both phases show lower outflow mass rates than those expected from observational scaling relations where uniform assumptions on the outflow properties were adopted. This might be indicating that the AGN luminosity is not the only driver of massive outflows and/or that these relations need to be re-scaled using accurate outflow properties. We do not find a significant impact of the outflows on the global star formation rates.
