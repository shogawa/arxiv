  Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies host two promising phenomena of non-thermal high-energy radiation. In this regard the IceCube observation of high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy NGC 1068 is not surprising. More recently, another Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy, NGC 7469, has shown hints for neutrino emission at even higher energies. Theoretical investigations could clarify that their so-called AGN corona is the most-likely origin of these neutrinos due to the need of being partially $\gamma$-ray opaque. In this work, we present an updated version of our Seyfert-starburst composite model from 2022, that accounts for a proper treatment of the stochastic acceleration processes in the AGN corona and the secondary electrons and positrons from leptonic radiation processes. Moreover, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to study the parameter space of these two potential high-energy neutrino sources under consideration of the given prior knowledge. In the case of NGC 1068, we can successfully explain its non-thermal observational features, where both its AGN corona and starburst ring are needed to account for the observations at high- energies. In the case of NGC 7469, the high-energy signatures can only be explained assuming a small coronal radius and the including external $\gamma\gamma$-pair attenuation. In general, both sources exhibit a strong influence of the $\gamma$-ray opaqueness on the results, highlighting the need for an accurate treatment of the intrinsic coronal X-ray field and the spatial extent of the $\gamma$-ray production site.

  Galaxy mergers are believed to play an important role in triggering rapid supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. As merging nuclei approach each other, the physical properties of the participating galaxies and the associated SMBH growth are expected to evolve significantly. This study measures and characterizes these physical properties throughout the merger sequence. We constructed multiwavelength Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from hard X-rays to the far-infrared (FIR) for a sample of 72 nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. The sample comprises 64 interacting systems, including single AGNs in mergers and dual AGNs, with nuclear separations $\leq$30 kpc, as well as eight isolated active galaxies with merging features. We carefully adapted available photometric measurements at each wavelength to account for their complex morphologies and varying spatial resolutions, to perform SED fitting using CIGALE, aimed to derive critical physical properties. Our results reveal that merging galaxies hosting AGN(s) show deviations from the star-forming main sequence, and a wide range of star formation rates (SFRs). Both AGN activity and star formation are significantly influenced by the merger process, but these effects are more prominent in major, mass ratios $&lt;$4:1, interactions. We find that the projected nuclear separation is not a good tracer of the merger stage. Instead, morphological classification accurately assesses the merger progression. Based on this morphological analysis, late-stage mergers exhibit elevated SFRs (5.1$\times$), AGN luminosities (2.4$\times$), and nuclear obscuration (2.8$\times$) compared to earlier stages, supporting previous findings and reinforcing the link between merger-driven galaxy evolution and SMBH growth.

  It is well-known that star-forming galaxies (SFGs) exhibit a tight correlation between their radio and infrared emissions, commonly referred to as the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC). Recent empirical studies have reported a dependence of the IRRC on the galaxy stellar mass, in which more massive galaxies tend to show lower infrared-to-radio ratios (qIR) with respect to less massive galaxies. One possible, yet unexplored, explanation is a residual contamination of the radio emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), not captured through "radio-excess" diagnostics. To investigate this hypothesis, we aim to statistically quantify the contribution of AGN emission to the radio luminosities of SFGs located within the scatter of the IRRC. Our VLBA program "AGN-sCAN" has targeted 500 galaxies that follow the qIR distribution of the IRRC, i.e., with no prior evidence for radio-excess AGN emission based on low-resolution (~ arcsec) VLA radio imaging. Our VLBA 1.4 GHz observations reach a 5-sigma sensitivity limit of 25 microJy/beam, corresponding to a radio brightness temperature of Tb ~ 10^5 K. This classification serves as a robust AGN diagnostic, regardless of the host galaxy's star formation rate. We detect four VLBA sources in the deepest regions, which are also the faintest VLBI-detected AGN in SFGs to date. The effective AGN detection rate is 9%, when considering a control sample matched in mass and sensitivity, which is in good agreement with the extrapolation of previous radio AGN number counts. Despite the non-negligible AGN flux contamination (~ 30%) in our individual VLBA detections, we find that the peak of the qIR distribution is completely unaffected by this correction. We conclude that residual AGN contamination from non-radio-excess AGN is unlikely to be the primary driver of the M* - dependent IRRC.

  A galaxy's mid-IR spectrum encodes key information on its radiation field, star formation, and dust properties. Characterizing this spectrum therefore offers strong constraints on a galaxy's activity. This project describes a diagnostic tool for identifying main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the local Universe using IR dust emission features that are characteristic of galaxy activity. A physically-motivated sample of mock galaxy spectra has been generated to simulate the IR emission of SFGs. Using this sample, we developed a diagnostic tool for identifying MS SFGs based on machine learning methods. Custom photometric bands were defined to target dust emission features, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the dust continuum. Three bands were chosen to trace PAH features at 6.2 {\mu}m, 7.7 {\mu}m, 8.6 {\mu}m, and 11.3 {\mu}m, along with an additional band to probe the radiation field strength responsible for heating the dust. This diagnostic was subsequently applied to observed galaxies to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world applications. Our diagnostic achieves high performance, with an accuracy of 90.9% on MS SFGs (observed sample of SFGs). Additionally, it shows low contamination, with only 16.2% of AGN galaxies being misidentified as SF. Combining observational data with stellar population synthesis models enables the creation of physically-motivated samples of SFGs that match the spectral properties of real galaxies. By positioning custom photometric bands targeting key dust features, our diagnostic can extract valuable information without the need to measure emission lines. Although PAHs are sensitive indicators of star formation and interstellar medium radiation hardness, PAH emission alone is insufficient for identifying MS SFGs. Finally, we developed a physically-motivated spectral library of MS SFGs spanning from UV to FIR wavelengths.

  The reverberation mapping (RM) is the most promising method to measure the mass of supermassive black hole in the center of active galaxy nuclei (AGNs). However, the dominant jet component hinders the application of RM method for blazars. In this work, we present a new algorithm to disentangle the contributions of the accretion disk and relativistic jet in blazars by analyzing the optical spectroscopic data. Applying this method to two flat-spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089 and PKS 0736+017, we find that the H$\gamma$ variability in PKS 1510-089 lags behind the disk by approximately 116 days, while the H$\beta$ line exhibits a lag of about 52 days relative to the disk in PKS 0736+017. Based on these measured time lags, we estimate that the black hole masses are about $1.8 \times 10^8\ M_\odot$ for PKS 1510-089 and about $7.0 \times 10^7\ M_\odot$ for PKS 0736+017, respectively. This method paves the way to apply the RM method for blazars, and improves the understanding of disk and jet activities.

  Stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers occurring within the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising sources for gravitational waves detectable by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) interferometers. Some of these events have also been potentially associated with transient electromagnetic flares, indicating that BBH mergers in dense environments may be promising sources of multi-messenger signals. To investigate the prospects for electromagnetic emission from these systems, we study the dynamics of accretion flows onto BBHs embedded in AGN disks using numerical simulations. Although recent studies have explored this scenario, they often employ simplified disk models that neglect magnetic fields. In this work, we examine how strong magnetic fields influence and regulate the accretion onto such binary systems. In this context, we conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical local shearing-box simulations of a binary black hole system embedded within a magnetized disk of an AGN.   We observe that the dynamically important magnetic fields can drive the formation of well-collimated outflows capable of penetrating the vertical extent of the AGN disk. However, outflow generation is not ubiquitous and strongly depends on the radial distance of the binary from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). In particular, binaries placed at a larger distance from the central SMBH show relatively more transient accretion and the formation of stronger spiral shocks. Furthermore, accretion behavior onto the binary system via individual circum-singular disks (CSDs) is also modulated by local AGN disk properties. Our simulations highlight the importance of shear velocity in the amplification of the toroidal magnetic field component, which plays a crucial role in governing the outflow strength.

  We present a multi-frequency study of the bent-tail radio galaxy J1051+5523, located in the galaxy cluster WHL J105147.4+552309. This wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxy exhibits a complex radio morphology, characterised by a right-angled bend in the northern jet, which resembles an axe, and multiple kinks in the southern jet, as observed in the deep uGMRT radio observations. The radio power of J1051+5523 at 150 MHz is estimated to be $2.91 \times 10^{25}\,\mathrm{W\,Hz^{-1}}$, placing it in the transition zone between FRI and FRII radio galaxies. The spectral index map reveals a flat core and relatively flat lobes, which may indicate ongoing particle acceleration or a relatively young population of relativistic electrons in the lobes. Further, we estimate the equipartition magnetic fields, and spectral ages of the northern and southern lobes to be approximately 150 Myr and 153 Myr, respectively, suggesting a long-lived radio source with sustained AGN activity. A relative velocity of 278 $\pm$ 2643 $\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ is obtained for the host galaxy. Due to the large uncertainty associated with the relative velocity estimates, the contribution of ram pressure to the jet bending remains inconclusive. The low mass of the host cluster ($\sim 2 \times 10^{14}\,M_\odot$) and the lack of diffuse X-ray emission indicate a reduced likelihood of major mergers, but minor mergers or interactions remain possible. We propose that the observed WAT morphology of J1051+5523 is likely shaped by a combination of ram pressure and/or buoyant forces within the cluster environment.

  Accreting black holes are thought to swallow matter in the form of a disk and a hot cloud of plasma that glows brightly in X-rays, known as the corona. The X-ray emitting region is far too small to be directly imaged, but rapid variability of the X-ray signal can be used to infer the geometry by measuring time lags caused by material propagating towards the black hole and by coronal X-rays reflecting off the disk to imprint a reverberation lag. Reverberation lags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron emission line at $\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\sim 30$ keV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is much more challenging to detect reverberation lags from stellar-mass black holes because they are more than a million times smaller. Previous reverberation lag measurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus been limited to energies below 10 keV. Here we report on the first detection of the Compton hump reverberation feature from an X-ray binary, achieved by measuring lags in the broad energy range of $\sim 1-150$ keV. The accompanying detection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation and provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray binaries are governed by an ubiquitous process. Reverberation lags are prominent only in the most rapid variability, whereas lags in the slower variability are commonly attributed to propagating mass accretion rate perturbations. Our lag measurements up to the highest energy to date reveal that this lag in the slower variability evolves dramatically on timescales of days.
