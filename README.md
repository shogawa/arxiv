  We present the detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of 14 local (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) with outstanding photometric data from the literature covering ultraviolet-far-infrared and radio bands ($\sim$50\,MHz to $\sim$30\,GHz). We employ the CIGALE SED fitting code for ultraviolet--far-infrared--radio SED modeling. For radio-only SED modeling, we use the UltraNest package, leveraging its nested sampling algorithm. Combining results from our previous study on 11 LIRGs, we discuss the global astrophysical properties of a sample of 25 starburst galaxies ($z&lt;$0.5). Their radio spectra are frequently characterized by bends and turnovers, with no indication of ULIRGs exhibiting more complicated SEDs than LIRGs despite showing more signs of interactions. Including radio measurements in CIGALE modeling constrained the dust luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) estimates by more than one order of magnitude better than previously reported for starburst galaxies. We show that total and nonthermal radio luminosity at 1.4\, and 4.8\,GHz frequencies can be good estimators of the recent SFR for all LIRGs and those ULIRGS with insignificant AGN influence. A weaker but still significant correlation is observed between radio SFR at 1.4\,GHz and old (averaged over 100\,Myr) SFR based on SED modeling, indicative of multiple episodes of starburst activity during their lifetime. The thermal radio luminosity at 4.8\,GHz is a better tracer of recent star formation than at 1.4\,GHz. Our modeled nonthermal radio spectral indices are not statistically significantly correlated with redshift, stellar mass, SFR, specific SFR, and dust mass.

  This letter presents, for the first time, direct constraints on the black-hole-to-halo-mass relation using weak gravitational lensing measurements. We construct type I and type II Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with a mean redshift of 0.4 0.1 for type I (type II) AGNs. This sample is cross-correlated with weak lensing shear from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Northern Survey (UNIONS). We compute the excess surface mass density of the halos associated with $36,181$ AGNs from $94,308,561$ lensed galaxies and fit the halo mass in bins of black-hole mass. We find that more massive AGNs reside in more massive halos. We see no evidence of dependence on AGN type or redshift in the black-hole-to-halo-mass relationship when systematic errors in the measured black-hole masses are included. Our results are consistent with previous measurements for non-AGN galaxies. At a fixed black-hole mass, our weak-lensing halo masses are consistent with galaxy rotation curves, but significantly lower than galaxy clustering measurements. Finally, our results are broadly consistent with state-of-the-art hydro-dynamical cosmological simulations, providing a new constraint for black-hole masses in simulations.

  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are a peculiar subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Among them, TXS 1206+549 belongs to a small group of radio-loud and gamma-ray-emitting NLS1 galaxies. We focus on the radio properties of this galaxy by analysing archival, high-resolution, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging observations taken at 8 GHz frequency in six epochs between 1994 and 2018. Using the milliarcsecond-scale radio structure, we can resolve a core and a jet component whose angular separation increases by (0.055 +/- 0.006) mas/yr. This corresponds to an apparent superluminal jet component motion of (3.5 +/- 0.4) c. From the core brightness temperature and the jet component proper motion, we determine the characteristic Doppler-boosting factor, the bulk Lorentz factor, and the jet viewing angle. We find no compelling evidence for a very closely aligned blazar-type jet. The parameters for TXS 1206+549 resemble those of radio-loud quasar jets with a moderate Lorentz factor (Gamma~4) and theta~24 deg inclination to the line of sight.

  Weak-line quasars (WLQs) are a notable group of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that show unusually weak UV lines even though their optical-UV continuum shapes are similar to those of typical quasars. The physical mechanism for WLQs is an unsolved puzzle in the AGN unified model. We explore the properties of UV emission lines by performing extensive photoionization calculations based on Cloudy simulation with different spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGNs. The AGN continua are built from several observational empirical correlations, where the black-body emission from the cold disk, the power-law emission from the hot corona, and a soft X-ray excess component are considered. We find that the equivalent width (EW) of C {\footnotesize IV} from our models is systematically lower than observational values if the component of soft X-ray excess is neglected. The EW will increase several times and is roughly consistent with the observations after considering the soft X-ray excess component as constrained from normal type I AGNs. We find that the UV lines are weak for QSOs with quite large BH mass (e.g., $M_{\rm BH}&gt;10^9M_{\odot}$) and weak soft X-ray emission due to the deficit of ionizing photons. As an example, we present the strength of C {\footnotesize IV} based on the multi-band SEDs for three nearby weak-line AGNs, where the weaker soft X-ray emission normally predicts the weaker lines.

  Previous studies on the fitting of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) often apply the external-Compton process to interpret the high-energy peak of low-synchrotron-peaked (LSP) BL Lac objects (LBLs), despite the lack of strong broad emission lines observed for LBLs. In this work, we collect quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength data of 15 LBLs from the Fermi fourth LAT AGN catalog (4LAC). We propose an analytical method to assess the necessity of external photon fields in the framework of one-zone scenario. Following derived analytical results, we fit the SEDs of these LBLs with the conventional one-zone leptonic model and study their jet physical properties. Our main results can be summarized as follows. (1)We find that most LBLs cannot be fitted by the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. This indicates that external photons play a crucial role in the high-energy emission of LBLs, therefore we suggest that LBLs are masquerading BL Lacs. (2) We suggest that the $\gamma$-ray emitting regions of LBLs are located outside the broad-line region and within the dusty torus. (3) By extending the analytical method to all types of LSPs in Fermi-4LAC (using historical data), we find that the high-energy peaks of some flat spectrum radio quasars and blazar candidates of unknown types can be attributed to the SSC emission, implying that the importance of external photons could be minor. We suggest that the variability timescale may help distinguish the origin of the high-energy peak.
