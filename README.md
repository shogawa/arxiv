  A rare population of massive disk-dominated quiescent galaxies has recently drawn much attention, which intrudes the red sequence population without destroying the underlying stellar disks. In this study, we have carefully identified 48 red sequence (RS), disk-dominated galaxies with $M_{\ast} &gt; 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ between redshift 0.5 and 1.0 in all five CANDELS fields. These galaxies are well fitted by a two-component bulge plus disk model, and have the bulge-to-total ratio $B/T&lt;0.4$ in the both F814W and F160W bands. The fitting results indicate that these galaxies generally have extended stellar disks ($\rm \sim 3~kpc$ on average) and tiny bulge components ($\rm \sim 0.5~kpc$ on average). To understand their possible origins, we have also selected two control samples of 156 green valley (GV) and 309 blue cloud (BC) disk-dominated galaxies according to the same selection criteria. We study the $UVI$($U-V$ versus $V-I$) color gradients of these galaxies to infer their specific star formation rate (sSFR) gradients out to the maximum acceptable radii. We show that on average the disks in disk-dominated RS galaxies are fully quenched at all radii, whereas both the BC and GV disks are not fully quenched at any radii. We find that all the BC, GV and RS disk galaxies generally have nearly flat sSFR profiles. We propose a potential formation mechanism, acknowledging that various other mechanisms (e.g., central compaction and AGN feedback) might contribute, where massive quiescent disk-dominated galaxies are predominantly formed via a process of secular disk fading.

  Faraday rotation contains information about the magnetic field structure along the line of sight and is an important instrument in the study of cosmic magnetism. Traditional Faraday spectrum deconvolution methods such as RMCLEAN face challenges in resolving complex Faraday dispersion functions and handling large datasets. We develop a deep learning deconvolution model to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of extracting Faraday rotation measures from radio astronomical data, specifically targeting data from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS). We use semi-supervised learning, where the model simultaneously recreates the data and minimizes the difference between the output and the true signal of synthetic data. Performance comparisons with RMCLEAN were conducted on simulated as well as real data for the galaxy cluster Abell 3376. Our semi-supervised model is able to recover the Faraday dispersion with great accuracy, particularly for complex or high-RM signals, maintaining sensitivity across a broad RM range. The computational efficiency of this method is significantly improved over traditional methods. Applied to observations of Abell 3376, we find detailed magnetic field structures in the radio relics, and several AGN. We also apply our model to MeerKAT data of Abell 85, Abell 168, Abell 194, Abell 3186 and Abell 3667.
