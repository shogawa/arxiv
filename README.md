  Compact obscured nuclei (CONs) are an extremely obscured (N$_{H2}$ &gt;10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$) class of galaxy nuclei thought to exist in 20-40 per cent of nearby (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. While they have been proposed to represent a key phase of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback cycle, the nature of these CONs - what powers them, their dynamics, and their impact on the host galaxy - remains unknown. This work analyses the large-scale optical properties of the local CON, NGC4418 (z=0.00727). We present new, targeted integral field unit observations of the galaxy with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). For the first time, we map the ionised and neutral gas components of the galaxy, along with their dynamical structure, to reveal several previously unknown features of the galaxy. We confirm the presence of a previously postulated blueshifted outflow along the minor axis of NGC4418. We find this outflow to be decelerating and, for the first time, show it to extend bilaterally from the nucleus. We report the discovery of two further outflow structures: a redshifted southern outflow connected to a tail of ionised gas surrounding the galaxy and a blueshifted bubble to the north. In addition to these features, we find the [OIII] emission reveals the presence of knots across the galaxy, which are consistent with regions of the galaxy that have been photoionised by an AGN. Based on the properties of these features, we conclude that the CON in NGC4418 is most likely powered by AGN activity.

  We present an analysis of the combined NIRSpec and MIRI spectra of dusty galaxies between 1.5 - 28 $\mu$m restframe by implementing a differential extinction model, where the strength of extinction varies across the spectrum as different layers of the obscuring dust are probed. Our model is able to recover a 2D distribution of dust temperature and extinction which allows inference of the physical nature of the dust in these environments. We show that differential extinction is necessary to reproduce the spectra of 4 highly obscured Luminous Infrared Galaxies observed with NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS, where simple screen or uniformly mixed dust distributions fail to fit the data. We additionally compare the extinction of HII regions in these galaxies via hydrogen recombination lines, the extinction of molecular gas via the H$_2$ lines, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons via the 12.7/11.3 PAH ratio and the stellar continuum. We find that the molecular gas is deeply buried with the HII regions in star-forming regions, with a similar extinction to the hottest dust components. However we find the cooler dust to be less obscured, at a similar extinction to the stellar continuum and PAHs. The nuclei show a complex dust distribution with VV114 NE, NGC 3256 S, IIZw96 SW showing a deeply buried continuum source relative to the molecular gas/HII regions. Additionally, NGC 3256 S, NGC 7469 and VV114 SW show an isolated hot dust component, indicative of AGN heating, where NGC 3256 S and NGC 7469 are previously known AGN.

  Context.Unusually, there are still certain characteristics of the changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that remain undetected.Consequently,the trigger mechanism behind the CL phenomenon observed in partial AGNs remains unknown.Aims.We explore the light curve and spectral energy distribution (SED) of the CL blazar OQ 334 as obtained by Fermi-LAT. Methods. By examining the variability of the equivalent width (EW), we categorise the Fermi-LAT light curves of OQ 334 during the epoch of MJD 54628-58677 into seven distinct epochs, including the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) state, the transition state, and the BL Lac state. We obtained both a Fermi-LAT SED and a multi-wavelength SED for each of these distinct epochs. Results. The source exhibits a transformation from a quiescent state to a highly active state, as evidenced by the variability of the EW. The multi-wavelength SEDs display a prominent external Compton characteristic, even though the Fermi-LAT SED reveals both a FSRQ and a BL Lac state across the seven different epochs. To gain further insights, we employed a leptonic model that takes into account the soft photon fields originating from both synchrotron radiation and the external environment. By simulating the multi-wavelength SEDs for each epoch, we uncover the following results. Firstly, the energy density of the external photon fields evolves in an oscillatory manner over the seven different epochs. Also, the energy density of the external photon fields in the BL Lac state is lower than that in the FSRQ state.Conclusions. These findings suggest that the CL blazar represents a unique phase in the blazar sequence.

  Imaging spectropolarimetry is a new observing mode on the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that was commissioned in Cycle 30 and is available to HST observers starting in Cycle 31 (i.e., from 2023). It is a technique that is accessible from ground-based observatories, but the superb spatial resolution afforded by HST/ACS combined with the slitless nature of HST/ACS grism spectroscopy opens up the possibility of studying polarized extended emission in a way that is not currently possible even with Adaptive Optics facilities on the ground. This mode could help to study interesting targets including (but not limited to) QSOs, AGN and Radio Galaxies, ISM Dust Properties, Pre-Planetary Nebulae, Proto-Planetary and Debris Disks, Supernovae/Supernova Remnants, and Solar System objects. This research note presents the preliminary results from the calibration programs used to calibrate imaging spectropolarimetry on HST/ACS.

  Powerful outflows from active galactic nuclei (AGN) can significantly impact the gas reservoirs of their host galaxies. However, it is still unclear how these outflows can propagate from the very central regions of galaxies to their outskirts, and whether nuclear winds can be driven by and/or be responsible for drastic spectral transitions. In this work we test feedback propagation models on the case test of 2MASS 0918+2117 (2M0918), a z=0.149 X-ray variable AGN, which showed tentative evidence for nuclear ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in a 2005 XMM-Newton observation. We also investigate whether UFOs can be related to the observed X-ray variability. We observed 2M0918 with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR in 2020 to confirm the presence and characterize the UFOs. We perform a kinematic analysis of the 2005 SDSS optical spectrum to reveal and measure the properties of galaxy- scale ionized outflows. Furthermore, we construct 20-year-long lightcurves of observed flux, line-of-sight column density, and intrinsic accretion rate from the spectra of the first 4 SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys and archival observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton.We significantly detect UFOs with v$\sim$0.16c and galaxy-scale ionized outflows with velocities of $\sim$ 700 km/s. We also find that the drastic X-ray variability (factors &gt;10) can be explained both in terms of variable obscuration and variable intrinsic luminosity.Comparing the energetics of the two outflow phases, 2M0918 is consistent with momentum-driven wind propagation. 2M0918 expands the sample of AGN with both UFOs and ionized gas winds from 5 to 6, and brings the sample of AGN hosting multiscale outflows to 19, contributing to a clearer picture of feedback physics. From the variations in accretion rate, column density, and ionization level of the obscurer, we propose a scenario that connects obscurers, an accretion enhancement, and the emergence of UFOs

  There are indications that stellar-origin black holes (BHs) are efficiently paired up in binary black holes (BBHs) in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disc environments, which can undergo interactions with single BHs in the disc. Such binary-single interactions can potentially lead to an exceptionally high fraction of gravitational-wave mergers with measurable eccentricity in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. We here take the next important step in this line of studies, by performing post-Newtonian N-body simulations between migrating BBHs and single BHs set in an AGN disc-like configuration with a consistent inclusion of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the equations of motion. With this setup, we study how the fraction of eccentric mergers varies in terms of the initial size of the BBH semi-major axis relative to the Hill sphere, as well as how it depends on the angle between the BBH and the incoming single BH. We find that the fraction of eccentric mergers is still relatively large, even when the interactions are notably influenced by the gravitational field of the nearby SMBH. However, the fraction as a function of the BBH semi-major axis does not follow a smooth functional shape, but instead shows strongly varying features that originate from the underlying phase-space structure. The phase-space further reveals that many of the eccentric mergers are formed through prompt scatterings. Finally, we present the first analytical solution to how the presence of an SMBH in terms of its Hill sphere affects the probability for forming eccentric BBH mergers through chaotic three-body interactions.

  Radio jets are present in a diverse sample of AGN. However, the mechanisms of jet powering are not fully understood, and it is yet unclear to what extent they obey mass-invariant scaling relations, similar to those found for the triggering and fuelling of X-ray selected AGN. We study the incidence of eROSITA/eFEDS X-ray and LOFAR radio AGN as a function of several stellar mass normalised AGN power indicators. A new sample of radio AGN from the LOFAR-eFEDS survey is defined and we publicly release this catalogue, including host galaxy counterparts from the Legacy Survey DR9, LOFAR radio morphologies and host galaxy properties from the complete, spectroscopic (z&lt;0.4) GAMA09 survey. The fraction of GAMA09 galaxies hosting radio, X-ray and both radio and X-ray AGN are calculated as a function of the specific black hole kinetic ($\lambda_{\rm Jet}$) and radiative ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) power. The incidence of eFEDS X-ray AGN as a function of $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ shows the same mass-invariance as found in past studies. Meanwhile, radio AGN, regardless of their morphology, are more likely to be hosted in more massive galaxies, at all $\lambda_{\rm Jet}$. Across the stellar mass range, the compact radio AGN incidence follows the same power-law distribution, showing that it is not only high mass galaxies that host high power radio AGN and vice versa. On the other hand, the incidence of compact and complex radio AGN is boosted at the highest jet powers, diverging from a simple power-law. Interestingly, this increased incidence cannot be explained by more powerful radio AGN lying in more dense environments which could naturally boost their radio luminosity. Overall, we show that statistical incidence studies are a powerful method to probe disk-jet coupling for different AGN accretion modes, although future work on a more reliable determination of jet power for diverse samples of radio AGN is needed.

  We detect a highly significant excess of X-ray (2RXS) and radio (NVSS, GMRT, VLSSr) catalog sources when stacked around MCXC galaxy clusters and groups, narrowly confined within $\lesssim100\mathrm{\,kpc}$ of the $\sim2.4 R_{500}$ virial shock radius (inferred from continuum stacking), with similar X-ray ($\sim4\sigma$ for $443$ clusters) and radio ($\sim4\sigma$ for $485$ clusters) characteristics ($&gt;5\sigma$ joint). The excess sources show $10-100$ kpc scales, $L_X(0.1-2.4\mbox{ keV})\simeq10^{42-43}\mathrm{\,erg\,s^{-1}}$ or $\nu L_\nu(\nu=1.4\mbox{ GHz}) \simeq 10^{40-41}\mathrm{\,erg\,s^{-1}}$ luminosities, and a preferentially radial radio-polarization. The narrow localization and properties of the excess identify these sources not as AGN, often invoked speculatively for excess X-ray sources at cluster outskirts, but rather as infalling gaseous clumps interacting with the virial shock, probably galactic halos and possibly outflow remnants. The local excess of such discrete, radio-to-$\gamma$-ray sources around an object can probe its virial shock also at high redshifts and sub-cluster scales.
