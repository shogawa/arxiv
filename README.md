  We present a Chandra/ACIS-I study of X-ray sources in BOSS 1441, a protocluster at $z=2.32\pm0.02$ that exhibits a prominent overdensity of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). Using a 45 ks observation, we identify seven X-ray sources spatially coincident with LAE density peaks. The average X-ray photon index for the seven sources, derived from an absorbed power-law model with Galactic absorption fixed, is 1.49 (ranging from -0.68 to 2.51), corresponding to an average luminosity of $\rm 6.85\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$ in the rest-frame 2-33 keV band, with individual luminosities spanning $(3.57 - 13.96)\rm\times 10^{44}~erg~s^{-1}$. Three sources exhibit relatively flat spectral slopes. Two are associated with the MAMMOTH-1 nebula, while the third, located at the edge of BOSS 1441 with a $&gt; 5'$ offset from the LAE density peak, resides in a region with a high submillimeter-band density. We estimate the fraction of X-ray detected AGNs among the LAEs to be $11.5^{+3.8}_{-4.6}\%$, approximately double that of previously studied LAEs. This elevated fraction suggests BOSS 1441 is in a mature evolutionary stage, with even higher AGN fractions expected in massive LAEs such as PKS 1138-262. In contrast, the submillimeter galaxy population shows a lower AGN fraction ($6.9^{+6.9}_{-4.5}\%$), consistent with their typically obscured nature. These results indicate that the protocluster's massive galaxies are evolving into the bright red sequence galaxies observed in local clusters, where AGNs likely play a critical role in quenching their star formation.

  The interplay between radiative cooling of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and feedback heating governs the evolution of the universe's most massive galaxies. This paper presents simulations of feedback processes in massive galaxies showing how kinetic, thermal, and magnetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback interacts with the CGM under different environmental conditions. We find that in massive galaxies with shallower central gravitational potential and higher CGM pressure (multiphase galaxy; MPG) pure kinetic AGN feedback is most efficient in preventing CGM cooling from becoming catastrophic while maintaining the CGM entropy within the observed range. For the same galaxy, partitioning AGN energy injection into kinetic ($75\%$) and thermal ($25\%$) energy results in an entropy bump within $r\lesssim15$ kpc while also having a larger amount of cold gas extending out to $r\sim80$ kpc. A magnetohydrodynamic MPG run with seed magnetic field in the CGM (1~$\mu$G) and partial magnetised AGN feedback ($1\%$ of total AGN power) also shows a higher entropy (within $r&lt;15$ kpc) and cold gas mass, albeit the cold gas remains constrained within $r\lesssim30$ kpc. For a similarly massive galaxy with deeper potential well and low CGM pressure (single phase galaxy; SPG) our simulations show that for both hydro and MHD runs with partial thermal AGN energy, the feedback mechanism remains tightly self-regulating with centrally concentrated cooling (within $r&lt;1$ kpc). Our simulations of a similar mass galaxy with a deeper potential well and higher CGM pressure (SPG-Cool) show that our AGN feedback mechanism cannot get rid of the high CGM density and pressure and its long term evolution is similar to the multiphase galaxy.

  Magnetic effects have long been considered a possible factor in stabilizing the outer regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks against gravitational instability (GI). However, the computational demands of testing this hypothesis have prevented comprehensive study of this problem. Here, we present results from a suite of 6 isothermal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) shearing box simulations, 3 initialized with strong magnetization ($\beta^{\rm{mid}}_{0} = p_{\rm{gas}} / p_{\rm{mag}} = 10^{2.5}$) and 3 initialized with weak magnetization ($\beta^{\rm mid}_{0} = 10^{4}$). For each magnetization, we performed simulations with both strong ($Q_{0} = 1.0$) and weak ($Q_{0} = 10.0$) self-gravity, where $Q_{0} = \frac{c_{\rm{s}}\Omega}{\pi G \Sigma_{0}}$ is the Toomre stability parameter; we also performed pure MHD simulations for comparison. We find that our strongly magnetized disk stabilized against GI after initialization to critical stability against GI, while our corresponding weakly magnetized disk did not. We show that the strongly magnetized, strongly self-gravitating disk became dominated by magnetic pressure, which led to its stabilization.

  The high-redshift ($z&gt;4$) compact sources with ``V-shaped" spectral energy distributions (SEDs), known as Little Red Dots (LRDs), are discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope and provide valuable clues to the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early universe. The nature of LRDs is controversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through variability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD variability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here, we adopt the Corona-heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is motivated by accretion physics and applicable to reproduce AGN conventional variability, to study the variability of $22$ LRDs in \citet{Tee2025}. Our results indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by measurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in LRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute $\lesssim30\%$ of the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use simulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively investigate LRDs via variability: first, a sample of about $200$ LRDs; second, each LRD has two observations separated by at least two years in the observed frame; third, the photometric uncertainty is $\leq 0.07$ mag. If the LRDs still lack variability under these conditions, the time-domain study would provide independent evidence that the accretion mode of LRDs differs significantly from low-redshift quasars.
