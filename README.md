  The chemical enrichment of X-ray-emitting hot halos has primarily been studied in closed-box galaxy clusters. Investigating the metal content of lower-mass, open systems can serve as a valuable tracer for understanding their dynamical history and the extent of chemical enrichment mechanisms in the Universe. In this context, we use an 85.6 ks XMM-Newton observation to study the spatial distribution of the abundance ratios of Mg, Si, and S with respect to Fe in the hot gas of the ram-pressure-stripped M86, which has undergone morphological transformations. We report that the chemical composition in the M86 galaxy core is more similar to the rest of the hot gaseous content of the Universe than to its stellar population. This result indicate that even extreme supersonic ram-pressure is insufficient to strip the inner part of a galaxy of its hot atmosphere. Comparison with other galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping suggests that stripping the "primordial" atmosphere of a galaxy requires a combination of ram-pressure stripping and strong radio-mechanical AGN activity. The X-ray emission structures within M86, the plume and the tail, are found to be relatively isothermal. We observe that the Mg/Fe ratio in the plume is $3.3\sigma$ higher than in the M86 galaxy core and is consistent with that in the M86 group outskirts and the Virgo ICM, suggesting that the plume might originate from the low-entropy group gas due to a galaxy-galaxy collision rather than from the ram-pressure stripping of the dense galaxy core.

  The spectral variability of changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) occurred on timescales of years to tens of years, posing a significant challenge to the standard thin disk model. In this work, we propose a sandwich model, including an optically thick disk in the mid-plane (Disk 1) and two disks of low effective optical depth on both sides (Disk 2). These two types of disks are coupled with magnetic fields, which allow viscous torque interaction between them. As a consequence, the radial velocity of Disk 1 can increase by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the standard thin disk, leading to an equivalent decrease in the accretion timescale. Therefore, such a sandwich model can account for the rapid variability in CL-AGNs. In addition, we also discuss the influence of the magnetic pressure on Disk 2. When Disk 2 is dominated by the magnetic pressure, it resembles a "warm corona", which is responsible for the soft X-ray excess.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered 79 transients out to $z$$\sim$4.8 through the JADES Transient Survey (JTS), but the JTS did not find any $z$$&gt;$5 transients. Here, we present the first photometric evidence of a $z$$&gt;$5 transient/variable source with JWST. The source, AT 2023adya, resides in a $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$5.274 galaxy in GOODS-N, which dimmed from $m_{\rm F356W}$$=$26.05$\pm$0.02 mag to 26.24$\pm$0.02 mag in the rest-frame optical over approximately two rest-frame months, producing a clear residual signal in the difference image ($m_{\rm F356W}$$=$28.01$\pm$0.17 mag; SN$_\mathrm{var}$$=$6.09) at the galaxy center. Shorter-wavelength bands (F090W/F115W) show no rest-frame ultraviolet brightness change. Based on its rest-frame V-band absolute magnitude of M$_\mathrm{V}$$=$$-$18.48 mag, AT 2023adya could be any core-collapse supernova (SN) subtype or an SN Ia. However, due to low SN Ia rates at high redshift, the SN Ia scenario is unlikely. Alternatively, AT 2023adya may be a variable active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the JWST NIRCam/Grism spectrum shows no broad H$\alpha$ emission line (FWHM$=$130$\pm$26 km s$^{-1}$), disfavoring the variable AGN scenario. It is also unlikely that AT 2023adya is a tidal disruption event (TDE) because the TDE models matching the observed brightness changes have low event rates. Although it is not possible to determine AT 2023adya's nature based on the two-epoch single-band photometry alone, this discovery indicates that JWST can push the frontier of transient/variable science past $z$$=$5 and towards the epoch of reionization.

  We present nuclear (100-150 pc) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a sample of 23 nearby luminous infrared galaxies hosting a total of 28 nuclei. We gather aperture photometry from high-resolution X-ray to submillimeter data for each nuclear region localized by ALMA observations of the dust continuum. We model the broadband SEDs using X-CIGALE. Binning the merging systems by interaction class, we find that the AGN fraction (fraction of AGN infrared luminosity to total infrared luminosity) appears enhanced in the late- and post-merger stages compared to early-stage mergers. Examining the relationship between X-ray emission and infrared emission of the nuclear regions, we find that the infrared emission in the nucleus is dominated by dust and AGN, with minimal contribution from stars. We also find that nuclear regions have higher X-ray hardness ratios than the host galaxies globally among both the AGN and non-AGN population. We highlight the similarities and differences in the SEDs of dual nuclei in five closely separated late-stage merging systems: Arp 220 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 0.5 kpc), NGC 6240 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 1 kpc), IRAS 07251-0248 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 2 kpc), IRAS F12112+0305 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 4 kpc), and IRAS F14348+1447 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 6 kpc). The SEDs for these resolved pairs are distinct, suggesting that the AGN state is much more susceptible to the stellar and dust content within the immediate circumnuclear ($&lt;$150 pc) environment than to the host's global infrared luminosity or merger stage.
