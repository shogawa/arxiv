  A well-known calibrator source in radio astronomy, 3C 286 ($z=0.85$), is a compact steep-spectrum (CSS) radio source and spectroscopically classified as a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy. It is also known for its damped Ly$\alpha$ system from an intervening galaxy at $z=0.692$ detected in both ultraviolet (UV) and radio spectra. In addition, despite being a misaligned active galactic nuclei (AGN), 3C 286 is also detected in $\gamma$-rays by Fermi. Thus, this unique object combines the characteristics of CSS sources, NLS1 galaxies, and $\gamma$-ray emitters with misaligned jets, providing an excellent laboratory for extending our knowledge of AGN disk-jet coupling. Despite its significance, 3C 286 has been rarely observed in X-rays. In this study, we present our deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of 3C 286. The results reveal that the X-ray spectrum can be well described by models including an intervening absorber with redshift and column density consistent with previous UV and radio observations. The most important finding is that the spectrum cannot be described by a single power law, but a soft excess is required which is parameterized by a blackbody. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting the presence of off-nuclear X-ray emission at a radius that corresponds to the location of the radio lobes. While further theoretical work is still needed, our findings offer new clues to understand the specific mechanism for $\gamma$-ray emission from this unique object.

  Understanding the impact of baryonic physics on cosmic structure formation is crucial for accurate cosmological predictions, especially as we usher in the era of large galaxy surveys with the Rubin Observatory as well as the Euclid and Roman Space Telescopes. A key process that can redistribute matter across a large range of scales is feedback from accreting supermassive black holes. How exactly these active galactic nuclei (AGN) operate from sub-parsec to Mega-parsec scales however remains largely unknown. To understand this, we investigate how different AGN feedback models in the Fable simulation suite affect the cosmic evolution of the matter power spectrum (MPS).   Our analysis reveals that AGN feedback significantly suppresses clustering at scales $k \sim 10\,h\,cMpc^{-1}$, with the strongest effect at redshift $z = 0$ causing a reduction of $\sim 10\%$ with respect to the dark matter-only simulation. This is due to the efficient feedback in both radio (low Eddington ratio) and quasar (high Eddington ratio) modes in our fiducial Fable model. We find that variations of the quasar and radio mode feedback with respect to the fiducial Fable model have distinct effects on the MPS redshift evolution, with the radio mode being more effective on larger scales and later epochs. Furthermore, MPS suppression is dominated by AGN feedback effects inside haloes at $z = 0$, while for $z \gtrsim 1$ the matter distribution both inside and outside of haloes shapes the MPS suppression. Hence, future observations probing earlier cosmic times beyond $z \sim 1$ will be instrumental in constraining the nature of AGN feedback.

  Reprocessed X-ray radiation from active galactic nuclei (AGN) carries important information about the properties of the circumnuclear material around the black hole. The X-ray photons travel from the very center of the system and interact with that material often producing strong emission lines. The FeK$\alpha$ Compton shoulder is formed by fluorescent FeK$\alpha$ photons that perform Compton scatterings with the intercepting material and lose energy to form the distinct shoulder shape. In this work we use the ray-tracing code RefleX to explore how the physical properties of the medium, as well as its geometry, affect the shape of the Compton shoulder (CS). We start by running simulations using a simple toroidal reflector, to test the effect of the metal composition, metallicity, column density, dust presence and velocity on the FeK$\alpha$ line and its Compton shoulder. We confirm that the shape of the Compton shoulder is sensitive to the optical depth of the intercepting medium, which can be regulated by either changing the metal composition or the line of sight column density of the circumnuclear material. Next, we create a series of models, which feature different geometrical configurations of dust and gas, and explore how the Compton shoulder is affected by such configurations finding that components that can regulate the line-of-sight column density affect the FeK$\alpha$ and its CS. Finally, we test whether observatories such as the recently launched XRISM and future Athena will make the Compton shoulder a useful spectral feature of nearby AGN, by applying specific models on simulated spectra of the Circinus galaxy. The CS has the potential to be used to help constrain properties of the circumnuclear material yet with some limitations.
