  The novel Gaia Multi Peak (GMP) technique has proven to be able to successfully select dual and lensed AGN candidates at sub-arcsec separations. Both populations are important because dual AGNs represent one of the central, still largely untested, predictions of lamdaCDM cosmology, and compact lensed quasars allow to probe the central regions of the lensing galaxies. In this work, we present high spatial resolution spectroscopy of twelve GMP-selected systems. We use the the adaptive-optics assisted integral-field spectrograph MUSE at VLT to resolve each system and study the nature of each component. All the targets reveal the presence of two components confirming the GMP selection. We classify five targets as dual AGNs, two as lensed systems, and five as a chance alignment of a star and and AGN. Having separations between 0.30" and 0.86", these dual and lensed systems are, to date, among the most compact ever discovered at z &gt;0.3. This is the largest sample of distant dual AGNs with sub-arcsec separations ever presented in a single paper.

  While supermassive black holes are ubiquitous features of galactic nuclei, only a small minority are observed during episodes of luminous accretion. The physical mechanism(s) driving the onset of fueling and ignition in these active galactic nuclei (AGN) are still largely unknown for many galaxies and AGN-selection criteria. Attention has focused on AGN triggering by means of major galaxy mergers gravitationally funneling gas towards the galactic center, with evidence both for and against this scenario. However, several recent studies have found that radio-loud AGN overwhelmingly reside in ongoing or recent major galaxy mergers. In this study, we test the hypothesis that major galaxy mergers are important triggers for radio-loud AGN activity in powerful quasars during cosmic noon (1 &lt; z &lt; 2). To this end, we compare Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR observations of the z &gt; 1 3CR radio-loud broad-lined quasars to three matched radio-quiet quasar control samples. We find strong evidence for major-merger activity in nearly all radio-loud AGN, in contrast to the much lower merger fraction in the radio-quiet AGN. These results suggest major galaxy mergers are key ingredients to launching powerful radio jets. Given many of our radio-loud quasars are blue, our results present a possible challenge to the "blow-out" paradigm of galaxy evolution models in which blue quasars are the quiescent end result following a period of red quasar feedback initiated by a galaxy merger. Finally, we find a tight correlation between black hole mass and host galaxy luminosity for these different high-redshift AGN samples inconsistent with those observed for local elliptical galaxies.

  Fits the infrared spectra from the nuclear regions of AGN can place constraints on the dust properties, distribution, and geometry by comparison with models. However, none of the currently available models fully describe the observations of AGN currently available. Among the aspects least explored, here we focus on the role of dust grain size. We offer the community a new spectral energy distribution (SED) library, hereinafter [GoMar23] model, which is based on the two-phase torus model developed before with the inclusion of the grain size as a model parameter, parameterized by the maximum grain size Psize or equivalently the mass-weighted average grain size &lt; P &gt;. We created 691,200 SEDs using the SKIRT code, where the maximum grain size can vary within the range Psize = 0.01 - 10.0um ( &lt; P &gt;= 0.007 - 3.41um). We fit this new and several existing libraries to a sample of 68 nearby and luminous AGNs with Spitzer/IRS spectra dominated by AGN-heated dust. We find that the [GoMar23] model can adequately reproduce up to 85-88% of the spectra. The dust grain size parameter significantly improves the final fit in up to 90% of these spectra. Statistical tests indicate that the grain size is the third most important parameter in the fitting procedure (after the size and half opening angle of the torus). The requirement of a foreground extinction by our model is lower compared to purely clumpy models. We find that 41% of our sample requires that the maximum dust grain size is as large as Psize =10um (&lt; P &gt;= 3.41um). Nonetheless, we also remark that disk+wind and clumpy torus models are still required to reproduce the spectra of a non-negligible fraction of objects, suggesting the need for several dust geometries to explain the infrared continuum of AGN. This work provides tentative evidence for dust grain growth in the proximity of the AGN.
