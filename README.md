  Understanding the evolution of dust in galaxies is crucial because it affects the dynamics and cooling of gas, star formation, and chemical evolution. Recent work on dust removal in galaxies indicates timescales of gigayears, with old stellar populations and AGNs as the primary drivers of this process. However, most statistically significant studies are focused on low redshifts $z &lt; 0.4$. Here, we determine the dust removal timescale in galaxies over a wide range of redshifts, up to $z \sim 5$. We use publicly available catalogue data of infrared-selected galaxies, observed by \textit{Herschel}. Using the inferred dust masses, stellar masses, and stellar ages, we calculate the dust removal timescale in a sample of more than 120,000 galaxies. We find that, with increasing redshift, the dust removal timescale decreases from 1.8 Gyr at redshift $z \sim 0.05$ to less than 500\,Myr at $z &gt; 3$. Galaxies at higher redshifts undergo more efficient dust removal than galaxies at lower redshift, likely driven by AGN activity, supernova shocks, and astration. These findings indicate that dust removal evolves over cosmic time, reflecting the changing mechanisms regulating dust content of galaxies as the Universe evolves.

  We present the discovery of a peculiar central stellar structure in the collisional ring galaxy AM0644-741 using HST imaging and MUSE integral field unit (IFU) data. We identified two S\'ersic components with a S\'ersic index of 1.72 (inner part) and 1.11 (outer part) in the HST F814W band optical image using \textsc{Galfit}. We utilized the MUSE data cube to construct stellar line of sight velocity (V$_{\rm LOS}$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm LOS}$), h$_3$ \&amp; h$_4$ velocity moments, and stellar population age maps using the \textsc{GIST} pipeline for further investigating both S\'ersic components, which have a difference of $\sim$ 60 degrees in their position angle. The inner component, with an effective radius $\sim$1 kpc, shows a strong anticorrelation between V$_{\rm LOS}$/$\sigma_{\rm LOS}$ and h$_3$, indicating the presence of a rotating stellar structure. In addition, the inner component also shows a relatively higher velocity dispersion (average values reaching up to $\sim$240 km sec$^{-1}$) along with disky isophotes and stronger Mg~$b$ line strength, which all together highlight a peculiar dynamical state of AM0644-741's central region. Our analysis suggests that the recent encounter has had a smaller impact on the stellar orbits within the inner component. In contrast, it has specifically affected the stellar orbits of the progenitor's outer disk when forming the star-forming ring. The BPT analysis of the unresolved nuclear source shows a LINER-type ionization, hinting at AGN activity in the galaxy. Our study projects the dynamical evolution of collisional systems and provides scope for simulations to explore the central region in greater detail.

  We apply population synthesis techniques to analyze TYPHOON long slit spectra of the starburst barred spiral galaxy M83. The analysis covers a central square of 5 arcmin side length. We determine the spatial distribution of dust through the analysis of reddening and extinction, together with star formation rates, ages, and metallicities of young and old stellar populations. For the first time, a spatial one-to-one comparison of metallicities derived from full-spectral fitting techniques with those obtained from individual young stellar probes has been carried out. The comparison with blue supergiant stars, young massive star clusters, and super star clusters shows a high degree of concordance when wavelength coverage in the $B$-band is available. The metallicity of the young population is supersolar and does not show a radial metallicity gradient along the investigated part of the disk, in agreement with our chemical evolution model. However, a notable decrease in metallicity is observed in a tightly confined region at the galaxy center, coinciding with circumnuclear orbits. We attribute this to matter infall either from the circumgalactic medium or a dwarf galaxy interloper or, alternatively, to AGN-interrupted chemical evolution. We confirm the presence of a dust cavity with a diameter of 260~pc close to the galaxy center. Dust absorption and molecular CO emission are spatially well correlated. We find an anticorrelation between R$_V$, the ratio of dust attenuation to reddening, and the emission strength of molecular species present in photo-dissociation regions. We confirm our results by using alternative fitting algorithms and stellar libraries.

  Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGNs), which are defined by column density $\mathrm{N_H} \geqslant 1.5 \times 10^{24} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, emit feeble X-ray radiation, even undetectable by X-ray instruments. Despite this, the X-ray emissions from CT-AGNs are believed to be a substantial contributor to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB). According to synthesis models of AGNs, CT-AGNs are expected to make up a significant fraction of the AGN population, likely around 30% or more. However, only $\sim$11% of AGNs have been identified as CT-AGNs in the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDFS). To identify hitherto unknown CT-AGNs in the field, we used a Random Forest algorithm for identifying them. First, we build a secure classified subset of 210 AGNs to train and evaluate our algorithm. Our algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 90% on the test set after training. Then, we applied our algorithm to an additional subset of 254 AGNs, successfully identifying 67 CT-AGNs within this group. This result significantly increased the fraction of CT-AGNs in the CDFS, which is closer to the theoretical predictions of the CXB. Finally, we compared the properties of host galaxies between CT-AGNs and non-CT-AGNs and found that the host galaxies of CT-AGNs exhibit higher levels of star formation activity.

  In this manuscript, through applications of TDE (tidal disruption event) expected variability properties, a potential candidate for True type-2 AGN without hidden central broad line regions (=TT2AGN) is reported in the SDSS J233454.07+145712.9 (=SDSS J2334). Through analyzing the 20-years optical light curves of SDSS J2334 from different Sky Survey projects, a TDE is preferred with a $4.7{\rm M_\odot}$ main-sequence star tidally disrupted by the central BH with mass $11.7\times 10^6{\rm M_\odot}$, indicating that central region within distance about 20 light-days to central BH in SDSS J2334 is directly in the line-of-sight. Moreover, AGN activities in SDSS J2334 can be confirmed through applications of BPT diagrams. Meanwhile, comparing virial BH mass determined through assumed broad Balmer emission components and M-sigma expected BH mass by well measured stellar velocity dispersion through stellar absorption features, optical broad emission lines in SDSS J2334 are disfavored with confidence level higher than 6$\sigma$. Therefore, combining the unique properties of the TDE and the spectroscopic results with only narrow emission lines, SDSS J2334 can be well identified as a potential candidate for a TT2AGN. The results indicate the to detect TDE expected flares in normal Type-2 AGN classified by spectroscopic results should be a new practicable method for identifying

  We present simulated counterparts of the ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies ($5 \leq z \leq 8$) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses ($\rm log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9.7$), and massive black holes ($\rm log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) \geq 6.8$). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\rm 325\,pc \leq r_{{\rm half},*} \leq 620\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to their host galaxies having typical dust levels and relatively high star formation rates accompanying their highly accreting black holes, resulting in their spectra being too flat.   

NEXUS: A Spectroscopic Census of Broad-line AGNs and Little Red Dots at
  $3\lesssim z\lesssim 6$

  We present a spectroscopic sample of 23 broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs) at $3\lesssim z\lesssim 6$ selected using F322W2+F444W NIRCam/WFSS grism spectroscopy of the central 100 ${\rm arcmin^2}$ area of the NEXUS survey. Among these BLAGNs, 15 are classified as Little Red Dots (LRDs) based on their rest-frame UV-optical spectral slopes and compact morphology. The number density of LRDs is $\sim 10^{-5}\,{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$, with a hint of declining towards the lower end of the probed redshift range. These BLAGNs and LRDs span broad H$\alpha$ luminosities of $\sim 10^{42.2}-10^{43.7}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, black hole masses of $\sim 10^{6.3}-10^{8.4}\,M_\odot$, and Eddington ratios of $\sim 0.1-1$ (median value 0.4), though the black hole mass and Eddington ratio estimates carry large systematic uncertainties. Half of the LRDs show strong Balmer absorption, suggesting high-density gas surrounding the line-emitting region. We detect extended (hundreds of parsec) rest-frame UV-optical emission from the host galaxy in the majority of these LRDs, which contributes significantly or even dominantly to their total UV emission. This host emission largely accounts for the peculiar UV upturn of the LRD spectral energy distribution. We also measure the small-scale ($\lesssim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$) clustering of these BLAGNs and LRDs by cross-correlating with a photometric galaxy sample. Extrapolating the power-law two-point correlation function model to large linear scales, we infer a linear bias of $3.30_{-2.04}^{+2.88}$ and typical halo masses of a few $\times 10^{11}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ for BLAGNs at the sample median redshift of $z\sim 4.5$. However, the inferred linear bias and halo masses of LRDs, while formally consistent with those for BLAGNs at $\sim 1.5\sigma$, appear too large to be compatible with their space density, suggesting LRDs may have strong excess clustering on small scales.
