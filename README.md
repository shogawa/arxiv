  In the last decade, there have been several discoveries of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies including an AGN in an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy with a Black Hole mass $&gt;$10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$. However, finding a Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) in a dwarf Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxy is rare. We report the discovery of a Seyfert type-2 class AGN which is associated with a nuclear SMBH of mass $\sim$6.5 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ in a dwarf LSB galaxy ($\mu_{0,r}$ $&gt;$ 23.8 mag/arcsec$^{2}$) that we denote by MJ0818+2257. The galaxy was previously thought to be an outlying emission blob around the large spiral galaxy LEDA 1678924. In our current analysis, which includes the detection of the optical counterpart of MJ0818+2257, we study its ionized gas kinematics and find that the dynamical mass within the ionized gas disk is $\sim$5.3 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. This is comparable to its stellar mass which is $\sim$3$\times$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ and suggests that MJ0818+2257 is moderately dark matter-dominated within the stellar disk. The SMBH mass to galaxy stellar mass ratio is $M_{BH}/M(*)&gt;0.022$ which is high compared to disk galaxies. Our detection of a SMBH in a bulgeless LSB dwarf galaxy raises questions about the growth of SMBHs in low-luminosity galaxies and suggests the possibility of detecting heavy, seed black holes from early epochs in LSB dwarf galaxies in the low redshift universe.

  Combining Chandra, ALMA, EVLA, and Hubble Space Telescope archival data and newly acquired APO/DIS spectroscopy, we detect a double-lobed 17~kpc X-ray emission with plumes oriented approximately perpendicular and parallel to the galactic plane of the massive lenticular galaxy NGC\,5084 at 0.3--2.0~keV.   We detect a highly inclined ($i=71.2^{+1.8\circ}_{-1.7}$), molecular circumnuclear disk ($D=304^{+10}_{-11}$ pc) in the core of the galaxy rotating (V$^{\rm (2-1) CO}_{\rm rot}=242.7^{+9.6}_{-6.4}$ km s$^{-1}$) in a direction perpendicular to that of the galactic disk, implying a total mass of $\log_{10}\left( \frac{M_{\rm BH}}{M_{\odot}} \right) = 7.66^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$ for NGC\,5084's supermassive black hole. Archival EVLA radio observations at 6 cm and 20 cm reveal two symmetric radio lobes aligned with the galactic plane, extending to a distance of $\overline{R}=4.6\pm0.6$ kpc from the core, oriented with the polar axis of the circumnuclear disk. The spectral energy distribution lacks strong emission lines in the optical range.   Three formation scenarios are considered to explain these multi-wavelength archival observations: 1) AGN re-orientation caused by accretion of surrounding material, 2) AGN-driven hot gas outflow directed along the galactic minor axis, or 3) a starburst / supernovae driven outflow at the core of the galaxy. This discovery is enabled by new imaging analysis tools including \SAUNAS\ (Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal), demonstrating the abundance of information still to be exploited in the vast and growing astronomical archives.

  We present a deep X-Shooter rest-frame UV to optical spectral analysis of the heavily reddened quasar, ULASJ2315+043 at z=2.566, known to reside in a major-merger host galaxy. The rest-frame optical is best-fit by a dust-reddened quasar E(B-V)_QSO = 1.55 with black-hole mass log10(Hbeta, MBH [M_sol]) = 10.26 +\- 0.05, bolometric luminosity L_Bol = 10^48.16 erg s^-1 and Eddington-scaled accretion rate log10(\lambda_Edd) = -0.19. We find remarkable similarities between ULASJ2315+043 and the high-redshift Little Red Dots (LRDs). The rest-frame UV cannot be explained by a dusty quasar component alone and requires an additional blue component consistent with either a star-forming host galaxy or scattered AGN light. We detect broad high-ionisation emission lines in the rest-UV, supporting the scattered light interpretation for the UV excess. The scattering fraction represents just 0.05% of the total luminosity of ULASJ2315+043. Analysis of the mid infra-red SED suggests an absence of hot dust on torus-scales similar to what is observed for LRDs. The obscuring medium is therefore likely on galaxy scales. We detect narrow, blueshifted associated absorption line systems in CIV, NV, SiIV and SiIII. There is evidence for significant high-velocity (&gt;1000 km s^-1) outflows in both the broad and narrow line regions as traced by CIV and [OIII] emission. The kinetic power of the [OIII] wind is e_ion = 10^44.61 erg s^-1 ~ 0.001 L_Bol. ULASJ2315+043 is likely in an important transition phase where star formation, black-hole accretion and multi-phase gas flows are simultaneously occurring.

  We present the properties of two candidate massive ($M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$) and dusty ($A_{\rm v}&gt;2.5$ mag) galaxies at $z=5-7$ in the first 0.28 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS-Web survey. One object is spectroscopically confirmed at $z_{\rm spec}=5.051$, while the other has a robust $z_{\rm phot}=6.7\pm0.3$. Thanks to their extremely red colors ($F277W-F444W\sim1.7$ mag), these galaxies satisfy the nominal color-selection for the widely-studied ``little red dot" (LRD) population with the exception of their spatially-resolved morphologies. The morphology of our targets allows us to conclude that their red continuum is dominated by highly obscured stellar emission and not by reddened nuclear activity. Using a variety of SED-fitting tools and star formation histories, we estimate the stellar masses to be $\log(M_\star)=11.32^{+0.07}_{-0.15}$ $M_\odot$ and $\log(M_\star)=11.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ $M_\odot$, respectively, with a red continuum emission dominated by a recent episode of star formation. We then compare their number density to the halo mass function to infer stellar baryon fractions of $\epsilon_\star\sim0.25$ and $\epsilon_\star\sim0.5$. Both are significantly higher than what is commonly observed in lower-z galaxies or more dust-obscured galaxies at similar redshifts. With very bright ultra-high-z Lyman-Break Galaxies and some non-AGN dominated LRDs, such ``extended" LRDs represent another population that may require very efficient star formation at early times.
