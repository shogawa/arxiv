  We present a hybrid active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback model that features three accretion disc states (the thick, thin, and slim discs at low, moderate, and super-Eddington accretion rates, respectively), and two feedback modes: thermal isotropic and kinetic jets. The model includes black hole (BH) spin evolution due to gas accretion, BH mergers, jet spindown, and Lense-Thirring torques. The BH spin determines the jet directions and affects the feedback efficiencies. The model is implemented in the SWIFT code and coupled with the COLIBRE galaxy formation model. We present the first results from hybrid AGN feedback simulations run as part of the COLIBRE suite, focusing on the impact of new parameters and calibration efforts. Using the new hybrid AGN feedback model, we find that AGN feedback affects not just massive galaxies, but all galaxies down to $M_*\approx10^8$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$. BH spins are predicted to be near-maximal for intermediate-mass BHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}\in[10^6,10^8]$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), and lower for other BH masses. These trends are in good agreement with observations. The intergalactic medium is hotter and impacted on larger scales in the hybrid AGN feedback simulations compared to those using purely thermal feedback. In the hybrid AGN simulations, we predict that half of the cumulative injected AGN energy is in thermal and the other half in jet form, broadly independent of BH mass and redshift. Jet feedback is important at all redshifts and dominates over thermal feedback at $z&lt;0.5$ and $z&gt;1.5$, but only mildly.

  New observations with the current generation of advanced radio interferometers, such as ASKAP and MeerKAT, have led to the discovery of new classes of extended radio sources of unknown origin, including the so-called Odd Radio Circles (ORCs). These phenomena are detected exclusively in the radio continuum, with no clear counterparts at other wavelengths, making their physical nature and origin a subject of ongoing investigation. To better understand these objects, we study their radio continuum emission, spectral characteristics, and magnetic field properties. In this work, we present a radio spectropolarimetry analysis of a newly discovered ORC (ORC J0356-4216) that exhibits a rare double-ring morphology. We use data from the MeerKAT L-band and from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) at 943 MHz. ORC J0356-4216 shows a symmetric double-ring structure with a diameter of approximately 2 arcminutes, corresponding to a physical size of 668 kpc based on the redshift ($0.494 \pm 0.068$) of its apparent host galaxy WISEA J035609.67-421603.5. The radio spectra of both rings are steep, with spectral indices of $-1.18 \pm 0.03$ and $-1.12 \pm 0.05$, and show no significant substructure. Equipartition magnetic field strengths (assuming K0 = 1) are estimated to be 1.82 microGauss and 1.65 microGauss for the respective rings. The degree of polarisation across the object ranges between 20-30%, consistent with a non-thermal synchrotron origin. The morphology and polarisation are broadly consistent with large-scale shocks driven by powerful starburst outflows. However, the high degree of symmetry, the coherent double-ring structure, and the absence of internal substructure are features commonly associated with relic AGN lobes, making this scenario particularly compatible with the observed characteristics.

  We combine near-infrared imaging in two bands from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with archival observations of molecular gas to study SDSS J160705.16+533558.6 (J1607), an extremely luminous broad-line quasar at $z = 3.65$ that is also bright in the submillimeter (sub-mm). Via subtraction of the quasar point spread function, we show that its host galaxy is massive, with a stellar mass of $(5.8 \pm 3.0) \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, making it comparable to giant early-type galaxies (ETGs) at $z\sim0$. If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the quasar is accreting at the Eddington limit, then its mass is $3.5 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is also consistent with local massive ETGs. The host has an extremely high star formation rate (SFR) of $4300 \pm 500$\sfr and a molecular gas mass of $(2.4 \pm 0.9)\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. The quasar has two companions: one at a projected separation of 11 kpc with a stellar mass of $(7.9 \pm 5.0) \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ but no detected molecular gas, and one 6 kpc further away in the same direction with a molecular gas mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.3) \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ but no detected stellar emission. Since neither companion shows evidence for AGN activity, this may represent merger-driven quenching, in which the dynamics of the merger strip molecular gas from infalling galaxies. Overall, irrespective of whether the host is merging with the companions, these properties mark J1607 as forming what will become an extremely massive ($\sim10^{12}M_{\odot}$) galaxy by $z=0$.

  The origin of obscuration in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is still a matter of contention. It is unclear whether obscured AGN are primarily due to line-of-sight effects, a transitory, dust-enshrouded phase in galaxy evolution, or a combination of both. The role of an inner torus around the central SMBH also remains unclear in pure Evolution models. We use cosmological semi-analytic models and semi-empirical prescriptions to explore obscuration effects in AGN at 1&lt;z&lt;3. We consider a realistic object-by-object modelling of AGN evolution including different light curves (LCs) composed of phases of varying levels of obscuration, mimicking the possible clearing effects of strong AGN feedback. Evolution models characterized by AGN LCs with relatively short pre-peak obscured phases followed by more extended optical/UV visible post-peak phases, struggle to reproduce the high fraction of obscured AGN at z~2-3 inferred from X-ray surveys. Evolution models characterised by LCs with sharp post-peak declines or persistent or multiple obscuration phases are more successful, although they still face challenges in reproducing the steady drop in the fractions of obscured AGN with increasing luminosity measured by some groups. Invoking a fine-tuning in the input LCs, with more luminous AGN defined by longer optical/UV visible windows, can improve the match to the decreasing fractions of obscured AGN with luminosity. Alternatively, a long-lived central torus-like component, with thickness decreasing with increasing AGN power, naturally boosts the luminosity-dependent fractions of obscured AGN, suggesting that small-scale orientation effects may still represent a key component even in Evolution models. We also find that in our models major mergers and starbursts, when considered in isolation, fall short in accounting for the large fractions of highly obscured faint AGN detected at cosmic noon.
