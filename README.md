  We have performed the first systematic search of the full GALEX data archive for astrophysical variability on timescales of seconds to minutes by rebinning data across the whole mission to 30-second time resolution. The result is the GALEX Flare Catalog (GFCAT) which describes 1426 ultraviolet variable sources, including stellar flares, eclipsing binaries, $\delta$ Scuti and RR Lyrae variables, and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Many of these sources have never previously been identified as variable. We have also assembled a table of observations of ultraviolet flares and accompanying statistics and measurements, including energies, and of candidate eclipsing stars. This effort was enabled by a significantly-enhanced version of the gPhoton software for analyzing time-domain GALEX data; this gPhoton2 package is available to support follow-on efforts.

  We extend the study of the radio emission in early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the nearby Universe (recession velocity &lt;7,500 km/s) as seen by the 150 MHz Low-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) observations and extend the sample from giant ETGs to massive (~6x10^10 - 3x10^11 solar masses) ETGs (mETGS) with -25 &lt; MK &lt; -23.5. Images from the second data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey were available for 432 mETGs, 48% of which are detected above a typical luminosity of ~3x10^20 W/Hz. Most (85%) of the detected sources are compact, with sizes &lt;4 kpc. The radio emission of 31 mETGs is extended on scales ranging from 2 to 180 kpc (median 12 kpc). In several cases, it is aligned with the host galaxy. We set a limit of ~1% to the fraction of remnant or restarted objects, which is ~16% of the extended sources.   We found that the properties of the radio sources are connected with the stellar mass of the ETGs (the median radio power, the fraction of extended radio sources, and the link with the large-scale environment). However, these results only describe statistical trends because the radio properties of sources of similar stellar mass and environment show a large spread of radio properties. These trends break at the lowest host luminosities (MK&gt;-24.5). This effect is strengthened by the analysis of even less massive ETGs, with -23.5 &lt; MK &lt; -21.5. This suggests that at a mass of ~2x10^11 solar masses, a general transition occurs from radio emission produced from radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) to processes related to the host galaxy and (or) radio quiet AGN. At this luminosity, a transition in the stellar surface brightness profile also occurs from Sersic galaxies to those with a depleted stellar core, the so-called core galaxies. This finding is in line with previous results that indicated that only core galaxies host radio-loud AGN.

  We use the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) and the Deep Extragalactic Visible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) observational data sets to calculate the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) bolometric luminosity history (CSFH/CAGNH) over the last 12.5 billion years. SFRs and AGN bolometric luminosities were derived using the spectral energy distribution fitting code ProSpect, which includes an AGN prescription to self consistently model the contribution from both AGN and stellar emission to the observed rest-frame ultra-violet to far-infrared photometry. We find that both the CSFH and CAGNH evolve similarly, rising in the early Universe up to a peak at look-back time $\approx 10$~Gyr ($z \approx 2$), before declining toward the present day. The key result of this work is that we find the ratio of CAGNH to CSFH has been flat ($\approx 10^{42.5}\mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}M_{\odot}^{-1}yr}$) for $11$~Gyr up to the present day, indicating that star formation and AGN activity have been coeval over this time period. We find that the stellar masses of the galaxies that contribute most to the CSFH and CAGNH are similar, implying a common cause, which is likely gas inflow. The depletion of the gas supply suppresses cosmic star formation and AGN activity equivalently to ensure that they have experienced similar declines over the last 10 Gyr. These results are an important milestone for reconciling the role of star formation and AGN activity in the life cycle of galaxies.

  We present an X-ray analysis of fourteen nearby (z &lt; 0.044) AGN in low mass galaxies (M_* &lt;= 5*10^9 Msun) selected based on their optical variability (Baldassare et al. 2020). Comparing and contrasting different AGN selection techniques in low-mass galaxies is essential for obtaining an accurate estimate of the active fraction in this regime. We use both new and archival observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory to search for X-ray point sources consistent with AGN. Four objects have detected nuclear X-ray emission with luminosities ranging from L_0.5-7 ~ 3*10^40 to 9*10^42 erg s^-1 with two more marginal detections. All of the detected galaxies have luminosities exceeding those anticipated from X-ray binaries, and all sources are nuclear, suggesting the X-ray emission in most sources is due to an AGN. These observations demonstrate the success of variability at identifying AGN in low-mass galaxies. We also explore emission line diagnostics and discuss the differences in the results of these methods for AGN selection, in particular regarding low-mass and low-metallicity systems.
