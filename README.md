  AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact radio emission, unresolved at a scale of &lt;~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~&gt; 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.

  Early results from JWST uncover a peculiar class of objects referred to as ``little red dots'' (LRDs). The extremely compact morphology of LRDs is often invoked to point towards an AGN-dominated picture in the context of their conflicting multiwavelength properties. In this work, we assess the capability of pysersic and GALFIT -- commonly used tools in LRD morphological studies -- to recover input parameters for a simulated suite of LRD-like objects in the F444W band. We find that: 1) these tools have difficulty recovering input parameters for simulated images with SNR $\lesssim 25$; 2) estimated PSF fraction could be a more robust physically-motivated description of LRD compactness; and 3) almost all permutations of modeled LRDs with SNR $\lesssim 50$ cannot be differentiated from a point source, regardless of intrinsic extent. This has serious implications on how we interpret morphological results for increasingly large photometric samples of LRDs, especially at extremely high-$z$ or in relatively shallow fields. We present results of Sersic and two-component fitting to a sample of observed LRDs to compare with our mock sample fitting. We find that $\sim85\%$ of observed LRDs are PSF-dominated, consistent with the AGN-dominated interpretation. The remaining $\sim15\%$ have low estimated PSF fractions (two-component fit) and sizes $\gtrsim 150$ pc (Sersic). This morphological diversity of LRDs suggests that that the population likely is not homogeneous. It possibly has a primary subset of sources consistent with the AGN-dominated hypothesis, and a secondary population of sources more consistent with arising perhaps from extremely compact starbursts.

  Galaxy mergers funnel gas toward the nuclei, igniting starbursts and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN feedback can reshape the host galaxy and regulate both star formation and super-massive black-hole (SMBH) accretion. Using VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy, we conduct a spatially resolved study of the triple-AGN candidate SDSS J0849+1114. Extended ionized gas structures ($&gt;10$ kpc from nucleus A) primarily associated with tidal tails are detected. Meanwhile, two distinct ionized gas outflows are revealed. One extends over $&gt;5$ kpc around nuclei A with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,A} = 3.0\times10^{42}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$, which might be driven by the radio jet. The other outflow extends $\sim 5.9$ kpc around nucleus C, with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,C} = 2.0\times10^{40}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$. High [O III]/H$\alpha$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios in the tidal gas require that nucleus A radiated at a high accretion rate with $L_{\rm A,bol} \sim 0.1$--$0.5\,L_{\rm Edd,A}$ at least $\sim3$--$\times10^{4}\rm\,yr$ ago, $20$--$100$ times brighter than today. Combined with multi-wavelength constraints, we find evidence for episodic AGN feedback that expelled circumnuclear gas and rapidly quenched accretion. This triple AGN candidate demonstrates how AGN feedback can self-regulate black hole growth and impact hosts during mergers.

  We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of NGC 5005, a LINER-dominated galaxy previously reported to host a broad H$\alpha$ emission line. The diffuse soft X-ray emission ($&lt;$3 keV) extends out to $\sim$800 pc, while harder emission ($&gt;$3 keV) is confined to the central $\sim$400 pc. Spatially resolved spectroscopy of the nuclear ($r&lt;150$ pc) and extended ($150&lt;r&lt;500$ pc) regions reveals that these are best described by models including both photoionized and thermal plasma components, consistent with excitation by a low-luminosity AGN and shock-heated gas. Narrow-band imaging and excitation maps from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) support this interpretation, closely matching the X-ray morphology and ionization structure. The detection of a faint hard X-ray nuclear source with Chandra, combined with stringent upper limits from NuSTAR and Swift, and consistency with the X-ray luminosity predicted from the HST [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission, indicates that NGC 5005 hosts an intrinsically low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$), unobscured AGN. Despite the extremely low Eddington ratio inferred from our measurements ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$), the presence of a broad H$\alpha$ line in the optical spectrum suggests the persistence of a thin accretion disk, challenging standard paradigms of accretion flow configurations at such low accretion rates.

  We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258, a critical benchmark for extragalactic mass measurements. We use archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (G235H/F170LP grating) to extract high-resolution two-dimensional stellar kinematics from the CO bandhead absorption features within the central $3'' \times 3''$. We extract the stellar kinematics after correcting for instrumental artifacts and separating the stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We employ Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) to fit the observed kinematics, exploring a grid of 12 models to systematically test the impact of different assumptions for the point-spread function, stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) profile, and orbital anisotropy. All 12 models provide broadly acceptable fits, albeit with minor differences. The ensemble median and 68% (1$\sigma$) bootstrap confidence intervals of our 12 models yield a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (4.08^{+0.19}_{-0.33}) \times 10^7$ M$_\odot$. This paper showcases the utility of using the full model ensemble to robustly account for systematic uncertainties, rather than relying on formal errors from a single preferred model, as has been common practice. Our result is just 5% larger than, and consistent with, the benchmark SMBH mass derived from water maser dynamics, validating the use of NIRSpec stellar kinematics for robust SMBH mass determination. Our analysis demonstrates JWST's capability to resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence and deliver precise dynamical masses, even in the presence of significant AGN continuum emission.

  Recent photometric surveys with JWST have revealed a significant population of mysterious objects with red colours, compact morphologies, frequent signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and negligible X-ray emission. These 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs) have been explored through spectral and photometric studies, but their nature is still under debate. As part of the BlackTHUNDER survey, we have observed UNCOVER_20466, the second most distant LRD known (z=8.5), with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU. Previous JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec MSA observations of this source revealed its LRD nature, as well as the presence of an AGN. Using our NIRSpec IFU data, we confirm that UNCOVER_20466 contains an overmassive black hole. However, our observed Balmer decrements imply negligible dust attenuation, resulting in a much lower Hbeta-based bolometric luminosity and Eddington luminosity (~10%) than previously found. Lyman-alpha emission is strongly detected, implying f_esc,Lya~30%. The extremely high [OIII]4363/Hgamma ratio is indicative of not only AGN photoionization and heating, but also extremely high densities (ne~10^7cm-3), suggesting that this black hole at such high redshift may be forming in an ultra-dense protogalaxy.

  JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5&lt;z&lt;7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.

  We study star formation over 12 Gyr using pop-cosmos, a generative model trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 $&lt;26$). The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star formation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\pm0.01$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent (Q) galaxies using specific SFR $&lt;10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$ colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent fractions across $0&lt;z&lt;3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by galaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass function shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($&lt;10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$) Q galaxies at $z\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase. Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback time ($r\sim1$ to $r\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r&gt;0.95$) during the most recent $\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive ($10&lt;\log_{10}(M_*/$M$_{\odot})&lt;11$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of $\sim1$ Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive ($\sim10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$) galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states, declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the $\sim1$ Gyr quenching transition.
