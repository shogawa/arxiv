  We present a set of new theoretical Fe II templates for bright quasars covering a wavelength range of 1000-10000 \AA, based on the recent atomic database available in the C23.00 version of the photoionization code CLOUDY. We compute a grid of models for a range of incident photon flux and gas density and for multiple microturbulence velocities. We analyze the ratios of Fe II emission over a variety of wavebands and compare them with observations. Our key results are: (1) Despite the use of the newest atomic data we still confirm the long-standing problem that the predicted Fe II UV/optical ratio is significantly larger than that observed in the AGN spectra. (2) The ratio is not significantly affected by the variations in the microturbulence and the metallicity. (3) The turbulence can create an additional apparent velocity shift of up to 1000 km/s in the spectra. (4) There is no single Fe II template that can fit the observational data covering UV to optical wavelength range. We shortly discuss the most likely effects responsible for the Fe II UV/optical mismatch problem: the assumption of the constant column density and the assumption of the isotropic emission implying equal contribution of the bright irradiated faces and the dark shielded faces of the clouds.

  In this manuscript, very blue-shifted broad H$\alpha$ with shifted velocity $\sim$2200km/s is reported in the low redshift Type-1.9 AGN SDSS J1052+1036. Blue-shifted broad emission lines may arise due to the presence of a rotating gas disk around central black hole (BH), but may also be a signature of rare phenomena such as gravitational wave recoil of a supermassive BH (rSMBH) or the presence of a binary BH (BBH) system. Here, due to larger shifted velocity of stronger and wider blue-shifted broad H$\alpha$, the BBH system is disfavoured. Meanwhile, if this object contained a rSMBH, intrinsic obscuration with E(B-V)$\le$0.6 should lead to a detectable broad H$\beta$, indicating the rSMBH scenario not preferred. We find that the blue-shifted broad H$\alpha$ can be well explained by emission from an AGN disk, indicating that SDSS J1052+1036 is likely a disk-emitting AGN. In order to determine which scenario, a rSMBH or a disk emitter, is more preferred, a re-observed spectrum in 2025 can provide robust clues, with a disk emitter probably leading to clear variations of peak positions, peak separations and/or peak intensity ratios in broad H$\alpha$, but with a rSMBH scenario probably leading to no variations of peak separations in broad H$\alpha$.
