  (Abridged) Cluster environment has a strong impact on the star formation rate and AGN activity in cluster galaxies. In this work, we investigate the behaviour of different galaxy populations in galaxy clusters and their vicinity by means of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We studied galaxies with stellar mass $\log M_\ast (M_\odot) &gt; 10.15$ in galaxy clusters with mass $M_{500} &gt; 10^{13} M_\odot$ extracted from box2b (640 comoving Mpc/$h$) of the Magneticum Pathfinder suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations at redshifts 0.25 and 0.90. We examined the influence of stellar mass, distance to the nearest neighbouring galaxy, clustercentric radius, substructure membership and large-scale surroundings on the fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN, star formation rate and the ratio between star-forming and quiescent galaxies. We found that in low-mass galaxies, AGN activity and star formation are similarly affected by the environment and decline towards the cluster centre. In massive galaxies, the impact is different; star-formation level increases in the inner regions and peaks between 0.5 and 1 $R_{500}$ with a rapid decline in the centre, whereas AGN activity declines in the inner regions and rapidly rises below $R_{500}$ towards the centre - likely due to stellar mass stripping and the consequent selection of galaxies with more massive black holes. After disentangling the contributions of neighbouring cluster regions, we found an excess of AGN activity in massive galaxies on the cluster outskirts ($\sim 3 R_{500}$). We also found that the local density, substructure membership and stellar mass strongly influence star formation and AGN activity but verified that they cannot fully account for the observed radial trends.

  We explore the role of galactic feedback on the low redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$)~forest ($z \lesssim 2$) statistics and its potential to alter the thermal state of the intergalactic medium. Using the Cosmology and Astrophysics with Machine Learning Simulations (CAMELS) suite, we explore variations of the AGN and stellar feedback models in the IllustrisTNG and Simba sub-grid models. We find that both AGN and stellar feedback in Simba play a role in setting the Ly$\alpha$ forest column density distribution function (CDD) and the Doppler width ($b$-value) distribution. The Simba AGN jet feedback mode is able to efficiently transport energy out to the diffuse IGM causing changes in the shape and normalization of the CDD and a broadening of the $b$-value distribution. We find that stellar feedback plays a prominent role in regulating supermassive black hole growth and feedback, highlighting the importance of constraining stellar and AGN feedback simultaneously. In IllustrisTNG, the AGN feedback variations explored in CAMELS do not affect the Ly$\alpha$ forest, but varying the stellar feedback model does produce subtle changes. Our results imply that the low-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ forest can be sensitive to changes in the ultraviolet background (UVB), stellar and black hole feedback, and that AGN jet feedback in particular can have a strong effect on the thermal state of the IGM.

  We present Fabry-P\'erot (FP) imaging and longslit spectroscopy of the nearby Seyfert II galaxy NGC 1068 using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) to observe the impact of the central Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) on the ionized gas in the galaxy on kiloparsec scales. With SALT RSS FP we are able to observe the H$\alpha$+[N II] emission line complex over a $\sim$2.6 arcmin$^2$ field of view. Combined with the longslit observation, we demonstrate the efficacy of FP spectroscopy for studying nearby Type II Seyfert galaxies and investigate the kiloparsec-scale ionized gas in NGC 1068. We confirm the results of previous work from the TYPHOON/Progressive Integral Step Method (PrISM) survey that the kiloparsec-scale ionized features in NGC 1068 are driven by AGN photoionization. We analyze the spatial variation of the AGN intensity to put forward an explanation for the shape and structure of the kiloparsec-scale ionization features. Using a toy model, we suggest the ionization features may be understood as a light-echo from a burst of enhanced AGN activity $\sim$2000 years in the past.

  Some Seyfert galaxies are detected in high-energy gamma rays, but the mechanism and site of gamma-ray emission are unknown. Also, the origins of the cosmic high-energy neutrino and MeV gamma-ray backgrounds have been veiled in mystery since their discoveries. We propose emission from stellar-mass BHs (sBHs) embedded in disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) as their possible sources. These sBHs are predicted to launch jets due to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, which can produce intense electromagnetic, neutrino, and cosmic-ray emissions. We investigate whether these emissions can be the sources of cosmic high-energy particles. We find that emission from internal shocks in the jets can explain gamma rays from nearby radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies including NGC1068, if the Lorentz factor of the jets ($\Gamma_{\rm j}$) is high. On the other hand, for moderate $\Gamma_{\rm j}$, the emission can significantly contribute to the background gamma-ray and neutrino intensities in the $\sim {\rm MeV}$ and $\lesssim {\rm PeV}$ bands, respectively. Furthermore, for moderate $\Gamma_{\rm j}$ with efficient amplification of the magnetic field and cosmic-ray acceleration, the neutrino emission from NGC1068 and the ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays can be explained. These results suggest that the neutrino flux from NGC1068 as well as the background intensities of ${\rm MeV}$ gamma rays, neutrinos, and the ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays can be explained by a unified model. Future MeV gamma-ray satellites will test our scenario for neutrino emission.

  The combined study of the flaring of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at radio wavelengths and pc-scale jet kinematics with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has led to the view that i) the observed flares are associated with ejections of synchrotron blobs from the core, and ii) most of the flaring would follow a one-to-one correlation with the component ejection. Recent results have provided mounting evidence that the quasi-regular component injections into the relativistic jet may not be the only cause of the flux variability. We propose that AGN flux variability and jet morphology changes can both be of deterministic nature, i.e. having a geometric/kinetic origin linked to the time-variable Doppler beaming of the jet emission as its direction changes due to precession (and nutation). The physics of the underlying jet leads to shocks, instabilities, or to ejections of plasmoids. The appearance (morphology, flux, etc.) of the jet can, however, be strongly affected and modulated by precession. We demonstrate this modulating power of precession for OJ 287. For the first time, we show that the spectral state of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) can be directly related to the jet's precession phase. We model the SED evolution and reproduce the precession parameters. Further, we apply our precession model to eleven prominent AGN. We show that for OJ 287 precession seems to dominate the long-term variability ($\gtrsim 1\,{\rm yr}$) of the AGN flux, SED spectral state, and jet morphology, while stochastic processes affect the variability on short timescales ($\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm yr}$).
