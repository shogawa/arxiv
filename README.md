  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by accretion disks onto supermassive black holes in the the centers of galaxies. AGN are believed to play important roles in the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies over cosmic time. AGN and the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that interact with them remain unresolved with present and planned telescopes. As a result, the properties of AGN and NSCs are highly uncertain. Here we review how binary black hole (BBH) mergers can occur in AGN disks and how both the gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic wave (EM) properties of such mergers allow us to reverse-engineer the properties of AGN disks and NSCs over cosmic time. We point out that the feature in the BBH mass spectrum around $\sim 35M_{\odot}$ is an excellent probe of hierarchical merger models. Likewise constraints on the spins of upper-mass gap BH ($\gtrsim 50M_{\odot}$) test the AGN channel. The effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) distribution, including asymmetry, islands of structure and magnitudes are excellent tests of AGN model predictions. We also argue, that the rate of AGN-driven BBH mergers as a function of redshift should scale slightly shallower than the AGN number density, at least out to redshifts of $\sim 2$, and should turnover at the same redshift as the AGN number density. Finally, we emphasize a determination of an AGN fraction of observed BBH mergers ($f_{\rm BBH,AGN}$), \emph{regardless of the actual value}, allows us to infer the average properties of AGN disks and NSCs out to high redshift.

  We present a census of the Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nucleus (AGN) population and the column density ($N_{\rm{H}}$) distribution of AGN in our cosmic backyard using a mid-infrared selected AGN sample within 15 Mpc. The column densities are measured from broadband X-ray spectral analysis, mainly using data from $\textit{Chandra}$ and $\textit{NuSTAR}$. Our sample probes AGN with intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosities of $L_{\rm 2-10, int} = 10^{37}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, reaching a parameter space inaccessible to more distant samples. We directly measure a 32$^{+30}_{-18}\%$ CT AGN fraction and obtain an $N_{\rm{H}}$ distribution that agrees with that inferred by the $\textit{Swift}$-BAT survey. Restricting the sample to the largely unexplored domain of low-luminosity AGN with $L_{\rm 2-10, int}$ $\leq$ $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we found a CT fraction of 19$^{+30}_{-14}\%$, consistent with those observed at higher luminosities. Comparing the host-galaxy properties between the two samples, we find consistent star formation rates, though the majority of our galaxy have lower stellar masses (by $\approx 0.3$ dex). In contrast, the two samples have very different black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) distributions, with our sample having $\approx$1.5 dex lower mean mass ($M_{\rm BH}$ $\sim$ 10$^{6}$ $M_\odot$). Additionally, our sample contains a significantly higher number of LINERs and H$_{\rm{II}}$-type nuclei. The Eddington ratio range probed by our sample, however, is the same as $\textit{Swift}$-BAT, although the latter dominates at higher accretion rates, and our sample is more evenly distributed. The majority of our sample with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \ge$ 10$^{-3}$ tend to be CT, while those with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} &lt;$ 10$^{-3}$ are mostly unobscured or mildly obscured.

  Galactic latitudes

  Large number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) producing Very-High-Energy (VHE) gamma-rays (energies above 100~GeV) has been revealed using observations with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). However, our knowledge of the VHE emitting AGN population is limited in the absence of an unbiased sky survey. We use long exposure of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to perform a survey of VHE emitting AGN at Galactic latitudes |b|&gt;10 degrees. We consider clustering of gamma-ray events with energies E&gt;100 GeV around positions of AGN from the 4-th LAT source catalog to select sources detected in the VHE range. The VHE AGN catalog produced in this way contains overall 175 sources detected with high confidence and additional 100 sources detected at more than 3-sigma level. It is 90% complete at the flux limit 1.3e-12 erg/cm2s. Less than half of the source sample (71) are previously reported VHE emitters, other sources are new detections in the VHE band. The majority of VHE AGN detectable at the survey flux limit are BL Lac type objects. We find their luminosity function to derive their spatial density (6.5+/-0.5)e-7/ Mpc3 and the characteristic luminosity scale ~1e44 erg/s. Ten sources in the VHE AGN catalog are nearby radio galaxies and seven are flat spectrum radio quasars, while 20 sources are unclassified AGN. We also include in our catalog four unidentified sources that may or may not be VHE AGN. 63 source in the catalog are "extreme" blazars, with 41 of them being new VHE band detections. In spite of the fact that the VHE flux is heavily attenuated by the pair production in interactions with Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), the catalog includes 7 sources at redshift larger than 1. Some of these sources show peculiar hardening of the VHE band spectra that point either to errors in redshift determination, or to limitations of modeling of cosmological evolution of EBL.

  We have examined the nuclear spectra of very massive star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 0$ to understand how they differ from other galaxies with comparable masses, which are typically passive. We selected a sample of 126 nearby massive star-forming galaxies ($&lt;100~{\rm Mpc}$, $10^{11.3}~\rm{M_\odot} \leq M_{\rm stellar} \leq 10^{11.7}~\rm{M_\odot}$, $1 ~{\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1}}&lt; {\rm SFR} &lt;13 ~{\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1}}$) from the 2MRS-Bright WXSC catalogue. LEDA morphologies indicate at least 63\% of our galaxies are spirals, while visual inspection of Dark Energy Survey images reveals 75\% of our galaxies to be spirals with the remainder being lenticular. Of our sample 59 have archival nuclear spectra, which we have modelled and subsequently measured emission lines ([NII]$\rm{\lambda 6583}$, H$\alpha\rm{\lambda 6563}$, [OIII]$\rm{\lambda 5008}$, and H$\beta\rm{\lambda 4863}$), classifying galaxies as star-forming, LINERS, or AGNs. Using a BPT diagram we find $83 \pm 6$ \% of our galaxies, with sufficient signal-to-noise to measure all 4 emission lines, to be LINERs. Using the [NII]$\rm{\lambda 6583}$/H$\alpha\rm{\lambda 6563}$ emission line ratio alone we find that $79 \pm 6$ \% of the galaxies (46 galaxies) with archival spectra are LINERs, whereas just $\sim 30\%$ of the overall massive galaxy population are LINERs (Belfiore et al. 2016). Our sample can be considered a local analogue of the Ogle et al. (2016, 2019) sample of $z \sim 0.22$ massive star-forming galaxies in terms of selection criteria, and we find 64\% of their galaxies are LINERs using SDSS spectra. The high frequency of LINER emission in these massive star-forming galaxies indicates that LINER emission in massive galaxies may be linked to the presence of gas that fuels star formation.

  Internal gas inflows driven by galaxy mergers are considered to enhance star formation rates (SFR), fuel supermassive black hole growth and stimulate active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, quantifying these phenomena remains a challenge, due to difficulties both in classifying mergers and in quantifying galaxy and AGN properties. We quantitatively examine the merger-SFR-AGN connection using Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) galaxies using novel methods for both galaxy classification and property measurements.} {Mergers in HSC-SSP observational images are identified through fine-tuning Zoobot, a pretrained deep representation learning model, using images and labels based on the Galaxy Cruise project. We use galaxy and AGN properties that were produced by fitting Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectra using the SED fitting code ProSpect, which fits panchromatically across the far-UV through far-infrared wavelengths and obtains galaxy and AGN properties simultaneously.} \textbf{{Little differences are seen in SFR and AGN activity between mergers and controls, with $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.009\pm 0.003$ dex, $\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=-0.010\pm0.033$ dex and $\Delta L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.002\pm0.025$ dex. After further visual purification of the merger sample, we find $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.033\pm0.014$ dex, $\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=-0.024\pm0.170$ dex, and $\Delta L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.019\pm0.129$ dex for pairs, and $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.057\pm0.024$ dex, $\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.286\pm0.270$ dex, and $\Delta L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.329\pm0.195$ dex for postmergers. These numbers suggest secular processes being an important driver for SF and AGN activity, and present a cautionary tale when using longer timescale tracers.

  In this new era of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, various new transients and new phenomena are constantly being discovered thanks to the rapid advances in observations, which provide the excellent opportunity to study the physics in the extreme environments. The enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP), planned to be launched in 2030, has several key advantages, including advanced polarimetry, high sensitivity &amp; large effective area, and wide energy range coverage, which make it a groundbreaking project in high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave (GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and TeV active galactic nucleus (AGNs), and so on. We discuss the advantages of future eXTP observations for detecting these sources, their detection capabilities, the abilities to distinguish theoretical models, and their applications in gravity and cosmology.

  Scheduled for launch in 2030, the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization (eXTP) telescope is a Chinese space-based mission aimed at studying extreme conditions and phenomena in astrophysics. eXTP will feature three main payloads: Spectroscopy Focusing Arrays (SFAs), Polarimetry Focusing Arrays (PFAs), and a Wide-field Camera (W2C). This white paper outlines observatory science, incorporating key scientific advances and instrumental changes since the publication of the previous white paper [1]. We will discuss perspectives of eXTP on the research domains of flare stars, supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, AGN, and pulsar-based positioning and timekeeping.   

Measuring monster MBHs: maybe mighty, maybe merely massive

  Accurate black hole mass (MBH) measurements in high-z galaxies are difficult yet crucial to constrain the growth of supermassive BHs, and to discriminate between competing BH seed models. Recent studies claimed the detection of massive BHs in very distant AGN, implying extreme growth conditions. However, these estimates are usually obtained by extrapolating indirect methods that are calibrated for moderately accreting, low-luminosity AGN in the local universe. To assess the reliability of the single epoch method (SE) in the distant universe, we compute the MBH for a sample of hyper-luminous distant quasars and a sample of highly accreting AGN using the X-ray scaling method. We first verify that this X-ray method yields reliable MBH values for distant highly accreting objects. Then, we carry out a systematic comparison with the SE method and find that these two indirect methods yield consistent MBH over a broad range of luminosities, intrinsic absorption, and accretion rates. The only discrepancies are associated with AGN that are substantially absorbed (underestimated by the SE method), and AGN accreting well above the Eddington limit (overestimated by the SE method). The latter result casts some doubts on the claim of overmassive BHs in highly accreting AGN in the early universe. Our study also reveals that one of the frequently used AGN catalogs consistently underestimates the MBH values by a factor of 2.5. Although this factor is of the order of the uncertainty generally associated with the SE method, we demonstrate that the use of underestimated values may result in potentially misleading conclusions. Specifically, for this AGN sample we confirm strong positive correlations for Gamma vs. lambda_Edd and for the X-ray bolometric correction vs. lambda_Edd, as well as for Gamma vs. the soft excess strength, at odds with the conclusions inferred using underestimated MBH values.   

The impact of applying black hole-host galaxy scaling relations to large
  galaxy populations

  Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with dynamically measured masses have shown empirical correlations with host galaxy properties. These correlations are often the only method available to estimate SMBH masses and gather statistics for large galaxy populations across a range of redshifts, even though the scaling relations themselves are derived from a small subset of nearby galaxies. Depending on the scaling relation used, estimated SMBH masses can vary significantly. The most widely used scaling relations are the M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ and M$_{BH}- \sigma$ relations, where M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ is galaxy bulge mass and $\sigma$ is the bulge velocity dispersion. In this paper, we determine how severely the choice of scaling relation impacts SMBH mass estimates for different subsets of a large galaxy population. For this analysis we use a sample of $\sim$ 400,000 galaxies, including 1,240 Type 1 AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We calculate SMBH masses from M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ and M$_{BH}- \sigma$ and compare to single-epoch virial SMBH masses from broad-line H$\beta$, which are derived independently of black hole-host galaxy scaling relations. We find that SMBH masses derived from the single-epoch virial relation for H$\beta$ are better reproduced by M$_{BH}- \sigma$ than M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$. Finally, in cases where $\sigma$ and M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ cannot be measured directly, we show that it is possible to infer $\sigma$ from photometry with more accuracy than we can infer M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$.

  The dusty and molecular torus is one of the most elusive structures surrounding supermassive black holes, yet its importance is unequivocal for understanding feedback and accretion mechanisms. The torus and accretion disk feed the inspiraling gas onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and launch outflows, fundamentally connecting the SMBH activity to the host galaxy. This scenario situates the torus as the interface between the AGN and its host galaxy with a flow cycle of molecular gas and dust of a few parsecs in size. Here, we utilize a novel aperture-masking interferometric mode onboard the JWST, achieving twice the previously possible resolution, and bringing out the fainter features that clearly show the torus being the critical interface for feeding material from galaxy scales into the SMBH. We also identify that $&lt;1$% of the emission arises from an arc structure composed of hot dust entrained in a molecular and ionized outflow. The rest of the emission, $12$%, is associated with dust heated by the AGN and/or radio-jet at large scales. Combined with continuum data, gas tracers, and torus models, our study shows that most of the dust mass is located in the equatorial axis in the form of a disk feeding the AGN.
