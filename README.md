  Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at $2\lesssim z \lesssim 11$, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at $z=7.04$. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H$\beta$ tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H$\beta$ narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of $M_{\rm dyn}&lt;4 \times 10^8~M_{\odot}$, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense ($n_{\rm H}\sim 10^{10}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H$\beta$ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection ($3\sigma$) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.

  Variability studies offer a compelling glimpse into black hole dynamics, and NICER's (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) remarkable temporal resolution propels us even further. NICER observations of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), NGC 4051, have charted the geometry of the emission region of the central supermassive black hole. Our investigation of X-ray variability in NGC 4051 has detected extreme variations spanning a factor of 40 to 50 over a mere 10 to 12 hours. For the first time, we have constrained the X-ray Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the source to 0.1 Hz, corresponding to a temporal frequency of 10,000 Hz in a galactic X-ray binary (GXRB) with a mass of 10 M_{\odot}. No extra high-frequency break/bend or any quasi-periodic oscillations are found. Through detailed analysis of energy-dependent PSDs, we found that the PSD normalization, the high-frequency PSD slope as well as the bending frequency remains consistent across all energies within the 0.3-3 keV band, revealing the presence of a constant temperature corona. These significant findings impose critical constraints on current models of X-ray emission and variability in AGN.

  Light-travel-time delays provide one of the most powerful ways of learning about the structure and kinematics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Estimating delays from observations of AGN variability presents statistical challenges because the time series are almost invariably irregularly sampled. Correct assessment of errors in lag estimates is important for evaluating results. The most widely used method of determining phase lags has been the interpolated cross-correlation function method introduced by Gaskell and Sparke (1986, GS). It is shown here that the widely used modified smooth bootstrap method of Peterson et al. (1998) significantly overestimates the error in lags derived using the GS, especially for poorly sampled light curves. The remarkably high accuracy claimed for lags obtained by the JAVELIN method of Zu et al. (2011) (more than an order of magnitude improvement for 25% of cases) is spurious and the accuracy no better than the GS method. A related method proposed by Li et al. (2013) suffers from similar but less serious problems. A slightly modified version of the analytic formula of Gaskell and Peterson (1987) gives an easy and accurate way of estimating lag errors for well-sampled, high-quality data. The width of the continuum autocorrelation function is shown to be proportional to the square root of the luminosity. This is useful in planning observing campaigns. The discrete correlation function method is less powerful than the GS method and for many typical situations gives errors in the lag twice as large as those of the GS method.

  The wide survey of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will observe a large field of 17,500 $\text{deg}^2$. The GU, GV, and GI grism observations of CSST will cover a wavelength range from 2550 to 10000\r{A} at a resolution of $R\sim 200$ and a depth of about 22 AB magnitude for the continuum. In this paper, we present a pipeline to identify quasars and measure their physical properties with the CSST mock data. We simulate the raw images and extract the one-dimensional grism spectra for quasars, galaxies, and stars with the r-band magnitudes of $18&lt;\text{m}_{\text{r}}&lt;22$ using the CSST Cycle 6 simulation code. Using a convolution neural network, we separate quasars from stars and galaxies. We measure the redshifts by identifying the strong emission lines of quasars. We also fit the 1D slitless spectra with QSOFITMORE to estimate the black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy can effectively separate quasars with redshifts $z=0-5$ from other types of objects with an accuracy of 99\%. Among those successfully classified quasars, 90\% of them could have precise redshift measurements with $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}=0.002$. The scatters of black hole masses and Eddington ratios from the spectral fittings are 0.13 and 0.15 dex, respectively. The metallicity diagnosis line ratios have a scatter of 0.1-0.2 dex. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy survey has the potential to discover about 0.9 million new quasars and provide important contributions to AGN science and cosmology.

  X-ray observations of the optically selected $z=6.025$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520 (hereafter J1641) revealed that its flux dropped by a factor $\gtrsim7$ from 2018, when it was a bright and soft X-ray source, to 2021. Such a strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among $z&gt;6$ QSOs, and the underlying physical mechanism was unclear. We carried out a new X-ray and rest-frame UV monitoring campaign of J1641 over 2022-2024. We detected J1641 with Chandra in the 2-7 keV band, while no significant emission is detected at softer X-ray energies, making J1641 an X-ray changing look QSO at $z&gt;6$. Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically by a factor $&gt;20$. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing, obscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018 and 2021. The screening material could be an inner disk or a failed nuclear wind that increased their thickness. Another possibility is that we have witnessed an occultation event due to dust-free clouds located at sub-pc/pc scales, similar to those recently invoked to explain the remarkable X-ray weakness of AGN discovered by JWST. These interpretations are also consistent with the lack of strong variations of the QSO rest-frame UV lightcurve over the same period. Future monitoring of J1641 and the possible discovery of other X-ray changing look QSOs at $z&gt;6$ will provide us with precious information about the physics of rapid supermassive black-hole growth at high redshift.

  We investigate the relationship between AGN optical variability timescales, amplitudes, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses using homogeneous light curves from the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). We fit a damped random walk (DRW) model to high-cadence, long-baseline ASAS-SN light curves to estimate the characteristic variability timescale ($\tau_\text{DRW}$) and amplitude ($\sigma$) for 57 AGN with precise SMBH mass measurements from reverberation mapping and dynamical methods. We confirm a significant correlation between $\tau_\text{DRW}$ and SMBH mass, and find: $\text{log}_{10}(M_\text{BH}/ \text{M}_\odot) = (1.85\pm0.20)\times\text{log}_{10} (\tau_\text{DRW}/200 \text{ days})+7.59\pm0.08$. Incorporating $\hat{\sigma}^2 = 2\sigma^2/\tau_\text{DRW}$ in a plane model significantly improves residuals, and we find: $\text{log}_{10}(M_\text{BH}/ \text{M}_\odot) = (2.27\pm0.20)\times\text{log}_{10} (\tau_\text{DRW}/200\text{ days})+(1.20\pm0.20)\times\text{log}_{10}(\hat{\sigma}/\text{1 mJy/days}^{1/2})+7.68\pm0.08$ with a scatter of 0.39 dex. We calculate $\tau_\text{DRW}$, $\hat{\sigma}$, and estimate SMBH masses for 203 bright ($V&lt;16$ mag) AGN from the Milliquas catalog and compare these estimates with measurements from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey for 42 overlapping AGN. In 10 years, LSST could extend this method to survey $7\lesssim\text{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\lesssim9$ SMBHs out to $z\sim1$ and $\textrm{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\sim8.0$ out to $z\sim4$, and ASAS-SN could probe $5\lesssim \textrm{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\lesssim10.5$ SMBHs in the local universe and $\textrm{log}_{10}({M_\text{BH}/M_\odot})\sim9.0$ out to $z\sim2$. Measuring AGN variability with these datasets will provide a unique probe of SMBH evolution by making estimates of $M_\text{BH}$ spanning several orders of magnitude with photometric observations alone.

  Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin$^{2}$ across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at $z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}$, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{UV}$=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H$\alpha$ emission (rest-frame EW $2810\pm550$\AA); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope $\beta=-2.34\pm0.36$); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H$\beta$&lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of $\simeq10^{5}M_{\odot}$. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at $z=4-10$, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 ($\approx10^{-4}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.
