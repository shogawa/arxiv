  Investigating whether and how galaxy mergers affect black hole growth can be determinant for black hole-galaxy evolution models and, in particular, for understanding how early Universe seed black holes grew to become supermassive. However, while mergers have been observed to enhance the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and thus black hole growth in massive galaxies, it is yet not known how this relation and the role of the environment translates to dwarf galaxies (the most likely hosts of the early seed black holes), since there are scarce and mixed results in the literature. We want to assess the impact of galaxy mergers and the environment on AGN triggering in dwarf galaxies. We use a sample of 3280 dwarf galaxies with integral-field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey to study the AGN fraction throughout the merger process and how it is affected by the environment (characterized by galaxy isolation, being in a void, and group richness). We also compare the fraction of interacting galaxies in AGN and non-AGN dwarf galaxies. We find that dwarf galaxy mergers can ignite AGNs at separations below 20 kpc. The AGN fraction increases notoriously after the first pass and remains enhanced until the final stage. Despite this, mergers are not the dominant AGN triggering mechanism. We also find that the environment has a non-negligible impact on AGN activity in dwarf galaxies, as the AGN fraction increases when moving to lower density environments. These findings provide the most statistically robust constraints to date on the effects of dwarf galaxy mergers and environment on AGN activity and black hole growth.

  The scale invariance of accretion processes (SIAP) is crucial for understanding the physical processes of black hole accretion systems at different scales. When applying this rule to high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs), there is an observation-theory confrontation in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By compiling an updated X-ray HFQPO catalog, we found that the ultraluminous X-ray sources support the HFQPO models, similar to black hole X-ray binaries. More importantly, we identified two supermassive black hole (SMBH) sources (Sgr A and NGC 1365) with possible advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) configurations that support existing HFQPO models, even though many AGNs still do not. Furthermore, we report a new HFQPO candidate in NGC 5506. This source exhibits an accretion state similar to that of Sgr A* and NGC 1365, and it also supports the HFQPO models. Our results are consistent with previous numerical simulations and suggest that the accretion state of HFQPOs in SMBHs may differ from that of stellar-mass black holes (SBHs). To reconcile the sources that do not support the models, either a global general-relativistic HFQPO model based on magnetohydrodynamics needs to be considered, or the HFQPOs in these sources may originate from entirely different physical processes. This discovery significantly extends the SIAP rule to a broader scale, confirming that the paradigm of accretion scale invariance remains consistent from SBHs to SMBHs.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) significantly influence galaxy evolution. Specific sources such as obscured AGNs, especially Type II quasars (QSO2), still remain understudied. We characterise 366 QSO2 candidates in the redshift desert (median z~1.1) identified via machine learning from SDSS/WISE photometry, analysing their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and deriving their physical properties. Using CIGALE, we estimated star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M), AGN luminosity, and AGN fraction. We compared these with SPRITZ simulations and the literature, placing results in the galaxy evolution context. Our QSO2 candidates show diverse evolutionary stages. The SFR-M diagram reveals high-SFR sources above the main sequence, linking AGN activity to enhanced star formation. Quenched galaxies may indicate obscured star formation or AGN feedback. Additionally, the physical properties align with SPRITZ composite systems and AGN2, endorsing our obscured AGN classification. This study validates machine learning for identifying AGN-host galaxies, beyond traditional colour-colour selections. Diverse candidate properties highlight this method's ability to identify complex AGN systems. This advances our understanding of AGN-driven galaxy evolution with new target selection.

  The origin of He II emission in galaxies remains a debated topic, requiring ionizing photons with energies exceeding 54 eV. While massive stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars, have been considered potential sources, their UV flux often fails to fully explain the observed He II emission. Recent studies suggest that X-ray binaries (XRBs) might contribute significantly to this ionization. We explore the relationship between X-ray and $\rm He~II \lambda4686$ emission in a statistically significant sample of galaxies, investigating whether X-ray sources, including active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and XRBs, serve as the primary mechanism for He II ionization across different galactic environments. We cross-matched a sample of known well-detected He II galaxies with the Chandra Source Catalog, yielding 165 galaxies with X-ray and $\rm He~II \lambda4686$ detections. The sources were classified into star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and AGNs based on the BPT diagram and a classification scheme defined for He II galaxies. We find a strong, linear correlation between X-ray and He II luminosity across AGNs and SFGs spanning over seven orders of magnitude. AGNs generally exhibit higher He II\H$\beta$ flux ratios, stronger extinction, and harder X-ray spectra. The O32 ratio of SFGs is tightly correlated with the H$\beta$ equivalent width ($\rm EW_{H\beta}$) but not with the He II/H$\beta$ ratio, suggesting a different excitation mechanism. We derive an O32--$\rm EW_{H\beta}$ line above which only AGNs of our sample reside. The tight correlation between X-ray and He II luminosity supports X-rays as the primary driver of He II excitation. While AGNs have one common ionization source, the central black hole, in SFGs low-energy species are mainly excited by UV emission related to star-forming activity, however, high-energy species like He II require the presence of XRBs.

  The cosmic star formation history (CSFH) and cosmic active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history (CAGNH) are self consistently presented at $z = 5.5-13.5$. This is achieved by analyzing galaxies detected by the James Webb Space Telescope from $\approx 400 \, \mathrm{arcmin^{2}}$ fields from the PEARLS, CEERS, NGDEEP, JADES and PRIMER surveys. In particular, the combination of spectral energy distribution fitting codes, EAZY and ProSpect, are employed to estimate the photometric redshifts and astrophysical quantities of 3947 distant galaxies, from which we compute the stellar mass, star formation rate and AGN luminosity distribution functions in four redshift bins. Integrating the distribution functions, we find that the CAGNH tentatively rises by $\approx 2.2$ dex over $z = 5.5-13.5$ compared to $\approx 1.8$ dex for the CSFH, indicating that the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) tends to outpace the assembly of stellar mass. We connect our results of the CSFH and CAGNH at $z=5.5-13.5$ to that from $z= 0-5$ to determine the summary of $\gtrsim 13$ Gyr of star formation and AGN activity, from the very onset of galaxy formation to the present day.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are some of the most luminous and extreme environments in the Universe. The central engines of AGN, believed to be super-massive black-holes, are fed by accretion discs threaded by magnetic fields within a dense magneto-ionic medium. We report our findings from polarimetric Very-long-baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar NRAO150 taken in October 2022 using a combined network of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope. These observations are the first co-temporal multi-frequency polarimetric VLBI observations of NRAO150 at frequencies above 15GHz. We use the new VLBI polarization calibration procedure, GPCAL, with polarization observations of frequencies of 12GHz, 15GHz, 24GHz, and 43GHz of NRAO150. From these observations, we measure Faraday rotation. Using our measurement of Faraday rotation, we also derive the intrinsic electric vector position angle (EVPA0) for the source. As a complementary measurement we determine the behavior of polarization as a function of observed frequency. The polarization from NRAO150 only comes from the core region, with a peak polarization intensity occurring at 24GHz. Across the core region of NRAO150 we see clear gradients in Faraday rotation and EVPA0 values that are aligned with the direction of the jet curving around the core region. We find that for the majority of the polarized region the polarization fraction is greater at higher frequencies, with intrinsic polarization fractions in the core 3%. The Faraday rotation gradients and circular patterns in EVPA0 are strong evidence for a helical/toroidal magnetic field, and the presence of low intrinsic polarization fractions indicate that the polarized emission and hence the helical/toroidal magnetic field, occur within the innermost jet.

  We measure the luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) of photometric satellite galaxies around spectroscopically identified isolated central galaxies (ICGs). The photometric satellites are from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR9), while the spectroscopic ICGs are selected from the DESI Year-1 BGS sample. We can measure satellite LFs down to $r$-band absolute magnitudes of $M_{r,\mathrm{sat}}\sim-7$, around ICGs as small as $7.1&lt;\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;7.8$, with the stellar mass of ICGs measured by the DESI Fastspecfit pipeline. The satellite SMF can be measured down to $\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{sat}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}\sim 5.5$. Interestingly, we discover that the faint/low-mass end slopes of satellite LFs/SMFs become steeper with the decrease in the stellar masses of host ICGs, with smaller and nearby host ICGs capable of being used to probe their fainter satellites.. The steepest slopes are $-2.298\pm0.656$ and $-$2.888$\pm$0.916 for satellite LF and SMF, respectively. Detailed comparisons are performed between the satellite LFs around ICGs selected from DESI BGS or from the SDSS NYU-VAGC spectroscopic Main galaxies over $7.1&lt;\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;11.7$, showing reasonable agreements, but we show that the differences between DESI and SDSS stellar masses for ICGs play a role to affect the results. We also compare measurements based on DESI Fastspecfit and Cigale stellar masses used to bin ICGs, with the latter including the modeling of AGN based on WISE photometry, and we find good agreements in the measured satellite LFs by using either of the DESI stellar mass catalogs.

  With the advent of GRAVITY+, the upgrade to the beam combiner GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), fainter and higher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are becoming observable, opening an unprecedented opportunity to further our understanding of the cosmic coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. To identify an initial sample of high-redshift type~1 AGNs that can be observed with GRAVITY+, we have obtained spectroscopic data with NTT/SOFI of the most promising candidates. Our goal is to measure their broad line region (BLR) fluxes and assess their physical geometries by analysing the spectral profiles of their Balmer lines. We present 29 $z$ $\sim$ 2 targets with strong H$\alpha$ emission in the $K$-band. Their line profiles are strongly non-Gaussian, with a narrow core and broad wings. This can be explained as a combination of rotation and turbulence contributing to the total profile or two physically distinct inner and outer regions. We find small H$\alpha$ virial factors, which we attribute to the low full-width-half-maximum (FWHM)/$\sigma$ ratios of their non-Gaussian profiles, noting that this can lead to discrepancies in black hole masses derived from scaling relations. We also find two targets that show tentative evidence of BLRs dominated by radial motions. Lastly, we estimate the expected differential phase signals that will be seen with GRAVITY+, which will provide guidance for the observing strategy that will be adopted.
