  It is widely accepted that X-ray emission in luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) originates from hot corona. To prevent the corona from over-cooling by strong X-ray emission, steady heating to the corona is essential, for which the most promising mechanisms is the magnetic reconnection. Detailed studies of the coupled disc and corona, in the frame of magnetic field transferring accretion-released energy from the disc to the corona, reveal that the thermal electrons can only produce X-ray spectrum with $\Gamma_{\rm 2-10\,keV}&gt;2.1$, which is an inevitable consequence of the radiative coupling of the thermal corona and disc. In the present work, we develop the magnetic-reconnection-heated corona model by taking into account the potential non-thermal electrons accelerated in the magnetic reconnection process, in addition to the thermal electrons. We show that the features of the structure and spectrum of the coupled disc and corona can be affected by the fraction of magnetic energy allocated to thermal electrons. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of the power-law index and energy range of non-thermal electrons and the magnetic field on the spectrum. It is found that the X-ray spectrum from the Comptonization of the hybrid electrons can be flatter than that from thermal electrons only, in agreement with observations. By comparing with the observed hard X-ray data, we suggest that a large fraction ($&gt;40\%$) of the magnetic energy be allocated to the non-thermal electrons in the luminous and flat X-ray spectrum AGNs.
