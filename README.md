  Most active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the center of the nearby galaxies have super-massive black holes accreting at sub-Eddington rates through hot accretion flows or radiatively inefficient accretion flows, which efficiently produce jets. The association of radio and X-ray flares with the knot ejection from M81* inspires us to model its multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution during these flares to constrain the physical parameters of the jet. Moreover, we construct a long-term light curve in X-rays to identify the flares in the available data and constrain the jet parameters during those periods. The jet activity may vary on short and long time scales, which may produce flares in different frequency bands. The spectral energy distributions from radio to X-ray during the quiescent as well as flaring states are found to be satisfactorily explained by synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons from a single zone. The variation in the values of the jet parameters during the different states is shown and compared with high synchrotron peaked blazars.

  Relativistic jets launched by Active Galactic Nuclei are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. The emission over the entire electromagnetic spectrum of these relativistic jets can be extremely variable with scales of variability from less than few minutes up to several years. These variability patterns, which can be very complex, contain information about the acceleration processes of the particles and the area(s) of emission. Thanks to its sensitivity, five-to twenty-times better than the current generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes depending on energy, the Cherenkov Telescope Array will be able to follow the emission from these objects with a very accurate time sampling and over a wide spectral coverage from 20 GeV to &gt; 20 TeV and thus reveal the nature of the acceleration processes at work in these objects. We will show the first results of our lightcurve simulations and long-term behavior of AGN as will be observed by CTA, based on state-of-art particle acceleration models.

  We analysed the nuclear region of all 56 early-type galaxies from the DIVING$^\mathrm{3D}$ Project, which is a statistically complete sample of objects that contains all 170 galaxies of the Southern Hemisphere with B &lt; 12.0 mag and galactic latitude |b| &lt; 15$^{\circ}$. Observations were performed with the Integral Field Unit of the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. Emission lines were detected in the nucleus of 86$\pm$5% of the objects. Diagnostic diagrams were used to classify 52$\pm$7% of the objects as LINERs or Seyferts, while the other 34$\pm$6% galaxies without H$\beta$ or [O III] lines in their spectra were classified as weak emission line objects. Transition Objects are not seen in the sample, possibly because the seeing-limited data cubes of the objects allow one to isolate the nuclei of the galaxies from their circumnuclear regions, avoiding contamination from H II regions. A broad line region is seen in 29$\pm$6% of the galaxies. Of the 48 galaxies with emission-line nuclei, 41 have signs of AGNs. Some objects have also indications of shocks in their nuclei. Lenticular galaxies are more likely to have emission lines than ellipticals. Also, more luminous objects have higher [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios, which may be associated with the mass-metalicity relation of galaxies. A direct comparison of our results with the Palomar Survey indicates that the detection rates of emission lines and also of type 1 AGNs are higher in the DIVING$^\mathrm{3D}$ objects. This is a consequence of using a more modern instrument with a better spatial resolution than the Palomar Survey observations.

  We present a detailed analysis of the point spread function (PSF) of JWST NIRCam imaging in eight filters: F070W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W, and F480M, using publicly available data. Spatial variations in the PSF FWHM generally decrease with wavelength: the maximum and RMS fractional variations are $\sim20\%$ and $5\%$ in F070W, reduced to $\sim3\%$ and $0.6\%$ in F444W. We compare three commonly-used methods (SWarp, photutils, and PSFEx) to construct model PSFs and conclude that PSFEx delivers the best performance. Using simulated images of broad-line AGNs, we evaluate the impact of PSF mismatches on the recoverability of host galaxy properties. Host fluxes are generally overestimated when adopting mismatched PSF models, with larger overestimation for more AGN-dominated systems. Broader PSFs tend to produce less concentrated hosts while narrower PSFs tend to produce more concentrated and compact hosts. Systematic uncertainties in host measurements from PSF and model mismatches are generally larger than the formal fitting uncertainties for high signal-to-noise ratio data. Image decomposition can also lead to an artificial offset between the AGN and host centroids, which is common (e.g., $&gt;1\sigma$ [$3\sigma$] detection in $\sim 80%$ [$\sim 20-30\%$] of systems), and scales with the mean host surface brightness. Near the surface brightness limit, this artificial offset can reach as large as $\sim80\%$, $26\%$, and $7\%$ of $R_e$ in systems with $R_e=$0.12", 0.48", and 1.92", respectively. We demonstrate our PSF construction and image decomposition methods with an example broad-line quasar at $z=1.646$ in the CEERS field.

  Radio used as a star formation rate (SFR) tracer presents enormous advantages by being unaffected by dust and radio sources being pinpointed at the sub-arc-second level. The interpretation of the low frequency 1.4 GHz luminosity is hampered by the difficulty in modeling the cosmic ray paths in the interstellar medium, and their interactions with the magnetic field. In this work, we compare the SFR derived from radio observations, and the ones derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. We aim at better understand the behavior of the SFR radio tracer, with a specific emphasis on the link with star-formation histories. We used the SED modeling code Code Investigating GALaxy Emission, CIGALE, with a non-parametric star formation history model (SFH) and fit the data over the wavelength range from the ultraviolet (UV) up to the mid-infrared (mid-IR). We interpret the difference between radio and SED-based SFR tracers in the light of recent gradients in the derived SFH. To validate the robustness of the results, we checked for any remaining active galaxy nuclei (AGN) contribution and tested the impact of our SFH modeling approach. Approximately 27% our galaxies present a radio SFR (SFR$_{\rm radio}$) at least ten times larger than the instantaneous SFR from SED-fitting (SFR$_{\rm SED}$). This trend affects primarily the galaxies that show a declining SFH activity over the last 300 Myr. Both SFR indicators converge toward a consistent value, when the SFHs are averaged over a period larger than 150 Myr to derive SFR$_{\rm SED}$. Although the radio at low frequency 1.4 GHz is a good tracer of the star formation activity of galaxies with constant or increasing SFH, our results indicate that this is not the case for galaxies that are quenching. Our analysis suggests that the star formation time sensitivity of the radio low frequency could be longer than 150 Myr.

  In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\rm H} &lt; 10^{22}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \leq N_{\rm H} &lt; 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\rm p}(r_{\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host dark matter halo, $M_{\rm halo}(z, N_{\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\log M_{\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\odot]$ ($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \sim 0.7$ (high $z \sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.

  Imaging in radioastronomy is an ill-posed inverse problem. Particularly the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration faces two big limitations for the existing methods when imaging the active galactic nuclei (AGN): large and expensive surveys solving the problem with different optimization parameters must be done, and only one local minima for each instance is returned. With our novel nonconvex, multiobjective optimization modeling approach, we aim to overcome these limitations. To this end we used a multiobjective version of the genetic algorithm (GA): the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition, or MOEA/D. GA strategies explore the objective function by evolutionary operations to find the different local minima, and to avoid getting trapped in saddle points. First, we have tested our algorithm (MOEA/D) using synthetic data based on the 2017 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array and a possible EHT + next-generation EHT (ngEHT) configuration. We successfully recover a fully evolved Pareto front of non-dominated solutions for these examples. The Pareto front divides into clusters of image morphologies representing the full set of locally optimal solutions. We discuss approaches to find the most natural guess among these solutions and demonstrate its performance on synthetic data. Finally, we apply MOEA/D to observations of the black hole shadow in Messier 87 (M87) with the EHT data in 2017. MOEA/D is very flexible, faster than any other Bayesian method and explores more solutions than Regularized Maximum Likelihood methods (RML). We have done two papers to present this new algorithm: the first explains the basic idea behind multi-objective optimization and MOEA/D and it is used to recover static images, while in the second paper we extend the algorithm to allow dynamic and (static and dynamic) polarimetric reconstructions.
