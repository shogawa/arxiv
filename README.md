  Recent James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have discovered galaxies that are already passively evolving at $z&gt;4$, $\sim1.5$\,Gyr after the Big Bang. Remarkably, some of these galaxies exhibit strong emission lines such as \ha\ and \oiii\ while showing a strong continuum break at $\sim3650$\,\AA\ i.e., Balmer break, giving us a unique insight into the physical mechanisms responsible for early galaxy quenching. In this study, we investigate the nature of four such galaxies at $z=5.10$--$5.78$ identified in the Abell~2744 field, using JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis reveals that these galaxies have been mostly quiescent since $\sim100$\,Myr prior to the observed time. We find a higher dust attenuation in the nebular component than in the continuum in all cases. This suggests the presence of dusty star-forming regions or obscured AGN, which could be a {\it residual} signature of past quenching. For one of the galaxies with sufficient medium-band coverage, we derive the \hb+\oiii\ emission line map, finding that the line-emitting region is located in the center and is more compact ($R_e=0.7$\,kpc) than the stellar component ($R_e=0.9$\,kpc). For this specific galaxy, we discuss a scenario where quenching proceeds in the manner of ``outside-in", a stark contrast to the inside-out quenching commonly seen in massive galaxies at later cosmic times.

  The thermodynamic evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is driven by a complex interplay between gravitational collapse, radiative cooling, and baryonic feedback associated with galaxy formation. Using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of a group of mass $8.83 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and a cluster of mass $2.92 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ at $z=0$, we investigate the emergence of entropy plateaus at characteristic halo masses and their connection to feedback mechanisms. We use the SWIFT-EAGLE model with three resolution levels, down to an initial particle gas mass of $2.29 \times 10^5$ M$_\odot$ and dark matter particle mass of $1.23 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$. Our analysis reveals that when halos reach $\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, their entropy profiles flatten at the virial radius, marking a transition where AGN feedback begins to dominate over supernova-driven regulation. By tracking the Lagrangian history of gas particles, we demonstrate that this entropy buildup is driven primarily by AGN feedback, which efficiently removes low-entropy gas from progenitors of groups and clusters, redistributing it throughout the IGM before the gas can fall into the core region. Recent XMM-Newton observations of X-GAP local groups reveal large entropy excesses and flat cores, in line with our predicted plateaus and in contrast to the steeper, power-law-like profiles of previous observations. While these predicted plateaus may be observationally confirmed in unbiased samples, reproducing the full diversity of entropy profiles, from flat cores to cool-core power laws, remains an outstanding challenge for next-generation feedback models. We suggest that current AGN feedback models may be overly efficient in expelling low-entropy gas from the potential cool-core $10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ progenitors, disrupting the balance between heating and cooling required to sustain long-lived cool cores.

  The accretion disks that power active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to house populations of stars and compact objects; after forming binaries these compact objects may merge, begetting gravitational waves such as those detected by LIGO and VIRGO. We present a comprehensive study of the early evolution of binaries within AGN disks as their orbits are influenced by the surrounding gas, focusing on eccentric and unequal-mass binaries. Nearly-equal-mass binaries behave similarly to their equal-mass counterparts: prograde binaries inspiral, albeit somewhat slowly, and have their eccentricities damped; retrograde binaries inspiral $\sim2-3$ times faster than their prograde counterparts, and those with near-equal masses are driven quickly towards near-unity eccentricities. However, the primaries in retrograde binaries with mass ratios of $m_2/m_1\lesssim0.4$ experience significantly weaker headwinds and retain substantial accretion disks that help damp binary eccentricities, slowing binary inspirals. Additionally, we find that while accretion drives prograde binaries towards equal masses thanks to the exchange of material between the primary and secondary accretion disks, retrograde binaries are driven slowly towards more extreme mass ratios. Prograde binaries, and generally those with low mass ratios, likely accrete for multiple $e$-folding timescales before merger. On the other hand, high-mass-ratio retrograde binaries may merge before accreting substantially, potentially approaching merger with detectable eccentricity. Future ground-based gravitational wave observatories, with their broader frequency coverage, should be particularly useful for studying these populations.   

The Emergence of Little Red Dots from Binary Massive Black Holes

  Little red dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a distinctive v-shape spectrum characterized by red optical and blue UV continuum emission. Their high abundance at redshifts of $z\sim6-8$ and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin. We propose that the spectral shape of LRDs originates from compact binary black hole systems, where each black hole is surrounded by a mini-disk and embedded in a larger circum-binary disk. With a binary separation of $\lesssim 10^3$ Schwarzschild radii, the Wien tail of a $T\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$ blackbody spectrum at the inner edge of the circum-binary disk produces the red optical emission, while the mini-disks power the UV continuum. Binary torques carve out a gap between the circum-binary disk and mini-disks, setting the turnover wavelength of the v-shaped spectrum around the Balmer limit. This scenario naturally reproduces LRD spectra requiring only modest dust attenuation ($A_V\lesssim 1$ mag), resolving overestimated luminosities for LRDs in previous studies and alleviating a tension with the so-called Soltan argument. This model predicts a distinct spectral evolution as the binary orbit decays through binary-disk interactions and gravitational waves (GWs), linking early-stage "proto-LRD" binaries to the broader AGN population and late-stage "LRD-descendants" to coalescing binaries detectable in GW experiments.

  We dissect the kinematics and morphology of the molecular gas within the near-nuclear region of NGC 1068 to understand the mechanisms in the central AGN that might be fueling it, and the impact of its energy output on the surrounding molecular gas. We present high angular and spectral resolution ALMA observations of the HCO$^+$4-&gt;3 and CO 3-&gt;2 molecular lines in the near-nuclear region of the prototype Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. The spatial resolution (1.1~pc) is almost two times better than that of previous works studying the same molecular lines at the same transitions and is the highest resolution achievable with ALMA at these frequencies. Our analysis focuses on moment maps, position-velocity (PV) diagrams, and spectra obtained at the position of the nuclear continuum source, along with a simple kinematic model developed using the 3DBarolo software. Our observations reveal significant asymmetry between the eastern and western sides of the nuclear disc in terms of morphology, velocity, and line intensity. The broad lines seen in the inner 2 pc could be accounted for by either beam smearing or highly turbulent gas in this region. Outside this radius the mean velocities drop to $\pm$30 km/s, which cannot be explained by asymmetric drift. We find low velocity connections extending to 13 pc suggesting interactions with larger scale structures. The CO/HCO$^+$ line ratio at the nucleus reported here are extremely low compared to values in the literature of the same galaxy at lower spatial resolutions.

  One of the most remarkable results from the \emph{James Webb Space Telescope} has been the discovery of a large population of compact sources exhibiting strong broad H$\alpha$ emission, typically interpreted to be low-luminosity broad-line (Type 1) active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). An important question is whether these observations are in tension with galaxy formation models, and if so how? While comparisons have been made using physical properties (i.e.~black hole mass and accretion rate) inferred from observations, these require the use of SED modelling assumptions, or locally inferred scaling relations, which may be unjustified, at least in the distant high-redshift Universe. In this work we take an alternative approach and forward model predictions from the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations to predict the observable properties of BLAGN. We achieve this by first coupling \flares\ with the \qsosed\ model to predict the ionising photon luminosities of high-redshift ($z&gt;5$) AGN. To model the observed broad H$\alpha$ emission we then assume a constant conversion factor and covering fraction, and the fraction of AGN that have observable broad-lines. With a reasonable choice of these parameters, \flares\ is able to reproduce observational constraints on the H$\alpha$ luminosity function and equivalent width distribution at $z=5$.

  We report on Chandra X-ray observations of four narrow-line quasar candidates at z~6, selected from the SHELLQs project, based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. These objects are characterised by narrow (FWHM&lt;310 km/s), luminous (&gt;1e44 erg/s) Lya and faint UV continuum (M_1450 = -22 - -21), prompting us to examine whether they are obscured luminous AGN at the epoch of reionization. However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving an upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2 sigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical spectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion paper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the scaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of these sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the Chandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent of JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to the broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter which also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion disc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission, could be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies at high redshifts. Alternatively, the same effect could be obtained from an inflated disc at the innermost radii in a supercritical accretion flow, when the disc is viewed at inclined angles.

  The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at $z &gt; 6$, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over $&gt;$1000 deg$^2$, and were known to have luminous ($&gt;10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that nine of them exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration ($0 &lt; A_V &lt; 3$) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses $10^{7.8 - 9.1} M_\odot$, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to "little red dots" with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly$\alpha$ emitters to be larger than $2 \times 10^{-8}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.

  Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come from different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical objects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by nearby objects (self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\tau$ for the main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\rm GW}\sim (1-10^3)\,{\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters, the probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low ($\tau\simeq10^{-7}$), even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant interactions ($\tau\simeq 10^{-5}$). Additionally, the lensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can reach $\tau\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH or BBHs formed as GW captures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster, likely eccentric. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the migration trap of an AGN (active galactic nucleus) disk, $\tau \simeq 10^{-2}$. The imprint of these massive lenses are two images that are easily detectable already in current detectors. Moreover, AGN disk merger signals have a distinct linear $h_+$ polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the detectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\rm max}$, which can increase for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of BBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform signatures such as eccentricity and polarization.
