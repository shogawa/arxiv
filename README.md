  Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) are known to change their spectral type between 1 and 2 (changing-state) or change their absorption between Compton-thick and Compton-thin (changing-obscuration) on timescales of years or less. The physical mechanism and possible connection between the two types of CLAGNs are still unclear. We explore the evolution of the broadband X-ray spectra from Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (\nustar\,) and column density in five CLAGNs with moderate inclination viewing angles, which have shown significant variations of both optical types and X-ray absorption. Based on a phenomenological and two clumpy torus models, we find that the X-ray photon index ($\Gamma$) and the Eddington-scaled X-ray $2-10$ keV luminosity ($L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$) are positively correlated for the five sources, which are similar to other bright AGNs and optical CLAGNs at type 1 phase. We find a significant negative correlation between log$N_\mathrm{H,los}$ and log$L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ except for ESO 362-G18. Similar to changing-state AGNs, changing-obscuration AGNs may be also triggered by the evolution of the accretion disc. Our results support the disc wind scenario, where the disc wind proportional to the accretion rate and formed at moderate inclination angles would push the obscuration material further away and decrease the column density from the line of sight observed in the changing-look AGNs.

  We explore spectroscopic and photometric methods for identifying high-redshift galaxies containing an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) with JWST observations. After demonstrating the limitations of standard optical methods, which appear ineffective in the low-metallicity environment of the early universe, we evaluate alternative diagnostic techniques using the current JWST observational capabilities. Our analysis focuses on line ratios and equivalent widths (EWs) of UV emission lines: CIV, HeII $\lambda$1640, OIII] $\lambda$1665, and CIII], and the faint optical line, HeII $\lambda$4686. We find that the most valuable diagnostic quantities for finding AGN are the line ratios: (CIII] + CIV) / HeII $\lambda$1640 and CIII] / HeII $\lambda$1640, as well as the EW of HeII $\lambda$1640. For more reliable AGN identification, the HeII $\lambda$1640 and OIII] $\lambda$1665 lines would need to be detected separately. We show that the HeII $\lambda$1640/H$\beta$ ratio effectively separates AGN from star-forming galaxies, though it is contingent on a low dust content. We also show that in order to effectively use these diagnostics, future observations require longer exposure times, especially for galaxies at $z &gt; 6$. Subsequently, we plot three real high-redshift sources on these diagrams which present strong UV emission lines. However, in order to classify them as strong AGN candidates, further study is needed due to the blending of HeII + OIII] and unreliable optical lines. Lastly, we carry out a selection process using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with EAZY to identify strong AGN candidates in the JADES NIRCam photometry. One galaxy in our sample emerged as a strong AGN candidate, supported by both photometric selection and strong UV emission. We present a sample of similar AGN candidates in the JADES data based on this method.

  The origin of the correlation between the effective spins ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) and mass ratios ($q$) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's binary black holes (BBHs) is still an open question. Motivated by recent identification of two subpopulations of the BBHs, in this work we investigate the potential $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ correlation for each subpopulation. Surprisingly, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation vanishes for the low-mass subpopulation if we introduce a second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution for the high-mass subpopulation likely originating from hierarchical mergers. The first subpopulation has a narrow $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution peaking at $\sim0.05$, whose primary-mass function cuts off at $\sim 45M_{\odot}$, in agreement with first-generation BBHs. The second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution is broad and peaks at $\mu_{\chi,2}=0.35^{+0.18}_{-0.22}$, consistent with the expectation of hierarchical mergers formed in the disks of active galactic nucleus (AGNs). We infer $\mu_{\chi,2}&gt;0$ at 98.7\% credible level, and a symmetric $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution for the second subpopulation is disfavored by $\mathcal{B}\sim5$. However, negative values of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ are also measured, indicating that the hierarchical mergers may take place within both star clusters and AGN disks. We find a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B}=5.2$ for two distinct $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distributions relative to single $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution that conditioned on mass ratios. Therefore we conclude that the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation in the entire population can be explained as the superposition of two subpopulations. Additionally, we suggest to use a flexible mass function to reduce the bias in $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation that may be introduced by model mis-specification.

  We present an extensive temporal and spectral study of the Seyfert 1 AGN Mrk 50 using 15 years (2007-2022) of multiwavelength observations from XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR for the first time. From the timing analysis, we found that the source exhibited variability of $\sim$20 % during the 2007 observation, which reduced to below 10 % in the subsequent observations and became non-variable in the observations from 2010 onward. From the spectral study, we found that the spectra are nearly featureless. Non-detection of absorption in the low-energy domain during the 15 years of observation infers the absence of obscuration around the central engine, rendering the nucleus a `bare' type. A prominent soft X-ray excess below 2 keV was detected in the source spectrum during the observations between 2007 and 2010, which vanished during the later observations. To describe the nature of the soft excess, we use two physical models, such as warm Comptonization and blurred reflection from the ionized accretion disk. Both the physical models explain the nature and origin of the soft excess in this source. Our analysis found that Mrk~50 accretes at sub-Eddington accretion rate ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.13-0.02$) during all the observations used in this work.

  Ultra-soft narrow line Seyfert 1 (US-NLSy) are a poorly observed class of active galactic nuclei characterized by significant flux changes and an extreme soft X-ray excess. This peculiar spectral shape represents a golden opportunity to test whether the standard framework commonly adopted for modelling local AGN is still valid. We thus present the results on the joint XMM-Newton and HST monitoring campaign of the highly accreting US-NLSy RBS 1332. The optical-to-UV spectrum of RBS 1332 exhibits evidence of both a stratified narrow-line region and an ionized outflow, that produces absorption troughs over a wide range of velocities (from ~1500 km s-1 to ~1700 km s-1) in several high-ionization transitions (Lyalpha, N V, C IV). From a spectroscopic point of view, the optical/UV/FUV/X-rays emission of this source is due to the superposition of three distinct components which are best modelled in the context of the two-coronae framework in which the radiation of RBS 1332 can be ascribed to a standard outer disk, a warm Comptonization region and a soft coronal continuum. The present dataset is not compatible with a pure relativistic reflection scenario. Finally, the adoption of the novel model reXcor allowed us to determine that the soft X-ray excess in RBS 1332 is dominated by the emission of the optically thick and warm Comptonizing medium, and only marginal contribution is expected from relativistic reflection from a lamppost-like corona.
