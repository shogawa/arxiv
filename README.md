  Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei (CL AGN) exhibit drastic variations in broad emission lines (BELs), the mechanism of which remains unclear. Expanding the sample of CL AGN is helpful to reveal the mechanism. This study aims to identify more CL AGNs by cross-matching spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). Our approach to identify CL AGN candidates is based on the automatic spectral fitting, followed by detailed visual inspections. Through this method, we present a sample of 88 CL AGNs, in which 77 sources being newly discovered. Within this sample, 59 CL AGNs primarily show the variability of the H$\beta$ line, 22 exhibit changes in both the H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ lines, and 7 mainly display variations in the H$\alpha$ line. Our findings reveal that the sequence of appearance and disappearance of the BELs aligns with the known CL sequence. We estimate the black hole mass and Eddington ratio for these CL AGNs, which range from $2.5\times 10^6$ to $8.0\times 10^8 M_\odot$ and from 0.001 to 0.13, respectively. The Eddington ratio is lower than that of most typical AGNs, and is consistent with the results of previous studies on CL AGN. Our results support the hypothesis that the CL behavior is driven by the state transitions of the accretion disk.

  The ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) puzzle is reviewed under the hints of a few basic results: clustering, anisotropy, asymmetry, bending, and composition changes with energies. We show how the lightest UHECR nuclei from the nearest AGN or Star-Burst sources, located inside a few Mpc Local Sheets, may explain, at best, the observed clustering of Hot Spots at tens EeV energy. Among the possible local extragalactic candidate sources, we derived the main contribution of very few galactic sources. These are located in the Local Sheet plane within a distance of a few Mpc, ejecting UHECR at a few tens of EeV energy. UHECR also shine at lower energies of several EeV, partially feeding the Auger dipole by LMC and possibly a few nearer galactic sources. For the very recent highest energy UHECR event, if a nucleon, it may be explained by a model based on the scattering of UHE ZeV neutrinos on low-mass relic neutrinos. Such scatterings are capable of correlating, via Z boson resonance, the most distant cosmic sources above the GZK bound with such an enigmatic UHECR event. Otherwise, these extreme events, if made by the heaviest composition, could originate from the largest bending trajectory of heaviest nuclei or from nearby sources, even galactic ones. In summary, the present lightest to heavy nuclei model UHECR from the Local Sheet could successfully correlate UHECR clustering with the nearest galaxies and AGN. Heavy UHECR may shine by being widely deflected from the Local Sheet or from past galactic, GRB, or SGR explosive ejection.

  The First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH) is a large-area radio survey for neutral hydrogen in the redshift range 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.0, using the 21cm HI absorption line as a probe of cold neutral gas. FLASH uses the ASKAP radio telescope and is the first large 21cm absorption survey to be carried out without any optical preselection of targets. We use an automated Bayesian line-finding tool to search through large datasets and assign a statistical significance to potential line detections. The survey aims to explore the neutral gas content of galaxies at a cosmic epoch where almost no HI data are currently available, and to investigate the role of neutral gas in AGN fuelling and feedback. Two Pilot Surveys, covering around 3000 deg$^2$ of sky, were carried out in 2019-22 to test and verify the strategy for the full FLASH survey. The processed data from these Pilot Surveys (spectral-line cubes, continuum images, and catalogues) are available online. Here, we describe the FLASH spectral-line and continuum data and discuss the quality of the HI spectra and the completeness of our automated line search. Finally, we present a set of 30 new HI absorption lines that were robustly detected in the Pilot Surveys. These lines span a wide range in HI optical depth, including three lines with a peak optical depth $\tau&gt;1$, and appear to be a mixture of intervening and associated systems. The overall detection rate for HI absorption lines in the Pilot Surveys (0.3 to 0.5 lines per ASKAP field) is a factor of two below the expected value. There are several possible reasons for this, but one likely factor is the presence of a range of spectral-line artefacts in the Pilot Survey data that have now been mitigated and are not expected to recur in the full FLASH survey. A future paper will discuss the host galaxies of the HI absorption systems identified here.

  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), both from merger of binary compact objects (short GRBs) and collapse of massive stars (long GRBs), are expected to occur in the dense environments, e.g., the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The propagating of GRB jets in such dense environment will result in multiband transients. Investigating the properties of these transients plays important roles in their identification, understanding the jet structure and constraining population of the star and compact object in AGN disks. In this work, we intend to study the propagation and emission of a two-component GRB jet (a fast narrow component and wide slow one) in the AGN disk. We consider the influence of wind from the short and long GRB progenitors, which would reconstruct the surrounding density distribution and form a cavity in the AGN disk. We find that the long GRB jets will be chocked, the dynamcis and the emission are resemble to the case without cavity. The narrow and wide cocoon breakout emission can be detected by EP and HXMT, respectively. For short GRBs, we expect a non-thermal afterglow emission from the wide jet and a cocoon breakout emission from the chocked narrow jet, which can be monitored by EP and HXMT, respectively. Therefore, the joint observations by EP and HXMT might be helpful to distinguish the type of GRBs in the AGN disk and the jet components.

  Using stacked emission line flux measurements of cool circumgalactic gas (CGM) in lower-mass galaxies ($10^{9.0} \le M_*/M_\odot \le 10^{10.2} $), we measure the dependence of the emission characteristics on orientation relative to the disk plane as a function of radius and compare to that we found previously for massive ($M_* &gt; 10^{10.4} M_\odot$) early-type galaxies. Although the line ratios (the lower [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [O III]/H$\beta$) suggest an overall softer ionizing source than in the more massive galaxies, consistent with previous findings, we find the same ionization hardening signature (a higher [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratio in the inner polar region) along the polar direction at small radii that we found for the more massive galaxies. The line ratio in the inner polar bin is distinct from that measured for the inner planar bin with 99.99% confidence and with $&gt;$ 99.9% confidence we conclude that it lies outside the star formation regime. The effective hardening of the ionization of the CGM along the polar axis, at small radii, could either indicate relic effects of AGN activity or shock ionization. In either case, this signature appears to be ubiquitous across the stellar mass range we are able to explore with our spectral stacking technique and currently available archival data.
