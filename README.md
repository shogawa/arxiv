  We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization ($z\gtrsim6-8$), high redshift AGN ($z\gtrsim6$), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies ($1\lesssim z \lesssim 6$), and filler galaxies sampling redshift--color--magnitude space from $z\sim 0.1-13$. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin$^2$, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to $m_{\mathrm{F444W}}\sim30\mathrm{AB}$, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of $M_{\mathrm{SL}}=(2.1\pm0.3)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).

  Wide-separation lensed quasars (WSLQs) are a rare class of strongly lensed quasars, magnified by foreground massive galaxy clusters, with typically large magnifications of the multiple quasar images. They are a relatively unexplored opportunity for detailed study of quasar host galaxies. The current small sample of known WSLQs has a median redshift of $z\approx 2.1$, larger than most other samples of quasar host galaxies studied to date. Here, we derive precise constraints on the properties of six WSLQs and their host galaxies, using parametric surface brightness fitting, measurements of quasar emission lines, and stellar population synthesis of host galaxies in six WSLQ systems. Our results, with significant uncertainty, indicate that these six hosts are a mixture of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. To probe for co-evolution between AGNs and host galaxies, we model the offset from the `local' ($z=0$) $M_{\rm{BH}}\unicode{x2013}M_\star$ relation as a simple power-law in redshift. Accounting for selection effects, a WSLQ-based model for evolution in the $M_{\rm{BH}}\unicode{x2013}M_\star$ relation has a power-law index of $\gamma_M=-0.42\pm0.31$, consistent with no evolution. Compared to several literature samples, which mostly probe unlensed quasars at $z&lt;2$, the WSLQ sample shows less evolution from the local relation, at $\sim 4\sigma$. We find that selection affects and choices of $M_{\rm{BH}}$ calibration are the most important systematics in these comparisons. Given that we resolve host galaxy flux confidently even from the ground in some instances, our work demonstrates that WSLQs and highly magnified AGNs are exceptional systems for future AGN$\unicode{x2013}$host co-evolution studies.

  We study, from both a theoretical and observational perspective, the physical origin and spectroscopic impact of extreme nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies. The nebular continuum, which can appear during extreme starbursts, is of particular importance as it tends to redden UV slopes and has a significant contribution to the UV luminosities of galaxies. Furthermore, its shape can be used to infer the gas density and temperature of the ISM. First, we provide a theoretical background, showing how different stellar populations (SPS models, IMFs, and stellar temperatures) and nebular conditions impact observed galaxy spectra. We demonstrate that, for systems with strong nebular continuum emission, 1) UV fluxes can increase by up to 0.7~magnitudes (or more in the case of hot/massive stars) above the stellar continuum, which may help reconcile the surprising abundance of bright high-redshift galaxies and the elevated UV luminosity density at $z&gt;10$, 2) at high gas densities, UV slopes can redden from $\beta\lesssim-2.5$ to $\beta\sim-1$, 3) observational measurements of $\xi_{ion}$ are grossly underestimated, and 4) UV downturns from two-photon emission can masquerade as DLAs. Second, we present a dataset of 58 galaxies observed with NIRSpec on JWST at $2.5&lt;z&lt;9.0$ that are selected to have strong nebular continuum emission via the detection of the Balmer jump. Five of the 58 spectra are consistent with being dominated by nebular emission, exhibiting both a Balmer jump and a UV downturn consistent with two-photon emission. For some galaxies, this may imply the presence of hot massive stars and a top-heavy IMF. We conclude by exploring the properties of spectroscopically confirmed $z&gt;10$ galaxies, finding that UV slopes and UV downturns are in some cases redder or steeper than expected from SPS models, which may hint at more exotic (e.g. hotter/more massive stars or AGN) ionizing sources.
