  Previous X-ray works on Mrk 1239 have revealed a complex Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) that exhibits substantial absorption and strong emission from both collisional (CIE) and photoionized (PIE) plasmas. Here, we report on deep-pointed observations with $XMM{\rm -}Newton$ and $NuSTAR$, along with $Swift$ monitoring, to understand the $0.3-30$ keV continuum emission and the central engine geometry. A strong X-ray flare, where the AGN brightens by a factor of five in $\sim30$ ks, is captured between $4-30$ keV and can be attributed to a brightening of the primary continuum. However, the lack of any variability below $\sim3$ keV on long- or short-time scales requires complete absorption of the AGN continuum with a neutral medium of column density $\sim 10^{23.5}{\rm cm}^{-2}$. The timing and spectral properties are consistent with a blurred reflection interpretation for the primary emission. The variability and presence of a Compton hump disfavours ionized partial covering. The neutral absorber, if outflowing, could be crashing into the surrounding medium and ISM to produce the low-energy continuum and CIE. Scattered emission off the inner torus could produce the PIE. The intricate scenario is demanded by the data and highlights the complexity of the environment that is normally invisible when overwhelmed by the AGN continuum. Objects like Mrk 1239 serve as important sources for unveiling the interface between the AGN and host galaxy environments.

  We study the impact of black hole nuclear activity on both the global and radial star formation rate (SFR) profiles in X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the field of miniJPAS, the precursor of the much wider J-PAS project. Our sample includes 32 AGN with z &lt; 0.3 detected via the XMM-Newton and Chandra surveys. For comparison, we assembled a control sample of 71 star-forming (SF) galaxies with similar magnitudes, sizes, and redshifts.   To derive the global properties of both the AGN and the control SF sample, we used CIGALE to fit the spectral energy distributions derived from the 56 narrowband and 4 broadband filters from miniJPAS. We find that AGN tend to reside in more massive galaxies than their SF counterparts. After matching samples based on stellar mass and comparing their SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs), no significant differences appear. This suggests that the presence of AGN does not strongly influence overall star formation.   However, when we used miniJPAS as an integral field unit (IFU) to dissect galaxies along their position angle, a different picture emerges. We find that AGN tend to be more centrally concentrated in mass with respect to SF galaxies. Moreover, we find a suppression of the sSFR up to 1Re and then an enhancement beyond 1Re , strongly contrasting with the decreasing radial profile of sSFRs in SF galaxies. This could point to an inside-out quenching of AGN host galaxies. These findings suggest that the reason we do not see differences on a global scale is because star formation is suppressed in the central regions and enhanced in the outer regions of AGN host galaxies. While limited in terms of sample size, this work highlights the potential of the upcoming J-PAS as a wide-field low-resolution IFU for thousands of nearby galaxies and AGN.
