  Interaction of plasma flow with a magnetic obstacles is a frequent process in many laser-plasma experiments in the laboratory, and is an important event in many astrophysical objects: X-ray pulsars, AGN, GRB etc. As a result of plasma penetration through the magnetic wall we could expect a formation of MHD shock waves, as well as of electromagnetic ones. To study these processes we need equations following from hydrodynamic and Maxwell equations, which in the limiting situations describe MHD and EM waves, and are valid for the general case, when both phenomena are present. Here we derive a set of equations following from HD and Maxwell equation, without neglecting a displacement current, needed for a formation of EM waves. We find a dispersion equation describing a propagation of a weak linear wave in a magnetized plasma along the $x$ axis, perpendicular to the magnetic field $H_z(x)$, which contains MHD, HD and EM waves in the limiting cases, and some new types of behaviour in a general situation. We consider a plasma with zero viscosity and heat conductivity, but with a finite electro-conductivity with a scalar coefficient.

  The AGN STORM 2 campaign is a large, multiwavelength reverberation mapping project designed to trace out the structure of Mrk 817 from the inner accretion disk to the broad emission line region and out to the dusty torus. As part of this campaign, Swift performed daily monitoring of Mrk 817 for approximately 15 months, obtaining observations in X-rays and six UV/optical filters. The X-ray monitoring shows that Mrk 817 was in a significantly fainter state than in previous observations, with only a brief flare where it reached prior flux levels. The X-ray spectrum is heavily obscured. The UV/optical light curves show significant variability throughout the campaign and are well correlated with one another, but uncorrelated with the X-rays. Combining the Swift UV/optical light curves with Hubble UV continuum light curves, we measure interband continuum lags, $\tau(\lambda)$, that increase with increasing wavelength roughly following $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$, the dependence expected for a geometrically thin, optically thick, centrally illuminated disk. Modeling of the light curves reveals a period at the beginning of the campaign where the response of the continuum is suppressed compared to later in the light curve - the light curves are not simple shifted and scaled versions of each other. The interval of suppressed response corresponds to a period of high UV line and X-ray absorption, and reduced emission line variability amplitudes. We suggest that this indicates a significant contribution to the continuum from the broad line region gas that sees an absorbed ionizing continuum.

  PSO J334.2028+1.4075 (PSO J334) is a luminous quasar located at redshift z=2.06. The source gained attention when periodic flux density variations were discovered in its optical light curve. These variations were initially interpreted as the variability due to the orbital motion of a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) residing in a single circumbinary accretion disk. However, subsequent multiwavelength observations provided evidence against the binary hypothesis as no optical periodicity was found on extended time baselines. On the other hand, detailed radio analysis with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) revealed a lobe-dominated quasar at kpc scales, and possibly a precessing jet, which could retain PSO J334 as a binary SMBH candidate. We aim to study both the large- and small-scale radio structures in PSO J334 to provide additional evidence for or against the binary scenario. We observed the source at 1.7 GHz with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN), and at 1.5 and 6.2 GHz with the VLA, at frequencies that complement the previous radio interferometric study. Our images reveal a single component at parsec scales slightly resolved in the southeast-northwest direction and a lobe-dominated quasar at kiloparsec scales with a complex structure. The source morphology and polarization in our VLA maps suggest that the jet is interacting with dense clumps of the ambient medium. While we also observe a misalignment between the inner jet and the outer lobes, we suggest that this is due to the restarted nature of the radio jet activity and the possible presence of a warped accretion disk rather than due to the perturbing effects of a companion SMBH. Our analysis suggests that PSO J334 is most likely a jetted AGN with a single SMBH, and there is no clear evidence of a binary SMBH system in its central engine.

  We analyze the optical power spectral density (PSD) for 22 active galactic nuclei (AGN) with measured X-ray PSDs using light curves from the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The joint optical PSD is measured over up to six orders of magnitude in frequency space from timescales of minutes to a decade. We fit either a damped random walk (DRW) or a broken power law model to constrain the PSD model and break frequency. For the broken power-law fits to the joint PSDs, we find a high-frequency timescale which is proportional to both the X-ray timescales and the black hole masses, but the optical timescale is 2.7 dex longer. Assuming the optical and X-ray breaks are related by a physical process, such as reprocessing of X-ray emission, the break frequency difference interpreted as a light crossing time is consistent with the expected size difference between the optical and X-ray emission regions. On timescales of months to a decade, we also measured a correlation between the low-frequency optical break timescales and the X-ray break timescales, but with a much shallower slope. The DRW model provides acceptable fits and we generally confirm previously reported correlations between the DRW timescales and the black hole mass.
