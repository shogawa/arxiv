  Blazars, the peculiar class of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are known to show flux variations across the accessible electromagnetic spectrum. Though they have been studied extensively for their flux variability characteristics across wavelengths, information on their ultraviolet (UV) flux variations on time scales of hours is very limited. Here, we present the first UV flux variability study on intraday time scales of a sample of 10 blazars comprising 2 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 8 BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs). These objects, spanning a redshift (z) range of 0.034 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.003, were observed in the far-UV (FUV: 1300 - 1800 \text{\AA}) and near-UV (NUV: 2000 - 3000 \text{\AA}) wavebands using the ultraviolet imaging telescope on board AstroSat. UV flux variations on time scales of hours were detected in 9 sources out of the observed 10 blazars. The spectral variability analysis showed a bluer-when-brighter trend with no difference in the UV spectral variability behavior between the studied sample of FSRQs and BL Lacs. The observed UV flux and spectral variability in our sample of both FSRQs and BL Lacs revealed that the observed UV emission in them is dominated by jet synchrotron process.

  Despite the increasing prevalence of RL sources at cosmic noon, our understanding of the underlying physics that governs the accretion disc outflows in these particular sources and its dissimilarity with RQ quasars remains somewhat limited. Disentangling the real impact of the radio-loudness and accretion on the outflow parameters remains a challenge to this day. We present 10 new spectra of high-z high-L quasars, combined with previous data at both high and low z and evaluate the role of the feedback from RL and RQ AGN. The final high-z high-L sample consists of a combination of 60 quasars from our ISAAC and the Hamburg-ESO surveys. The low-z sample has 84 quasars with optical and FOS reanalyzed data. We perform a multicomponent analysis of optical and UV emission line profiles along the quasar MS, and provide a relation to estimate the outflow main parameters in both the BLR and NLR through the analysis of the [OIII]5007 and CIV1549 emission lines. High-ionization lines usually present a significant asymmetry towards the blue especially in RQ that is strong evidence of outflow motions. In the ISAAC sample, 72% of the quasars present significant O[III] outflows, with c(1/2) ~ -250 km/s. RL tend to present slightly more modest blueshifted components. The behavior of [OIII]5007 mirrors the one of CIV1549, with blueshift amplitudes between the two lines showing a high degree of correlation that appears unaffected by the presence of radio emission. Both RL and RQ AGN outflow parameters at high L appear in the range needed to provide feedback effects on their host galaxies. Both high- and low-z RL quasars exhibit smaller outflows compared to RQ, suggesting a potential role of radioloudness in mitigating outflow effects. Nevertheless, the radio-loudness effect on the AGN feedback is much less significant than the one of accretion that emerges as the main driver of the nuclear outflows.

  We use the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of the radio loud AGN host UGC 8782 to map the warm molecular and ionized gas kinematics. The data reveal outflows in the inner 2 kpc, seen in low ionization (traced by the [Ar ii] 6.99 um emission) and in warm molecular gas (traced by the H2 rotational transitions), observed for the first time in an AGN host. We find a maximum mass-outflow rate of 4.90(2.04) M/yr at ~900 pc from the nucleus for the warm outflow (198 K&lt;T&lt;1000 K) and estimate and outflow rate of up to 1.22(0.51) M/yr for the hotter gas phase (T &gt; 1000 K). These outflows can clear the entire nuclear reservoir of warm molecular gas in about 1 Myr. The derived kinetic power of the molecular outflows lead to coupling efficiencies of 2-5 percent of the AGN luminosity, way above the minimum expected to the AGN feedback be effective quenching the star formation

  It is currently established that the sources contributing to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) emission are mainly nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), in particular those that are obscured. Thus, it is important to fully identify the hard X-ray sky source population to accurately characterize the individual contribution of different AGNs to the overall CXB emission. We present a follow-up analysis of all the 218 sources marked as unidentified in our previous revision of the third release of the Palermo Swift-BAT hard X-ray catalog (3PBC) based on our multifrequency classification scheme. These 218 sources were classified as unidentified in our previous analyses because they lack an assigned low-energy counterpart. We searched for soft X-ray counterparts of these 218 3PBC sources in archival Swift-XRT observations obtained between 2005 January 1st and 2018 August 1st. In particular, we found 1213 archival Swift-XRT observations for 192 of the 218 unidentified sources. We found 93 possible Swift-XRT counterparts inside of the Swift-BAT positional uncertainty regions. These correspond to 73 3PBC sources, where 60 have only a single Swift-XRT detection, and 13 sources have multiple detections. We present a catalog of all the detected possible counterparts of the yet unidentified hard X-ray sources to the community as a catalog for future spectroscopic follow-up targets, together with a short catalog of our classification of the ten sources for which we found available spectra.
