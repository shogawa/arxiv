  Observations and theoretical simulations suggest that the large scale environment plays a significant role in how galaxies form and evolve and, in particular, whether and when galaxies host an actively accreting supermassive black hole in their center (i.e., an Active Galactic Nucleus, or AGN). One signature of AGN activity is luminosity variability, which appears in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) when circumnuclear dust reprocesses UV and optical photons from the AGN accretion disk. We present here a suite of constraints on the fraction of AGN activity in the most underdense regions of the universe (cosmic voids) relative to the rest of the universe (cosmic walls) by using ~12 years of combined multi-epoch data from AllWISE and NEOWISE to quantify mid-IR variability. We find clear evidence for a larger mid-IR variability-AGN fraction among high and moderate-luminosity void galaxies compared to their wall counterparts. We also show that mid-IR variability identifies a rather large and unique population of AGNs, the majority of which have eluded detection using more traditional AGN-selection methods such as single-epoch mid-IR color selection. The fraction of these newly-recovered AGNs is larger among galaxies in voids, suggesting once again more prolific AGN activity in the most underdense large scale structures of the universe.

  Far-infrared (FIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) fine-structure lines (FSLs) are widely used for studying galaxies nearby and faraway. However, interpreting these lines is complicated by factors including sample and data bias, mismatch between resolved calibrations and unresolved observations, limitations in generalizing from case studies, and unresolved issues like the origin of [C II] emission and the so-called ``deficit.''In this series of papers, we assemble and analyze the most comprehensive atlas of FSL data to date. We explore their empirical correlations (paper I), compare them with photoionization models that cover multiphase gas (paper II), and discuss their physical origins and the new perspectives they offer for studying physical properties (paper III). The first paper introduces value-added catalogs of global FSL data of low- and high-z galaxies compiled from the literature, covering most of the existing observations, supplemented with ancillary ultraviolet to FIR information. Our analysis focus on commonly used diagnostics, such as electron density, radiation field strength, metallicity, and electron temperature. We present their distributions across different galaxy samples and redshifts, and cross-validate the reliability of these diagnostics in measuring physical conditions. By examining empirical relations, we identify the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) to the FIR FSLs [O III]88 and [O I]63, and reveal a bias in density measurements. FIR FSLs show good concordance with their optical counterparts. Our findings indicate that variations in FSL ratios are primarily driven by the relative abundances of emitting ions, underscoring their value as tracers of metallicity and radiation field strength. Finally, we compare the FIR FSL properties of low- and high-z galaxies, discussing both their similarities and differences.

  We use the narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line detected in the recently published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes in their centers. Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line emission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly complete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z &gt; 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order L_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems is Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH&gt;10^7 M_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated from dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied BH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably higher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the general trend seen in some other z &gt; 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the [Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection of the [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line at z &gt; 5 would translate to similarly high AGN luminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for studying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured sources.

  We present a detailed analysis of the most luminous and obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) detected in the ultra-hard X-ray band (14-195 keV) by Swift/BAT. Our sample comprises 21 X-ray luminous (log $L_X/{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}&gt;44.6$, 2-10 keV) AGNs at $z&lt;0.6$, optically classified as Seyfert 1.9-2. Using NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and Chandra, we constrain AGN properties such as absorption column density $N_H$, photon index $\Gamma$, intrinsic $L_X$, covering factor, and iron K$\alpha$ equivalent width. For sources with black hole mass estimates (12/20), we find a weak correlation between $\Gamma$ and Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$). Of these, six ($50\pm13\%$) lie in the $N_H$-$\lambda_{Edd}$ "forbidden region'' and exhibit a combined higher prevalence of $N_H$ variability and outflow signatures, suggesting a transitional phase where AGN feedback may be clearing the obscuring material. For the 13/21 sources with multi-epoch X-ray spectra, $82^{+6}_{-16}\%$ exhibit variability in either 2-10 keV flux ($73^{+9}_{-16}\%$) or line-of-sight $N_H$ ($33^{+15}_{-10}\%$). For the 20/21 sources with available near-UV/optical spectroscopy, we detect [NeV]$\lambda$3426 in 17 ($85^{+5}_{-11}\%$), confirming its reliability to probe AGN emission even in heavily obscured systems. When normalized to the same [OIII]$\lambda$5007 peak flux as $z = 2$-$9$ narrow-line AGNs identified with JWST, our sample exhibits significantly stronger [NeV]$\lambda$3426 emission, suggesting that high-redshift obscured AGNs may be intrinsically weaker in [NeV]$\lambda$3426 or that [NeV]$\lambda$3426 is more challenging to detect in those environments. The sources presented here serve as a benchmark for high-redshift analogs, showing the potential of [NeV]$\lambda$3426 to reveal obscured AGNs and the need for future missions to expand X-ray studies into the high-redshift Universe.

  We build upon FEGA25 (Contini et al 2025), a previously introduced semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative (suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation), we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25 is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR, YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas ejection in halos with logM_{halo} &lt; approximately 12, while AGN feedback becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model, which activates primarily at late times, redshift &lt; 1, reproduces a characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in intermediate halo mass regimes.

  JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift "little red dots" (LRDs) that challenge conventional AGN models. We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1-0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$\alpha$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed "The Egg"), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, Fe II, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.
