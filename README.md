  The James Webb Space Telescope has detected massive black holes (BHs) with masses of $\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$ within the first billion years of the universe. One of the remarkable findings is the identification of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), a unique class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with distinct characteristics representing a key phase in the formation and growth of early BHs. Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around redshifts $z \sim 6-8$ and sharply decline at $z &lt; 4$. We find that this trend follows a log-normal distribution, commonly observed in phenomena driven by stochastic and random factors. We propose a hypothesis that the first one or two AGN events associated with newly-formed seed BHs are observed as LRDs and their unique features fade in the subsequent episodes. This naturally explains the cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over $0 &lt; z &lt; 5$, which follows $\propto (1+z)^{-5/2}$ due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity. The unique characteristics of LRDs are likely linked to the dense gas environments around the seed BHs, which create strong absorption features in the broad-line emission and enable super-Eddington accretion bursts, ultimately yielding the observed overmassive nature of BHs compared to the local relationship.

  The X-ray quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) is a remarkable form of variability in systems of compact object accretion. RE J1034+396, harboring the most significant X-ray QPO in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), is the most noteworthy source for in-depth analysis of AGN X-ray QPO properties. A long-term evolution of its QPO has been observed over the course of the observations. However, the short-term variability of its QPO properties remains unexplored within each observation that has long good time intervals (GTIs). We collect 12 XMM-Newton observations of RE J1034+396 with GTIs longer than 60 ks from publicly available data and conduct a detailed wavelet analysis focusing on the short-time modulation of the QPO. The QPO signals are found to undergo amplitude modulation in both the soft and hard bands, with a typical timescale of 17 ks. The soft flux is significantly higher when the hard QPO is present. They are highly correlated, with an average cross-correlation function (CCF) peak coefficient of 0.61 and a lag of approximately 3 ks. This novel finding provides fresh insights into the potential connection between the components of the corona emitting soft and hard X-ray photons. The CCF lag between the soft flux and the hard QPO evolves across the observations, potentially sharing the same origin as the previously observed interconnected evolution between QPO frequency and time lag.

  Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be surrounded by a collisionless, highly magnetized accretion flow. As a result, Particle-in-Cell simulations are the best tools to study the immediate vicinity of the event horizons of these supermassive black holes. We present a GPU-based general relativistic particle-in-cell (GRPIC) code framework called Aperture. Aperture is developed in C++, with compute kernels written in CUDA and HIP to take advantage of the massive acceleration modern GPUs enable. The code is organized in a fully modular way, allowing easy extensions to new physics problems. In this paper, we describe in detail the particle pusher, field solver, and charge-conserving current deposition algorithms employed in Aperture, and present test cases to validate their correctness. Then, we apply the code to study spark gaps and plasma injection in black hole magnetospheres. We find that the apparent location and time-evolution of the gap depend on the observer. Our results reconcile the previous conflicting findings from 1D and 2D simulations in the literature.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts of $z\gtrsim 4-7$, many of which host accreting massive black holes (BHs) with BH-to-galaxy mass ($M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$) ratios exceeding the local values by more than an order of magnitude. The origin of these overmassive BHs remains unclear but requires potential contributions from heavy seeds and/or episodes of super-Eddington accretion. We present a growth model coupled with dark matter halo assembly to explore the evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$ ratio under different seeding and feedback scenarios. Given the gas inflow rates in protogalaxies, BHs grow episodically at moderate super-Eddington rates and the mass ratio increases early on, despite significant mass loss through feedback. Regardless of seeding mechanisms, the mass ratio converges to a universal value $\sim 0.1-0.3$, set by the balance between gas feeding and star formation efficiency in the nucleus. This behavior defines an attractor in the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ diagram, where overmassive BHs grow more slowly than their hosts, while undermassive seeds experience rapid growth before aligning with the attractor. We derive an analytical expression for the universal mass ratio, linking it to feedback strength and halo growth. The convergence of evolutionary tracks erases seeding information from the mass ratio by $z\sim 4-6$. Detecting BHs with $\sim 10^{5-6}~M_\odot$ at higher redshifts that deviate from convergence trend would provide key diagnostics of their birth conditions.

  We measure H$\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) at redshifts $z \sim 4.5$ and 6.3 using the JWST MAGNIF (Medium-band Astrophysics with the Grism of NIRCam In Frontier fields) survey. MAGNIF obtained NIRCam grism spectra with the F360M and F480M filters in four Frontier Fields. We identify 248 H$\alpha$ emitters based on the grism spectra and photometric redshifts from combined HST and JWST imaging data. The numbers of the H$\alpha$ emitters show a large field-to-field variation, highlighting the necessity of multiple fields to mitigate cosmic variance. We calculate both observed and dust-corrected H$\alpha$ LFs in the two redshift bins. Thanks to the gravitational lensing, the measured H$\alpha$ LFs span three orders of magnitude in luminosity, and the faint-end luminosity reaches $L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} \sim 10^{40.3} \mathrm{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at $z \sim 4.5$ and $10^{41.5} \mathrm{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at $z \sim 6.3$, corresponding to star-formation rates (SFRs) of $\sim$ 0.1 and 1.7 $\mathrm{M}_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. We conclude no or weak redshift evolution of the faint-end slope of H$\alpha$ LF across $z\simeq0.4-6.3$, and the comparison with the faint-end slopes of UV LF indicates stochastic star formation history among low-mass H$\alpha$ emitters. The derived cosmic SFR densities are $0.058^{+0.008}_{-0.006}\ \ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \sim 4.5$ and $0.025^{+0.009}_{-0.007}\ \ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \sim 6.3$. These are approximately 2.2 times higher than previous estimates based on dust-corrected UV LFs, but consistent with recent measurements from infrared surveys. We discuss uncertainties in the H$\alpha$ LF measurements, including those propagate from the lens models, cosmic variance, and AGN contribution.

  Galaxies are often modelled as composites of separable components with distinct spectral signatures, implying that different wavelength ranges are only weakly correlated. They are not. We present a data-driven model which exploits subtle correlations between physical processes to accurately predict infrared (IR) WISE photometry from a neural summary of optical SDSS spectra. The model achieves accuracies of $\chi^2_N \approx 1$ for all photometric bands in WISE, as well as good colors. We are also able to tightly constrain typically IR-derived properties, e.g. the bolometric luminosities of AGN and dust parameters such as $\mathrm{q_{PAH}}$. We find that current SED-fitting methods are incapable of making comparable predictions, and that model misspecification often leads to correlated biases in star-formation rates and AGN luminosities. To help improve SED models, we determine what features of the optical spectrum are responsible for our improved predictions, and identify several lines (CaII, SrII, FeI, [OII] and H$\alpha$), which point to the complex chronology of star formation and chemical enrichment being incorrectly modelled.
