  Large-scale magnetic fields in the nuclear regions of protogalaxies can trigger the formation and early growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by direct collapse and boosted accretion. Turbulence associated with gravitational infall and star formation can drive the rms field strength toward equipartition with the mean gas kinetic energy; this field has a generic tendency to self-organize into large, coherent structures. If the poloidal component of the field (relative to the rotational axis of a star-forming disc) becomes organized on scales $\lesssim r$ and attains an energy of order a few percent of the turbulent energy in the disc, then dynamo effects are expected to generate magnetic torques capable of boosting the inflow speed and thickening the disk. The accretion flow can transport matter toward the center of mass at a rate adequate to create and grow a massive direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seed and fuel the subsequent AGN at a high rate, without becoming gravitationally unstable. Fragmentation and star formation are thus suppressed and do not necessarily deplete the mass supply for the accretion flow, in contrast to prevailing models for growing and fueling SMBHs through disc accretion.

  As one of the drivers of feedback in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the jets launched from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are important for understanding the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. However, the formation of AGN jets is far from clear. The discovery of $\gamma$-ray narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies during the past two decades has provided us with a new means of studying the link between jets and accretion processes and the formation of jets. Here, we explore the coupling of jet and accretion discs in seven bright $\gamma$-ray NLS1 galaxies by studying simultaneous optical/ultraviolet and X-ray observations of these systems taken by Swift. The results show that, except for 1H 0323+342 in which the X-rays are significantly contributed from the accretion disc, the observed X-ray emission of the other sources is dominated by the jet, and accretion process makes little contribution if not absent. Although the origin of the X-ray emission is different, the broad-band spectral shape characterized by $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ and the X-ray flux is found to follow the same evolutionary trend in 1H 0323+342, PMN J0948+0022, and PKS 1502+036. For the remaining sources, the trend is not observed or the sampling is not dense enough.
