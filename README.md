  In the context of an evolutionary model, the outflow phase of an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) occurs at the peak of its activity, once the central SMBH is massive enough to generate sufficient power to counterbalance the potential well of the host galaxy. This phase plays a vital role in galaxy evolution. We aim to apply various selection methods to isolate powerful AGNs in the feedback phase, trace and characterise their outflows, and explore the link between AGN luminosity and outflow properties. We applied a combination of methods to the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth survey (eFEDS) catalogue and isolated ~1400 candidates at z&gt;0.5 out of ~11750 AGNs (~12\%). We tested the robustness of our selection on the small subsample of 50 sources with available good quality SDSS spectra at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1, for which we fitted the [OIII] emission line complex and searched for the presence of ionised gas outflows. We identified 23 quasars (~45\%) with evidence of ionised outflows based on the presence of significant broad and shifted components in the [OIII] line. They are on average more luminous and more obscured than the parent sample, although this may be ascribed to selection effects affecting the good quality SDSS spectra sample. By adding 118 outflowing quasars at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3.5 from the literature, we find a weak correlation between the maximum outflow velocity and AGN bolometric luminosity. On the contrary, we find strong correlations between mass outflow rate and outflow kinetic power with the AGN bolometric luminosity. About 30\% of our sample have kinetic coupling efficiencies &gt;1\%. We find that the majority of the outflows have momentum flux ratios lower than 20 which rules out an energy-conserving nature. Our present work points to the unequivocal existence of a rather short AGN outflow phase, paving the way towards a new avenue to dissect AGN outflows in large samples within eROSITA and beyond.

  Recent models for the inner structure of active galactic nuclei (AGN) aim at connecting the outer region of the accretion disk with the broad-line region and dusty torus through a radiatively accelerated, dusty outflow. Such an outflow not only requires the outer disk to be dusty and so predicts disk sizes beyond the self-gravity limit but requires the presence of nuclear dust with favourable properties. Here we investigate a large sample of type 1 AGN with near-infrared (near-IR) cross-dispersed spectroscopy with the aim to constrain the astrochemistry, location and geometry of the nuclear hot dust region. Assuming thermal equilibrium for optically thin dust, we derive the luminosity-based dust radius for different grain properties using our measurement of the temperature. We combine our results with independent dust radius measurements from reverberation mapping and interferometry and show that large dust grains that can provide the necessary opacity for the outflow are ubiquitous in AGN. Using our estimates of the dust covering factor, we investigate the dust geometry using the effects of the accretion disk anisotropy. A flared disk-like structure for the hot dust is favoured. Finally, we discuss the implication of our results for the dust radius-luminosity plane.   

The link between star-formation and supermassive black hole properties

  It is well known that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies co-evolve. AGN feedback plays an important role on this symbiosis. To study the effect of the AGN feedback on the host galaxy, a popular method is to study the star-formation rate (SFR) as a function of the X-ray luminosity (L$_X$). However, hydrodynamical simulations suggest that the cumulative impact of AGN feedback on a galaxy is encapsulated in the mass of the SMBH, M$_{BH}$, rather than the L$_X$. In this study, we compare the SFR of AGN and non-AGN galaxies as a function of L$_X$, M$_{BH}$, Eddington ratio (n$_{Edd}$) and specific black hole accretion rate ($\lambda _{sBHAR}$). For that purpose, we use 122 X-ray AGN in the XMM-XXL field and 3371 galaxies from the VIPERS survey and calculate the SFR$_{norm}$ parameter, defined as the ratio of the SFR of AGN to the SFR of non-AGN galaxies with similar stellar mass, M$_*$, and redshift. Our datasets span a redshift range of $\rm 0.5\leq z\leq 1.2$. The results show that the correlation between SFR$_{norm}$ and M$_{BH}$ is stronger compared to that between SFR$_{norm}$ and L$_X$. A weaker correlation is found between SFR$_{norm}$ and $\lambda _{sBHAR}$. No correlation is detected between SFR$_{norm}$ and n$_{Edd}$. These results corroborate the idea that the M$_{BH}$ is a more robust tracer of the cumulative impact of the AGN feedback compared to the instantaneous accretion rate (L$_X$) and, thus, a better predictive parameter of the changes of the SFR of the host galaxy.
