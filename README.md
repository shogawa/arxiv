  Supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies gain mass through accretion disks. Models predict that quasi-spherical winds, expelled by the black hole during active accretion phases, have a key role in shaping galaxy evolution by regulating star formation, the distribution of metals over kiloparsec scales, and by sweeping ambient gas to the outskirts and beyond of galaxies. Nonetheless, the mechanism driving these outflows and the amount of energy exchanged between the wind and the galaxy's interstellar medium remain unclear. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the kinematical properties of winds in a sample of nearby active galaxies using the novel kinematic tool MOKA3D, which takes into account the clumpy nature of the ISM. We find remarkable similarities among the properties of the outflows in all the galaxies examined. In particular, we provide the first evidence that outflows exhibit a regular trend in radial velocity, initially constant or slightly decreasing, followed by rapid acceleration starting at approximately 1 kpc from the nucleus, despite the seemingly complex kinematics observed. The observed behavior aligns with our current theoretical understanding of Active Galactic Nuclei outflows, where a momentum-driven phase transitions to an energy-conserving phase just beyond approximately 1 kpc. The constant velocity of the momentum-driven wind is then rapidly accelerated following the inefficient Compton cooling of post-shock material and the transition to energy conservation. The measured radial terminal velocities of the outflows are always larger than the escape velocities from the host galaxies, confirming the key role of outflows in shaping the galaxy properties and evolution, as a manifestation of AGN feedback. Our results, only made possible by our novel kinematic analysis tool, are crucial to understand the origin and the powering mechanism of these winds.

  We use the ASTRID cosmological simulation to forecast massive black hole (MBH) binary mergers detectable by LISA. A key result is a significant increase in the predicted detection rate when MBH orbital eccentricity is included, rising from 5.6 for circular orbits to 10.5 events per year. This boost is largely due to inspiral sources that will merge after LISA's mission period, which make up 46% of detections in the eccentric case. This highlights LISA's sensitivity to early inspiral phases, especially for eccentric binaries that emit across a wider frequency band. Most LISA detections arise from $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{5-6}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, low-redshift ($z&lt;2$), low mass-ratio ($q\sim 0.01$--$0.1$) mergers, complementing instruments like Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Eccentricity also expands the detectable MBH mass range to $10^9~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ (from $10^8~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and shifts the redshift peak from $z = 1.9$ (circular) to $z = 0.8$ (eccentric). We find LISA will detect MBH mergers in diverse host galaxies, including lower-mass and satellite galaxies. These hosts are $\sim 50$ times more star-forming than typical galaxies of the same mass, forming a tight power-law in SFR--$M_{\rm gal}$ space: ${\rm SFR} = 10^{-8} M_{\rm gal}^{0.9}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, independent of redshift. This contrasts with expectations for PTA sources, which tend to reside in massive central galaxies, suggesting LISA will probe distinct galactic environments. Only $\sim 10\%$ of the remnant MBHs are bright AGNs, mostly from mergers with $M_{\mathrm{BH}} &gt; 10^{6.5}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.

  We present the first overview of the expected quantity of signals which will showcase significant gravitational wave phase shifts caused by astrophysical environments, considering the upcoming A+ and A\# LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. We construct and analyse two general families of dephasing prescriptions with extensions to eccentric sources, as well as collect five specific prescriptions for the fundamental smoking gun physical mechanisms at play in the dynamical and AGN formation channel for stellar mass binary black holes: Roemer delays, tidal forces and hydrodynamical interactions. We compute the expected fraction of signals containing astrophysical dephasing, as a function of environmental properties and based on observed distributions of binary parameters. We find that next generation detectors can expect to find environmental effects in hundreds of detected signals.

  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 AGNs (NLS1s) represent a unique stage in the black hole growth history, characterised by low black hole masses of approximately $10^{6}$-$10^{8}$ solar masses and around-Eddington accretion rates. X-ray studies of NLS1s have largely been confined to the local Universe ($z &lt; 0.2$), while their broad-line counterparts and radio-loud quasars have been more extensively investigated at higher redshifts. In this work, we conducted an X-ray spectral analysis for 14 SDSS-observed NLS1s at $z\approx1$ in the eRASS1 catalogue. We found that all of their eROSITA observations agree with the expected rest-frame 2 keV monochromatic luminosity given their rest-frame 2500 angstrom monochromatic luminosity, further supporting evidence of AGN emission. Second, when fitted with a power-law model, most continuum spectra between 0.7-7 keV in their rest frames necessitate photon indices $\Gamma\gtrsim2.5$. Notably, the highest photon index of around 4.7 in one of our NLS1 AGNs hints at a significant contribution from soft excess emission. Finally, our analysis demonstrates that we can align the Eddington ratios with optical measurements by applying a correction factor between 10-120 to their X-ray luminosity. Although measurement uncertainty remains considerable, our findings suggest that assumptions for the standard geometrically thin accretion disc model made in previous estimations of this correction factor may not apply to near or super-Eddington NLS1 AGNs. Finally, we also compare this sample with extremely variable nearby NLS1s and other X-ray-weak AGNs, such as JWST-observed, broad-line AGNs at $z=5-6$, and underscores the importance of deeper X-ray surveys for more X-ray-weak NLS1s.

  Galaxy cluster X-ray cavities are inflated by relativistic jets that are ejected into the intracluster medium by active galactic nuclei (AGN). AGN jets prevent predicted cooling flow establishment at the cluster centre, and while this process is not well understood in existing studies, simulations have shown that the heating mechanism will depend on the type of gas that fills the cavities. Thermal and non-thermal distributions of electrons will produce different cavity Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signals, quantified by the 'suppression factor' f. This paper explores potential enhancements to prior constraints on the cavity gas type by simulating suppression factor observations with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Cluster cavities across different redshifts are observed to predict the optimum way of measuring f in future observations. We find that the SKA can constrain the suppression factor in the cavities of cluster MS 0735.6+7421 (MS0735) in as little as 4 h, with a smallest observable value of f~0.42. Additionally, while the SKA may distinguish between possible thermal or non-thermal suppression factor values within the cavities of MS0735 if it observes for more than 8 h, determining the gas type of other clusters will likely require observations at multiple frequencies. The effect of cavity line of sight (LOS) position is also studied, and degeneracies between LOS position and the measured value of f are found. Finally, we find that for small cavities (radius &lt; 80 kpc) at high redshift (z~1.5), the proposed high frequencies of the SKA (23.75-37.5 GHz) will be optimal, and that including MeerKAT antennas will improve all observations of this type.

  Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are a unique class of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) defined by sub-kpc radio emission, showing radio structure on both sides of the central engine. CSOs tend to exhibit little to no relativistic beaming, thereby allowing us to determine their physical characteristics, such as the magnetic field strength and particle energy density. Selected with a literature search, we describe VLBI observations, imaging, and analyses of 167 CSO candidates. We identified 65 new bona fide CSOs, thus almost doubling the number of known bona fide CSOs to 144. With our greater breadth of sources, we confirm that edge-dimmed CSOs (CSO-1s) may represent a more diverse population than originally expected. We highlight a number of CSOs with complex morphologies, including candidates for supermassive binary black holes (SBBHs) and CSOs that appear to have morphologies akin to wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxies, which could perhaps indicate that some CSOs are experiencing a galactic merger.

  X-rays are a critical wavelength for understanding supermassive black holes (SMBHs). X-rays probe the inner accretion flow, closest to the event horizon, where gas inspirals, releasing energy and driving black hole growth. This region also governs the launching of outflows and jets that regulate galaxy evolution and link SMBH growth to their host galaxies.   This review focuses on X-ray observations of SMBHs, through "standard accretion" in persistent Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and in extreme transient events, such as Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN), and Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs). We describe the X-ray spectral and variability properties of AGN, and the observational techniques that probe the inner accretion flow. Through understanding the phenomenology and accretion physics in standard, individual AGN, we can better search for more exotic phenomenon, including binary SMBH mergers, or Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs).   In this review, the reader will discover:   (1) X-ray variability on timescales from minutes to hours traces accretion near the event horizon.   (2) X-rays can measure the black hole mass, spin and accretion flow geometry and dynamics.   (3) In transients like TDEs, X-rays probe the newly formed accretion disk that feeds the black hole.   (4) QPEs are posited to be EMRIs orbiting accreting SMBHs that would emit low-frequency gravitational waves.   (5) Future X-ray, time-domain and multi-messenger surveys will revolutionize our understanding of SMBH growth.
