  Context: Extensive, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of nearby and higher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have shown that the UV/optical variations are well correlated with time delays which increase with increasing wavelength. Such behaviour is expected in the context of the X-ray thermal reverberation of the accretion disc in AGN. Aims: Our main objective is to use time-lag measurements of luminous AGN and fit them with sophisticated X-ray reverberation time-lags models. In this way we can investigate whether X-ray reverberation can indeed explain the observed continuum time lags, and whether time-lag measurements can be used to measure physical parameters such as the X-ray corona height and the spin of the black hole (BH) in these systems. Methods: We use archival time-lag measurements for quasars from different surveys, and we compute their rest frame, mean time-lags spectrum. We fit the data with analytical X-ray reverberation models, using $\chi^2$ statistics, and fitting for both maximal and non spinning BHs, for various colour correction values and X-ray corona heights. Results: We found that X-ray reverberation can explain very well the observed time lags, assuming the measured BH mass, accretion rate and X-ray luminosity of the quasars in the sample. The model agrees well with the data both for non-rotating and maximally rotating BHs, as long as the corona height is larger than $\sim 40$ gravitational radii. This is in agreement with previous results which showed that X-ray reverberation can also explain the disc radius in micro-lensed quasars, for the same corona heights. The corona height we measure depends on the model assumption of a perfectly flat disc. More realistic disc models may result in lower heights for the X-ray corona.

  We present and discuss two catalogues of UV-selected (NUV $&lt; 22.8$ mag) galaxies that lie within a 200 deg$^2$ area of sky covered by the ASKAP FLASH survey and have an impact parameter of less than 20 arcsec to a FLASH radio continuum source. These catalogues are designed to enable a future search for 21 cm HI absorption in and around star-forming galaxies at redshift $0.4&lt;z&lt;1$. We outline the production of this UV-bright dataset, which has optical spectroscopy from the WiggleZ and SDSS surveys and a median redshift of $\sim0.6$. Analysis of the optical spectra, using multiple diagnostic diagrams, shows that galaxies with an impact parameter of less than 5 arcsec are likely to be physically associated with the radio source and are five times more likely to be an AGN than objects without a radio match. Conversely, objects with impact factors between 5 and 20 arcsec are largely (&gt;80 percent) star-forming and resemble the overall WiggleZ population. The ($g - i$) colour evolution with redshift is consistent with a history of active star-formation, but the radio-associated objects are typically redder and have colours similar to high-excitation radio galaxies. The redshift distribution of the two catalogues matches the overall distribution for WiggleZ galaxies, despite their otherwise rare radio properties. These catalogues can be expanded in future as new radio data become available, and a forthcoming paper will present the HI absorption results.

  We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (ANG) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the universe, corresponding to a fraction of $f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10}$ at 90\% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically $f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}$. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least $\sim$$10\%$ of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.

  The relationship between galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is an area of active research. One way to investigate this is to compare parsec-scale jets formed by SMBHs with the projected shape of their kiloparsec-scale host galaxies. We analyse Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and optical images of their host galaxies. We compare the inner-jet position angle in VLBI-detected radio sources with the optical shapes of galaxies as measured by several large optical surveys. In total 6273 galaxy-AGN pairs were found. We carefully account for the systematics of the cross-matched sources and find that Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys data (DESI LS) is significantly less affected by them. Using DESI LS, with which 5853 galaxy-AGN pairs were cross-matched, we find a weak but significant alignment signal (with a p-value $\leqslant$ 0.01) between the parsec-scale AGN jet and the kpc projected minor axis of the optical host galaxy in sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. Our results show that the observed source properties are connected over 3 orders of magnitude in scale. This points towards an intimate connection between the SMBH, their host galaxies and their subsequent evolution.

  Context. A major challenge in astrophysics is classifying galaxies by their activity. Current methods often require multiple diagnostics to capture the full range of galactic activity. Furthermore, overlapping excitation sources with similar observational signatures complicate the analysis of a galaxy's activity. Aims. This study aims to create an activity diagnostic tool that overcomes the limitations of current emission line diagnostics by identifying the underlying excitation mechanisms in mixed-activity galaxies (e.g., star formation, active nucleus, or old stellar populations) and determining the dominant ones. Methods. We use the random forest machine-learning algorithm, trained on three main activity classes -- star-forming, AGN, and passive -- that represent key gas excitation mechanisms. This diagnostic employs four distinguishing features: the equivalent widths of [O iii] ${\lambda}$5007, [N ii] ${\lambda}$6584, H${\alpha}$, and the D4000 continuum break index. Results. The classifier achieves near-perfect performance, with an overall accuracy of ~ 99% and recall scores of ~ 100% for star-forming, ~ 98% for AGN, and ~ 99% for passive galaxies. These exceptional scores allow for confident decomposition of mixed activity classes into the primary gas excitation mechanisms, overcoming the limitations of current classification methods. Additionally, the classifier can be simplified to a two-dimensional diagnostic using the D4000 index and log$_{10}$(EW([O iii])$^{2}$) without significant loss of diagnostic power. Conclusions. We present a diagnostic for classifying galaxies by their primary gas excitation mechanisms and deconstructing the activity of mixed-activity galaxies into these components. This method covers the full range of galaxy activity. Aditionally, D4000 index serves as an indicator for resolving the degeneracy among various activity components.

  We combine the power of blind integral field spectroscopy from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) with sources detected by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) to construct the HETDEX-LOFAR Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog. Starting from the first data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), including a value-added catalog with photometric redshifts, we extracted 28,705 HETDEX spectra. Using an automatic classifying algorithm, we assigned each object a star, galaxy, or quasar label along with a velocity/redshift, with supplemental classifications coming from the continuum and emission line catalogs of the internal, fourth data release from HETDEX (HDR4). We measured 9,087 new redshifts; in combination with the value-added catalog, our final spectroscopic redshift sample is 9,710 sources. This new catalog contains the highest substantial fraction of LOFAR galaxies with spectroscopic redshift information; it improves archival spectroscopic redshifts, and facilitates research to determine the [O II] emission properties of radio galaxies from $0.0 &lt; z &lt; 0.5$, and the Ly$\alpha$ emission characteristics of both radio galaxies and quasars from $1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$. Additionally, by combining the unique properties of LOFAR and HETDEX, we are able to measure star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses. Using the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS), we measure the emission lines of [O III], [Ne III], and [O II] and evaluate line-ratio diagnostics to determine whether the emission from these galaxies is dominated by AGN or star formation and fit a new SFR-L$_{150MHz}$ relationship.

  The gas dynamics of galaxies provide critical insights into the evolution of both baryons and dark matter (DM) across cosmic time. In this context, galaxies at cosmic noon -- the period characterized by the most intense star formation and black hole activities -- are particularly significant. In this work, we present an analysis of the gas dynamics of PKS 0529-549: a galaxy at $z\simeq2.6$, hosting a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN). We use new ALMA observations of the [CI] (2-1) line at a spatial resolution of 0.18$''$ ($\sim$1.5 kpc). We find that (1) the molecular gas forms a rotation-supported disk with $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{\rm v}=6\pm3$ and displays a flat rotation curve out to 3.3 kpc; (2) there are several non-circular components including a kinematically anomalous structure near the galaxy center, a gas tail to the South-West, and possibly a second weaker tail to the East; (3) dynamical estimates of gas and stellar masses from fitting the rotation curve are inconsistent with photometric estimates using standard gas conversion factors and stellar population models, respectively; these discrepancies may be due to systematic uncertainties in the photometric masses, in the dynamical masses, or in the case a more massive radio-loud AGN-host galaxy is hidden behind the gas-rich [CI] emitting starburst galaxy along the line of sight. Our work shows that in-depth investigations of 3D line cubes are crucial for revealing the complexity of gas dynamics in high-$z$ galaxies, in which regular rotation may coexist with non-circular motions and possibly tidal structures.

  Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations provide valuable insights on galaxy evolution when coupled with observational data. Comparisons with real galaxies are typically performed via scaling relations of model fitting. Here we follow an alternative approach based on the spectral variance in a model-independent way. We build upon the work presented in Sharbaf et al. (2023) that studied the covariance of high quality SDSS continuum-subtracted spectra in a relatively narrow range of velocity dispersion (100-150 km/s). Here the same analysis is applied to synthetic data from the EAGLE and Illustris TNG100 simulations, to assess the ability of these runs to mimic real galaxies. The real and simulated spectra are consistent regarding spectral variance, although with subtle differences that can inform the implementation of subgrid physics. Spectral fitting done a posteriori on stacks segregated with respect to latent space reveals that the first principal component (PC1) is predominantly influenced by the stellar age distribution, with an underlying age-metallicity degeneracy. Good agreement is found regarding star formation prescriptions but there is disagreement with AGN feedback, that also affects the subset of quiescent galaxies. We show a substantial difference in the implementation of the AGN subgrid, regarding central black hole seeding, that could lead to the mismatch. Differences are manifest between these two simulations in the star formation histories stacked with respect to latent space. We emphasise that this methodology only relies on the spectral variance to assess whether simulations provide a true representation of galaxy formation.

  With a growing number of facilities able to monitor the entire sky and produce light curves with a cadence of days, in recent years there has been an increased rate of detection of sources whose variability deviates from standard behavior, revealing a variety of exotic nuclear transients. The aim of the present study is to disentangle the nature of the transient AT 2021hdr, whose optical light curve used to be consistent with a classic Seyfert 1 nucleus, which was also confirmed by its optical spectrum and high-energy properties. From late 2021, AT 2021hdr started to present sudden brightening episodes in the form of oscillating peaks in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, and the same shape is observed in X-rays and UV from Swift data. The oscillations occur every about 60-90 days with amplitudes of around 0.2 mag in the g and r bands. Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations show no radio emission at milliarcseconds scale. It is argued that these findings are inconsistent with a standard tidal disruption event (TDE), a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH), or a changing-look active galactic nucleus (AGN); neither does this object resemble previous observed AGN flares, and disk or jet instabilities are an unlikely scenario. Here, we propose that the behavior of AT 2021hdr might be due to the tidal disruption of a gas cloud by a BSMBH. In this scenario, we estimate that the putative binary has a separation of about 0.83 mpc and would merge in about 70000 years. This galaxy is located at 9 kpc from a companion galaxy, and in this work we report this merger for the first time. The oscillations are not related to the companion galaxy.
