  We exploit a sample of 80,000 SDSS central galaxies to investigate the effect of AGN feedback on their evolution. We trace the demographics of optically-selected AGN (Seyferts) as a function of their internal properties and environment. We find that the preeminence of AGN as the dominant ionising mechanism increases with stellar mass, overtaking star-formation for galaxies with $M_\text{stellar} \geq 10^{11}M_\odot$. The AGN fraction changes systematically with the galaxies' star-formation activity. Within the blue cloud, this fraction increases as star-formation activity declines, reaching a maximum near the green valley ($\sim 17 \pm 4\%$), followed by a decrease as the galaxies transition into the red sequence. This systematic trend provides evidence that AGN feedback plays a key role in regulating and suppressing star formation. In general, Seyfert central galaxies achieve an early-type morphology while they still host residual star formation. This suggests that, in all environments, the morphology of Seyfert galaxies evolves from late- to early-type before their star formation is fully quenched. Stellar mass plays an important role in this morphological transformation: while low mass systems tend to emerge from the green valley with an elliptical morphology (T-Type $\sim -2.5 \pm 0.7$), their high-mass counterparts maintain a spiral morphology deeper into the red sequence. In high-stellar-mass centrals, the fraction of Seyferts increases from early- to late-type galaxies, indicating that AGN feedback may be linked with the morphology and its transformation. Our analysis further suggests that AGN are fuelled by their own host halo gas reservoir, but when in group centrals can also increase their gas reservoir via interactions with satellite galaxies.

  We present the first spatially resolved maps of gas-phase metallicity for dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z$ $\sim$ 4, from the JWST TEMPLATES Early Release Science program, derived from NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy of the H$\alpha$ and [NII] emission lines. Empirically derived literature optical line calibrations are used to determine that the sources are highly metal rich, with both appearing to display regions of supersolar metallicity, particularly in SPT2147-50. While we cannot rule out shocks or AGN in these regions, we suggest that the two systems have already undergone significant enrichment as a result of their extremely high star-formation rates. Utilising ALMA rest-frame 380$\mu$m continuum and [CI]($^3$P$_2$-$^3$P$_1$) line maps we compare metallicity and gas-to-dust ratio variations in the two galaxies, finding the two to be anticorrelated on highly resolved spatial scales, consistent with various literature studies of $z$ $\sim$ 0 galaxies. The data are indicative of the enormous potential of JWST to probe the enrichment of the interstellar medium on $\sim$kpc scales in extremely dust-obscured systems at $z$ $\sim$ 4 and beyond.

  We propose a novel explanation for the 18 TeV gamma ray from GRB 221009A observed by LHAASO. High-energy neutrinos are converted into axion-like particles (ALPs) via their interaction with the cosmic neutrino background. Subsequently, ALPs are converted into high-energy photons in the magnetic field of our galaxy. We compute the fluxes of neutrinos, ALPs, and photons reaching Earth. IceCube's constraints on the neutrino flux from GRB 221009A translate into a severe upper bound on the photon flux. We find a range of parameters where all existing bounds are satisfied and the 18 TeV LHAASO photon can be explained. In the future, the specific correlation between the photon and neutrino flux reaching Earth from powerful neutrino sources with energies larger than 10 TeV such as GRBs or AGNs, can be used as a tool to differentiate our explanation from the alternatives suggested in the literature. We discuss how the interactions of our scenario can be embedded within electroweak gauge-invariant models, avoiding various cosmological and terrestrial bounds. We comment on the possibility of explaining the 251 TeV photon observed by the Carpet-2 detector, taking into account the bounds from the observation of high-energy neutrinos from TXS 0506+056.

  The measured ages of massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\sim 3-4$ imply that massive galaxies quench as early as $z\sim 6$. While the number of spectroscopic confirmations of quiescent galaxies at $z &lt; 3$ has increased over the years, there are only a handful at $z &gt; 3.5$. We report spectroscopic redshifts of one secure ($z=3.757$) and two tentative ($z = 3.336$, $z=4.673$) massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) &gt; 10.3$) quiescent galaxies with 11 hours of Keck/MOSFIRE $K$-band observations. Our candidates were selected from the FENIKS survey, which uses deep Gemini/Flamingos-2 $K_b$ $K_r$ imaging optimized for increased sensitivity to the characteristic red colors of galaxies at $z &gt; 3$ with strong Balmer/4000 \AA\ breaks. The rest-frame $UVJ$ and $(ugi)_s$ colors of 3/4 quiescent candidates are consistent with $1-2$ Gyr old stellar populations. This places these galaxies as the oldest objects at these redshifts, and challenges the notion that quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 3$ are all recently-quenched, "post-starburst'' galaxies. Our spectroscopy shows that the other quiescent-galaxy candidate is a broad-line AGN ($z = 3.594$) with strong, redshifted $H\beta$+[O III] emission with a velocity offset $&gt;1000$ km/s, indicative of a powerful outflow. The star-formation history of our highest redshift candidate suggests that its progenitor was already in place by $z \sim 7-11$, reaching $\sim$ 10$^{11} M_{\odot}$ by $z \simeq 10$. These observations reveal the limit of what is possible with deep near-infrared photometry and targeted spectroscopy from the ground and demonstrate that secure spectroscopic confirmation of quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 4$ is only feasible with JWST.

  We present the Lyman-$a$ (Lya) Luminosity Function (LF) at $2.05&lt;z&lt;3.75$, estimated from a sample of 67 Lya-emitter (LAE) candidates in the J-PAS Pathfinder surveys: miniJPAS and J-NEP. These two surveys cover a total effective area of $\sim 1.14$ deg$^2$ with 54 Narrow Band (NB) filters across the optical range, with typical limiting magnitudes of $\sim 23$. This set of NBs allows to probe Lya emission in a wide and continuous range of redshifts. We develop a method for detecting Lya emission for the estimation of the Lya LF using the whole J-PAS filter set. We test this method by applying it to the miniJPAS and J-NEP data. In order to compute the corrections needed to estimate the Lya LF and to test the performance of the candidates selection method, we build mock catalogs. These include representative populations of Lya Emitters at $1.9&lt;z&lt;4.5$ as well as their expected contaminants, namely low-$z$ galaxies and $z&lt;2$ QSOs. We show that our method is able to provide the Lya LF at the intermediate-bright range of luminosity ($\rm 10^{43.5} erg\,s^{-1} \lesssim L_{Lya} \lesssim 10^{44.5} erg\,s^{-1}$). The photometric information provided by these surveys suggests that our samples are dominated by bright, Lya-emitting Active Galactic Nuclei. At $L_{{\rm Ly}a}&lt;10^{44.5}$ erg\,s$^{-1}$, we fit our Lya LF to a power-law with slope $A=0.70\pm0.25$. We also fit a Schechter function to our data, obtaining: Log$(\Phi^* / \text{Mpc$^{-3}$})=-6.30^{+0.48}_{-0.70}$, Log$(L^*/ \rm erg\,s^{-1})=44.85^{+0.50}_{-0.32}$, $a=-1.65^{+0.29}_{-0.27}$. Overall, our results confirm the presence of an AGN component at the bright-end of the Lya LF. In particular, we find no significant contribution of star-forming LAEs to the Lya LF at Log$(L_{\rm Lya}$ / erg\,s$^{-1}$)&gt;43.5. This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the results that can be obtained with the upcoming data releases of the J-PAS survey.
