  Characterizing the growth of supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) is critical to the evolution of galaxies, however the majority of this activity is obscured, rendering traditional tracers of active SMBHs, such as in the restframe optical/UV, ineffective. The mid-infrared has been particularly successful in revealing obscured AGN activity however much of this work is confined to the local universe due to the lack of a far-IR telescope with the required sensitivity and wavelength coverage. In this work we demonstrate the effectiveness of PRIMA (PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics), a concept 1.8m far-IR observatory, to detect and characterize deeply obscured galaxy nuclei over cosmic time. With the PRIMAger instrument covering 25 - 235 $\mu$m, we find that we can accurately detect obscured nuclei via the deep silicate absorption at restframe $9.8 \mu$m between $z=2-7$. Additionally, the FIRESS spectrograph can produce R$\sim$100 spectra of obscured nuclei out to $z\sim7$, detecting Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), ices, ionized and molecular gas. With the large number of deeply obscured nuclei PRIMA can detect and characterize, such a mission is critical to understanding the growth of SMBHs.

  VERITAS began full-scale operations in 2007 and it remains one of the world's most sensitive very-high-energy (VHE; E &gt;100 GeV) gamma-ray observatories. More than 8,300 hours (~50%) of its good-weather data were targeted on active galactic nuclei (AGN). Many of these observations were taken as part of an ongoing comprehensive program to discover new VHE AGN. Upon discovery, the VERITAS collaboration leverages VHE spectral and variability measurements, and accompanying broadband observations to probe the underlying jet-powered processes in AGN. Recent scientific highlights from the VERITAS AGN discovery program, including the VHE discoveries of B2 0912+29, 1ES 1028+511, 1ES 1118+424 and RBS 1366, are presented.

  We derive Fe-abundance ratios of 6 galaxies at $z=9-12$ with $-22&lt;M_{\mathrm{UV}}&lt;-19$ whose JWST/NIRSpec spectra achieve very high signal-to-noise ratios, $\mathrm{SNR}=40-230$, at the rest-frame UV wavelength. We fit stellar synthesis model spectra to these JWST spectra, carefully masking out nebular emission, interstellar absorption, and non-iron stellar absorption lines, and obtain Fe-abundance ratios of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-2-0$ for 4 galaxies and upper limits of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\sim-1$ for 2 galaxies. We compare these [Fe/H] values with the oxygen abundances of these galaxies ($7.2&lt;12+\log{\mathrm{(O/H)}}&lt;7.9$) in the same manner as previous studies of low-$z$ galaxies, and derive oxygen-to-iron abundance ratios [O/Fe]. We find that majority of (4 out of 6) galaxies are consistent with iron-poor abundance ratios ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}\gtrsim0$) while that 2 out of 6 galaxies, GS-z11-0 and GN-z11, show Fe enhancements ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}&lt;0$), especially GS-z11-0 ($z=11.12$) with a Fe enhancement ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.91_{-0.42}^{+0.35}$) beyond the solar-abundance ratio at $\sim3\sigma$. Because, unlike GS-z11-0, GN-z11 ($z=10.60$) may be an AGN, we constrain [O/Fe] via FeII emission under the assumption of AGN and confirm that the Fe enhancement is consistent even in the case of AGN. While [O/Fe] values of the majority of the galaxies are explained by the chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), the Fe enhancements of GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 are puzzling. We develop chemical evolution models, and find that the iron enhancements against oxygen in GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 can be explained by 1) pair-instability supernovae/bright hypernovae with little contribution of CCSNe or 2) Type-Ia supernovae with short delay time ($\sim30-50$ Myr) with a top-light initial mass function.

  Coronal lines are forbidden emission lines with a ionisation potential $\chi\gtrsim100\,{\rm eV}$. They are linked to energetic phenomena triggered by AGNs in the circumnuclear medium. We present the first high-angular-resolution integral-field analysis of the $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]\,\lambda6087$ coronal line in a sample of four nearby low-inclination Seyfert galaxies (three of Type 1 and one of Type 2). The data were obtained with the adaptive-optics-assisted mode of MUSE, and have angular resolutions of $0.06-0.18\,{\rm arcsec}$, allowing us to probe regions down to a few tens of parsecs in size. In three of the objects, we find a resolved coronal emission in a relatively compact configuration ($\lesssim200\,{\rm pc}$ in radius). The coronal emission is smooth and symmetric with respect to the centre of the galaxy, except for one object where an off-nucleus clump of emission is detected. Through the use of spectroastrometry we find that the $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]$ outflow of the Type 2 AGN host has a redshifted and a blueshifted component whose centroids are separated by $\sim20\,{\rm pc}$. We interpret this as evidence that some of the coronal emission comes from the inner part of a biconic outflow, also seen in low-ionisation lines. Similar $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]$ properties are found in two of the Type 1 AGN hosts, but with a much smaller separation between the centroids of the lobes of the outflow ($&lt;7\,{\rm pc}$). This could be due to the foreshortening of the axis of the bicone in Type 1 objects. We also studied the spectrum of the unresolved nuclear source and found that in three out of four galaxies a fraction of at least $\sim60\%$ of the $[\textrm{Fe VII}]$ emission has kinematics similar to those of $[{\rm O\,III}]$. We conclude that part of the coronal emission within the inner few tens of parsecs is co-spatial and shares kinematics with the outflows as traced by lower-ionisation lines.

  We investigate the relationships between the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM), traced by Ca II absorption lines, and those of galaxies at $z&lt;0.4$ by utilizing a galaxy-quasar pair sample compiled from the Year 1 data of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). This large dataset, containing $\sim 900,000$ galaxy-quasar pairs within $200\,\rm kpc$, enables us to obtain composite spectra with sensitivity reaching to $\text{m\r{A}}$ level and to explore the Ca II absorption as a function of stellar mass, SFR, redshift, and galaxy types, including AGNs. Our results show a positive correlation between the absorption strength and stellar mass of star-forming galaxies with $\langle W_{0}^{\rm Ca\ II}\rangle \propto M_{*}^{0.5}$ over three orders of magnitude in stellar mass from $\sim 10^{8}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, while such a mass dependence is weaker for quiescent galaxies. For galaxies with similar mass, we find that Ca II absorption is stronger around star-forming galaxies than around quiescent galaxies especially within the inner regions ($&lt;30\,\rm kpc$) of the halos. Among star-forming galaxies, the Ca II absorption further correlates with SFR, following $\propto \mathrm{SFR^{0.3}}$. However, in contrast to the results at higher redshifts, we find that stronger absorption around star-forming galaxies is not preferentially observed along the minor axis of galaxies, indicating a possible redshift evolution of CGM dynamics resulting from galactic feedback. Moreover, no significant difference between the properties of the cool gas around AGNs and galaxies is detected. Finally, we measure the absorption profiles with respect to the virial radius of dark matter halos and estimate the total Ca II mass in the CGM. The results show that the CGM contains a metal mass comparable to the metal mass in the ISM of galaxies.
