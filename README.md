  We explore the dependence of global galaxy properties in the SIMBA simulation as a function of distance from filaments identified using DisPerSE. We exclude halos with mass $M_h&gt;10^{13}M_\odot$ to mitigate the impact of group and cluster environments. Galaxies near filaments are more massive and have more satellites, which we control for by examining deviations from best-fit scaling relations. At $z=0$, star formation (SF) is significantly suppressed within $\lesssim 100$ kpc of filaments, more strongly for satellites, indicating substantial pre-processing in filaments. By $z=2$, the trend is weak and if anything indicates an increase in SF activity close to filaments. The suppression at $z\lesssim 1$ is accompanied by lowered HI fractions, and increased metallicities, quenched fractions, and dispersion-dominated systems. H2 fractions are not strongly suppressed when controlling for stellar mass, suggesting that star formation efficiency drives the drop in SF. By comparing amongst different SIMBA feedback variant runs, we show that the majority of SF suppression owes to filamentary shock-heating, but there is a non-trivial additional effect from AGN feedback. When looking around massive ($M_h&gt;10^{13}M_\odot$) halos, those galaxies near filaments behave somewhat differently, indicating that filaments provide an additional environmental effect relative to halos. Finally, we compare SIMBA results to EAGLE and IllustrisTNG at $z=0$, showing that all models predict SF suppression within $\lesssim 100$ kpc of filaments, nonetheless, detailed differences may be observationally testable.

  We investigate the X-ray variability properties of Seyfert1 Galaxies belonging to the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). The sample includes 151 unobscured (N$_{\rm H}&lt;10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGNs observed with XMM-Newton for a total exposure time of ~27 Ms, representing the deepest variability study done so far with high signal-to-noise XMM-Newton observations, almost doubling the number of observations analysed in previous works. We constrain the relation between the normalised excess variance and the 2-10 keV AGN luminosities, black hole masses and Eddington ratios. We find a highly significant correlation between $\sigma^{2}_{NXS}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$, with a scatter of ~0.85 dex. For sources with high $L_{2-10}$ this correlation has a lower normalization, confirming that more luminous (higher mass) AGNs show less variability. We explored the $\sigma^{2}_{NXS}$ vs $M_{\rm BH}$ relation for the sub-sample of sources with $M_{\rm BH}$ estimated via the "reverberation mapping" technique, finding a tighter anti-correlation, with a scatter of ~ 0.65 dex. We examine how the $\sigma^{2}_{NXS}$ changes with energy by studying the relation between the variability in the hard (3-10 keV) and the soft (0.2-1 keV)/medium (1-3 keV) energy bands, finding that the spectral components dominating the hard energy band are more variable than the spectral components dominating in softer energy bands, on timescales shorter than 10 ks.

  an increase in detected merger fraction with AGN luminosity

  Despite the importance of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution, the mechanisms that fuel AGN activity remain poorly understood. Theoretical models suggest that major mergers of galaxies contribute strongly to AGN fuelling, particularly at high AGN luminosities. The connection between mergers and AGN activity has therefore been widely studied, although with contradictory results. Some studies find a strong connection between mergers and AGN, while others find merger fractions in AGN hosts to match those in the inactive galaxy population. To address these apparent contradictions, I present a complete and systematic analysis of detected merger fractions in AGN hosts from the literature. I assess if discrepancies between studies are indicative of systematic uncertainties and biases and analyse the detected merger fraction as a function of luminosity, redshift, and AGN selection method. X-ray selected AGN samples show comparable detected merger fractions across studies and major mergers do not dominate triggering in this AGN population. On the other hand, signatures of significant merger contribution to the AGN population are observed in a small fraction of primarily radio selected and reddened AGN samples. It is unclear if this is due to observational biases or physical differences in the host galaxies. There is no correlation between the detected merger fraction and AGN luminosity. This lack of correlation between detected merger fraction and AGN luminosity, which has previously been reported in the literature, cannot be explained by systematic uncertainties and observational biases.

  We present a study aimed at understanding the physical phenomena underlying the formation and evolution of galaxies following a data-driven analysis of spectroscopic data based on the variance in a carefully selected sample. We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) independently to three subsets of continuum-subtracted optical spectra, segregated into their nebular emission activity as quiescent, star-forming, and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We emphasize that the variance of the input data in this work only relates to the absorption lines in the photospheres of the stellar populations. The sample is taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the stellar velocity dispersion range 100-150 km/s, to minimise the ``blurring'' effect of the stellar motion. We restrict the analysis to the first three principal components (PCs), and find that PCA segregates the three types with the highest variance mapping SSP-equivalent age, along with an inextricable degeneracy with metallicity, even when all three PCs are included. Spectral fitting shows that stellar age dominates PC1, whereas PC2 and PC3 have a mixed dependence of age and metallicity. The trends support - independently of any model fitting - the hypothesis of an evolutionary sequence from star-formation to AGN to quiescence. As a further test of the consistency of the analysis, we apply the same methodology in different spectral windows, finding similar trends, but the variance is maximal in the blue wavelength range, roughly around the 4000A break.

  We present detailed and comprehensive data reduction and point-spread-function (PSF) model construction for all public JWST NIRCam imaging data from the COSMOS-Web treasury program (up to June 2023, totaling 0.28 ${\rm deg}^2$). We show that the NIRCam PSF has significant short-timescale temporal variations and random spatial variations in all four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W). Combining NIRCam with archival HST imaging, we perform multiwavelength AGN+host image decomposition to study the properties of 143 X-ray-selected ($L_{\rm bol}=10^{43.6-47.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$) broad-line AGNs at $0.35\lesssim z \lesssim 3.5$. Leveraging the superb resolution, wavelength coverage, and sensitivity of NIRCam, we successfully detect host stellar emission after decomposing the central AGN point source in 142 objects. $\sim 2/3$ AGNs are in star-forming galaxies based on the UVJ diagram, suggesting no instantaneous negative AGN feedback. X-ray-selected broad-line AGN hosts follow a similar stellar mass-size relation as inactive galaxies, albeit with slightly smaller galaxy sizes. We find that although major mergers are rare ($\sim$7-22%) among the sample, more subtle non-axisymmetric features from stellar bars, spiral arms, and minor mergers are ubiquitous, highlighting the importance of secular processes and minor mergers in triggering AGN activity. For a subsample of 30 AGNs at $1&lt;z&lt;2.5$ with black hole mass measurements from single epoch spectra, they follow a similar black hole mass-stellar mass relation as local inactive early-type galaxies but reside preferentially near the upper envelope of nearby AGNs. We caution that selection biases and intrinsic differences of AGN populations at different redshifts may significantly affect their location on the black hole mass-stellar mass plane.

  Post-merger galaxies are unique laboratories to study the triggering and interplay of star-formation and AGN activity. Combining new, high resolution, 10 GHz Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations with archival radio surveys, we have examined the radio properties of 28 spheroidal post-merger galaxies. We find a general lack of extended emission at (sub-)kiloparsec scales, indicating the prevalence of compact, nuclear radio emission in these post-merger galaxies, with the majority (16/18; 89\%) being radio-quiet at 10 GHz. Using multi-wavelength data, we determine the origin of the radio emission, discovering 14 new radio AGN and 4 post-mergers dominated by emission from a population of supernova remnants. Among the radio AGN, almost all are radio-quiet (12/14; 86\%). We discover a new dual AGN (DAGN) candidate, J1511+0417, and investigate the radio properties of the DAGN candidate J0843+3549. 4 of these radio AGN are hosted by SF emission-line galaxies, suggesting that radio AGN activity may be present during periods of SF activity in post-mergers. The low jet powers and compact morphologies of these radio AGN also point to a scenario in which AGN feedback may be efficient in this sample of post-mergers. Lastly, we present simulated, multi-frequency observations of the 14 radio AGN with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the VLBI capabilities of the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) to assess the feasibility of these instruments in searches for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs).
