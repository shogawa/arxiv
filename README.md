  The dense and dynamic environments within active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks may serve as prolific birthplaces for binary black holes (BBHs) and one possible origin for some of the BBHs detected by gravitational-wave (GW) observatories. We show that a considerable fraction of the BBH in AGN disks will be strongly lensed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Thus, the non-observation of lensed GW signals can be used to constrain the fraction of BBH binaries residing in AGN disks. The non-detection of lensing with current ${\cal O}(100)$ detections will be sufficient to start placing constraints on the fraction of BBHs living within accretion disks near the SMBH. In the next-generation detectors era, with ${\cal O}(10^5)$ BBH observations and no lensed events, we will be able to rule out most migration traps as dominant birthplaces of BBH mergers; moreover, we will be able to constrain the minimum size of the accretion disk. On the other hand, should AGNs constitute a major formation channel, lensed events from AGNs will become prominent in the future.

  This paper addresses, for the first time, a key aspect of the phenomenology of Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) -- the characteristics of their radio spectra. We present a radio-spectrum description of a complete sample of high luminosity CSOs (CSO-2s), which shows that they exhibit the \textit{complete} range of spectral types, including flat-spectrum sources ($\alpha \ge -0.5$), steep-spectrum sources ($\alpha &lt; -0.5$), and peaked-spectrum sources. We show that there is no clear correlation between spectral type and size, but there is a correlation between the high-frequency spectral index and both object type and size. We also show that, to avoid biasing the data and to understand the various classes of jetted-AGN involved, the complete range of spectral types should be included in studying the general phenomenology of compact jetted-AGN, and that complete samples must be used, selected over a wide range of frequencies. We discuss examples that demonstrate these points. We find that the high-frequency spectral indices of CSO-2s span $-1.3 &lt;\alpha_{\rm hi} &lt; -0.3$, and hence that radio spectral signatures cannot be used to discriminate definitively between CSO-2s, binary galactic nuclei, and millilensed objects, unless they have $\alpha_{\rm hi} &gt;-0.3$.

  The James Webb Space telescope has discovered an abundant population of broad line emitters, typical signposts for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Many of these sources have red colors and a compact appearance that has led to naming them `Little Red Dots'. In this paper we develop a detailed framework to estimate the photometry of AGN embedded in galaxies extracted from the Obelisk cosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected Little Red Dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole population. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and attenuation for AGN we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as galaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is not too much or too little attenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGN do not enter the cLRD selection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue filters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs are also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington, and/or high ratios between black hole and stellar mass.

  NEXUS is a JWST Multi-Cycle (Cycles 3-5; 368 primary hrs) GO Treasury imaging and spectroscopic survey around the North Ecliptic Pole. It contains two overlapping tiers. The Wide tier ($\sim 400~{\rm arcmin}^2$) performs NIRCam/WFSS 2.4-5 micron grism spectroscopy with three epochs over 3 years (final continuum ${\rm S/N/pixel&gt;3}$ at F444W$&lt;22.2$). The Deep tier ($\sim 50~{\rm arcmin}^2$) performs high-multiplexing NIRSpec 0.6-5.3 micron MOS/PRISM spectroscopy for $\sim 10,000$ targets, over 18 epochs with a 2-month cadence (epoch/final continuum ${\rm S/N/pixel&gt;3}$ at F200W$\lesssim 27/29$). All epochs have simultaneous multi-band NIRCam and MIRI imaging ($5\sigma$ final depths of $\sim 28-29$ in NIRCam and $\sim 25$ in MIRI). The field is within the continuous viewing zone of JWST, and is fully covered by the Euclid Ultra-Deep Field, with 0.9-2 micron deep Euclid spectroscopy and cadenced photometry. NEXUS has three science pillars. First, with its massive and nearly complete (flux-limited) spectroscopic samples and deep photometry, it will perform efficient classification and physical characterization of galaxies and AGNs from $z\sim 1$ to Cosmic Dawn. With the large contiguous area coverage, it will measure the spatial clustering and demography of the first galaxies and SMBHs at $z&gt;6$. Second, multi-epoch observations enable systematic time-domain investigations, focusing on $z&gt;3$ transients and low-mass AGN reverberation mapping. Third, the comprehensive data set will enable knowledge transfer to other legacy fields, create data challenges, and initiate benchmark work for future space missions. With rapid public releases of processed data and an open invitation for collaboration, NEXUS aims for broad and swift community engagement, to become a powerhouse to drive transformative advancements in multiple key science areas of astronomy.   

On the Origin of Quenched but Gas-rich Regions at Kiloparsec Scales in
  Nearby Galaxies

  We use resolved spectroscopy from MaNGA to investigate the significance of both local and global properties of galaxies to the cessation of star formation at kpc scales. Quenched regions are identified from a sample of isolated disk galaxies by a single-parameter criterion $\rm {D}_n(4000)$ - $\log$ $\rm {EW}({H\alpha})$$~&gt;1.6-\log 2=1.3$, and are divided into gas-rich quenched regions (GRQRs) and gas-poor quenched regions (GPQRs) according to the surface density of cold gas ($\rm \Sigma_{gas}$). Both types of quenched regions tend to be hosted by non-AGN galaxies with relatively high mass ($M_\ast$$\gtrsim 10^{10}M_\odot$) and red colors (${\rm NUV}-r \gtrsim 3$), as well as low star formation rate and high central density at fixed mass. They span wide ranges in other properties including structural parameters that are similar to the parent sample, indicating that the conditions responsible for quenching in gas-rich regions are largely independent on the global properties of galaxies. We train random forest (RF) classifiers and regressors for predicting quenching in our sample with 15 local/global properties. $\Sigma_\ast$ is the most important property for quenching, especially for GRQRs. These results strongly indicate the important roles of low-mass hot evolved stars which are numerous and long-lived in quenched regions and can provide substantial radiation pressure to support the surrounding gas against gravitational collapse. The different feature importance for quenching as found previously by Bluck et al. (2020a,b) are partly due to the different definitions of quenched regions, particularly the different requirements on $\rm {EW}({H\alpha})$.
