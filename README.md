  We present deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/MIRI F560W observations of a flux-limited, ALMA-selected sample of 28 galaxies at z=0.5-3.6 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). The data from the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) reveal the stellar structure of the HUDF galaxies at rest-wavelengths of &gt;1 micron for the first time. We revise the stellar mass estimates using new JWST photometry and find good agreement with pre-JWST analysis; the few discrepancies can be explained by blending issues in the earlier lower-resolution Spitzer data. At z~2.5, the resolved rest-frame near-infrared (1.6 micron) structure of the galaxies is significantly more smooth and centrally concentrated than seen by HST at rest-frame 450 nm (F160W), with effective radii of Re(F560W)=1-5 kpc and S\'ersic indices mostly close to an exponential (disk-like) profile (n~1), up to n~5 (excluding AGN). We find an average size ratio of Re(F560W)/Re(F160W)~0.7 that decreases with stellar mass. The stellar structure of the ALMA-selected galaxies is indistinguishable from a HUDF reference sample of galaxies with comparable MIRI flux density. We supplement our analysis with custom-made, position-dependent, empirical PSF models for the F560W observations. The results imply that an older and smoother stellar structure is in place in massive gas-rich, star-forming galaxies at Cosmic Noon, despite a more clumpy rest-frame optical appearance, placing additional constraints on galaxy formation simulations. As a next step, matched-resolution, resolved ALMA observations will be crucial to further link the mass- and light-weighted galaxy structures to the dusty interstellar medium.

  The evidence for multi-messenger photon and neutrino emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056 has demonstrated the importance of realtime follow-up of neutrino events by various ground- and space-based facilities. The effort of H.E.S.S. and other experiments in coordinating observations to obtain quasi-simultaneous multiwavelength flux and spectrum measurements has been critical in measuring the chance coincidence with the high-energy neutrino event IC-170922A and constraining theoretical models. For about a decade, the H.E.S.S. transient program has included a search for gamma-ray emission associated with high-energy neutrino alerts, looking for gamma-ray activity from known sources and newly detected emitters consistent with the neutrino location. In this contribution, we present an overview of follow-up activities for realtime neutrino alerts with H.E.S.S. in 2021 and 2022. Our analysis includes both public IceCube neutrino alerts and alerts exchanged as part of a joint H.E.S.S.-IceCube program. We focus on interesting coincidences observed with gamma-ray sources, particularly highlighting the significant detection of PKS 0625-35, an AGN previously detected by H.E.S.S., and three IceCube neutrinos.

  Massive, starbursting galaxies in the early Universe represent some of the most extreme objects in the study of galaxy evolution. One such source is HFLS3 (z~6.34), which was originally identified as an extreme starburst galaxy with mild gravitational magnification. Here, we present new observations of HFLS3 with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU in both low (PRISM/CLEAR; R~100) and high spectral resolution (G395H/290LP; R~2700), with high spatial resolution (~0.1") and sensitivity. Thanks to the combination of the NIRSpec data and a new lensing model with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, we find that the 3"x3" field is crowded, with a lensed arc (C, z=6.3425+/-0.0002), two galaxies to the south (S1 and S2, z=6.3592+/-0.0001), two galaxies to the west (W1, z=6.3550+/-0.0001; W2, z=6.3628+/-0.0001), and two low-redshift interlopers (G1, z=3.4806+/-0.0001; G2, z=2.00+/-0.01). We present spectral fits and morpho-kinematic maps for each bright emission line (e.g., [OIII]5007, Halpha, [NII]6584) from the R2700 data for all sources except G2. From a line ratio analysis, the galaxies in C are likely powered by star formation, while we cannot rule out or confirm the presence of AGN in the other high-redshift sources. We perform gravitational lens modelling, finding evidence for a two-source composition of the lensed central object and a comparable magnification factor (mu=2.1-2.4) to previous work. The projected distances and velocity offsets of each galaxy suggest that they will merge within the next ~1Gyr. Finally, we examine the dust extinction-corrected SFR of each z&gt;6 source, finding that the total star formation (460+/-90 Msol/yr, magnification-corrected) is distributed across the six z~6.34-6.36 objects over a region of diameter ~11kpc. Altogether, this suggests that HFLS3 is not a single starburst galaxy, but instead is a merging system of star-forming galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization.

  The nature of the so-called ``changing-look'' (CL) active galactic nucleus (AGN), which is characterized by spectral-type transitions within $\sim10$~yr, remains an open question. As the first in our series of studies, we here attempt to understand the CL phenomenon from a view of the coevolution of AGNs and their host galaxies (i.e., if CL-AGNs are at a specific evolutionary stage) by focusing on the SDSS local ``partially obscured'' AGNs in which the stellar population of the host galaxy can be easily measured in the integrated spectra. A spectroscopic follow-up program using the Xinglong 2.16~m, Lick/Shane 3~m, and Keck 10~m telescopes enables us to identify in total 9 CL-AGNs from a sample of 59 candidates selected by their mid-infrared variability. Detailed analysis of these spectra shows that the host galaxies of the CL-AGNs are biased against young stellar populations and tend to be dominated by intermediate-age stellar populations. This motivates us to propose that CL-AGNs are probably particular AGNs at a specific evolutionary stage, such as a transition stage from ``feast'' to ``famine'' fueling of the supermassive black hole. In addition, we reinforce the previous claim that CL-AGNs tend to be biased against both a high Eddington ratio and a high bolometric luminosity, suggesting that the disk-wind broad-line-region model is a plausible explanation of the CL phenomenon.

  Bent radio AGN morphology depends on the density of the surrounding gas. However, bent sources are found inside and outside clusters, raising the question of how environment impacts bent AGN morphology. We analyze new LOw-Frequency Array Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release II observations of 20 bent AGNs in clusters and 15 not in clusters from the high-$z$ Clusters Occupied by Bent Radio AGN (COBRA) survey (0.35 $&lt;$ $z$ $&lt;$ 2.35). We measure the impact of environment on size, lobe symmetry, and radio luminosity. We find that the most asymmetric radio lobes lie outside of clusters and we uncover a tentative correlation between the total projected physical area and cluster overdensity. Additionally, we, for the first time, present spectral index measurements of a large sample of high-$z$ bent sources using LoTSS and Very Large Array Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (VLA FIRST) observations. We find that the median spectral index for the cluster sample is -0.76 $\pm$ 0.01, while the median spectral index for the non-cluster sample median is -0.81 $\pm$ 0.02. Furthermore, 13 of 20 cluster bent AGNs have flat cores ($\alpha$ $\geq$ -0.6) compared to 4 of 15 of non-clusters, indicating a key environmental signature. Beyond core spectral index, bent AGNs inside and outside clusters are remarkably similar. We conclude that the non-cluster sample may be more representative of bent AGNs at large offsets from the cluster center ($&gt;$ 1.2Mpc) or bent AGNs in weaker groups rather than the field.
