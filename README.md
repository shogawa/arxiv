  The Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST is expected to discover tens of millions of new Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The survey's exceptional cadence and sensitivity will enable UV/optical/NIR monitoring of a significant fraction of these objects. The unprecedented number of sources makes spectroscopic follow-up for the vast majority of them unfeasible in the near future, so most studies will have to rely on photometric redshifts estimates which are traditionally much less reliable for AGN than for inactive galaxies. This work presents a novel methodology to constrain the photometric redshift of AGNs that leverages the effects of cosmological time dilation, and of the luminosity and wavelength dependence of AGN variability. Specifically, we assume that the variability can be modeled as a damped random walk (DRW) process, and adopt a parametric model to characterize the DRW timescale ($\tau$) and asymptotic amplitude of the variability (SF$_\infty$) based on the redshift, the rest-frame wavelength, and the AGN luminosity. We construct variability-based photo-$z$ priors by modeling the observed variability using the expected DRW parameters at a given redshift. These variability-based photometric redshift (VAR-PZ) priors are then combined with traditional SED fitting to improve the redshift estimates from SED fitting.   Validation is performed using observational data from the SDSS, demonstrating significant reduction in catastrophic outliers by more than 10% in comparison with SED fitting techniques and improvements in redshift precision. The simulated light curves with both SDSS and LSST-like cadences and baselines confirm that, VAR-PZ will be able to constrain the photometric redshifts of SDSS-like AGNs by bringing the outlier fractions down to below 7% from 32% (SED-alone) at the end of the survey.

  We present a systematic analysis on the X-ray variability in 13 bright quasars at z &gt; 4.5, combining recent Swift observations from 2021 to 2023 and archival multi-epoch observations. Upper limits of the luminosity measurements were included in the analysis by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. It is found that the high-z quasars exhibit X-ray variability on both short-term (hours-to-days) and intermediate-term (weeks-to-months) timescales, with short-term variability dominating the overall variation. A linear correlation exists between the global mean ($\mu_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) and standard deviation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) of X-ray luminosities, which is independent of the X-ray photon index and optical-to-X-ray spectral slope. The localized stochastic magnetic reconnection mechanism is strongly favored, which can naturally lead to a scale-invariant power-law energy distribution and satisfactorily explain the correlation. The $\sigma$-$\mu$ correlation parallels with the well-documented rms-flux relation of low-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs), implying the magnetic reconnection mechanism could drive short-timescale X-ray variability in both high- and low-z AGNs. The highest-z quasar in our sample, J142952+544717 (z = 6.18), shows a luminosity distribution extending to ${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ with a not conspicuous median luminosity. On the other hand, J143023+420436 (z = 4.7), which hosts the most relativistic jet among known high-z blazars, is dominated in the high-luminosity regime (${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ ), making it an ideal target for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. J090630+693030 is found to have a rest-frame period of 182.46 days and J143023+420436 has a period of 16.89 days, both could be explained by the global evolution of plasmoid chains, in which magnetic islands formed during reconnection may merge successively.

  We investigate the X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs) with optical double-peaked narrow emission (DPNEL) as potential hosts of dual or binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Using a sample of 187 XRGs selected from SDSS and DESI optical spectroscopic surveys, we check the AGN nature of both emission components using the BPT diagnostics of multiple emission lines, namely {[O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007}, H$\alpha$, {[N II]$\lambda\lambda$6548,6584}, {[S II]$\lambda\lambda$6716,6731}, and H$\beta$, and mid-infrared colors. We find that the detection rate of [O III] DPNEL features in XRGs is 30% compared to just 1% in the general galaxy population (mostly radio quiet). The dual AGN fraction in DPNEL galaxies is found to depend strongly on the radio luminosity, increasing from $\sim$25% for radio-undetected to $\sim$58% in the radio-detected sample of general DPNEL galaxies. In contrast, the DPNEL XRGs and FR-II radio galaxies having higher radio power show a $\sim$95% likelihood of hosting a dual AGN. Secondly, the detection of companion galaxies in more than 30% of DPNEL XRGs suggests a vital role of mergers in the XRG formation. We also investigate the parsec-scale radio structure of the nuclei of several XRGs using Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) maps at 1.4 GHz, 4.3 GHz or 7.6 GHz and find a resolved core for only one of the XRGs. However, the flat spectral indices of the VLBA cores along with the DPNEL components exhibiting AGN characteristics, together with the detection of radio-optical offsets between the VLBA and Gaia position, are strongly indicative of XRGs being likely candidates for hosting dual/binary AGNs.

  The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at $z=1.61$ in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.4} M_\odot$) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.2} M_\odot$), located at a projected distance of $\sim 8$ kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, $\sim 20$ kpc in diameter, is expanding at $127^{+72}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying the galaxies first collided 47--96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes -- such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities -- may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the ``Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.
