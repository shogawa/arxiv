  In this work, we use 8 years of deep near-infrared imaging to select and study a new set of 601 active galaxies identified through long-term near-infrared (NIR) variability in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS). These objects are compared to 710 X-ray bright AGN detected by the Chandra X-ray observatory. We show that infrared variability and X-ray emission select distinct sets of active galaxies, finding only a 37 per cent overlap of galaxies detected by both techniques and confirming NIR-variable AGN to be typically X-ray quiet. Examining the mass functions of the active galaxies shows that NIR variability detects AGN activity in galaxies over a significantly wider range of host stellar mass compared to X-ray detection. For example, at z $\sim$ 1, variable AGN are identified among approximately 1 per cent of galaxies in a roughly flat distribution above the stellar mass completeness limit (&gt; 10$^{9}$M$_{\odot}$), while X-ray detection primarily identifies AGN in galaxies of higher mass (&gt; 10$^{10}$M$_{\odot}$). We conclude that long-term near-infrared variability provides an important new tool for obtaining more complete samples of AGN in deep survey fields.

  We derive the nitrogen and oxygen abundances in the Narrow Line Regions (NLRs) of a sample of 38 local ($z \: &lt; \: 0.4$) Seyfert~2 nuclei. For that, we consider narrow optical emission line intensities and direct estimates of the electron temperatures ($T_{\rm e}$-method). We find nitrogen abundances in the range $7.6 \: &lt; \: \rm 12+log(N/H) \: &lt; \: 8.6$ (mean value $8.06\pm0.22$) or $\rm 0.4 \: &lt; \: (N/N_{\odot}) \: &lt; 4.7$, in the metallicity regime $8.3 \: &lt; \: \rm 12+log(O/H) \: &lt; \: 9.0$. Our results indicate that the dispersion in N/H abundance for a fixed O/H value in AGNs is in agreement with that for disc \ion{H}{ii} regions with similar metallicity. We show that Seyfert~2 nuclei follow a similar (N/O)-(O/H) relation to the one followed by star-forming objects. Finally, we find that active galaxies called as 'nitrogen-loud' observed at very high redshift ($z \: &gt; \: 5$) show N/O values in consonance with those derived for local NLRs. This result indicates that the main star-formation event is completed in the early evolution stages of active galaxies.

  NGC 777 provides an example of a phenomenon observed in some group-central ellipticals, in which the temperature profile shows a central peak, despite the short central cooling time of the intra-group medium. We use deep Chandra X-ray observations of the galaxy, supported by uGMRT 400 MHz radio imaging, to investigate the origin of this hot core. We confirm the centrally-peaked temperature profile and find that entropy and cooling time both monotonically decline to low values (2.62 [+0.19, -0.18] keV cm$^2$ and 71.3 [+12.8, -13.1] Myr) in the central ~700 pc. Faint diffuse radio emission surrounds the nuclear point source, with no clear jets or lobes but extending to ~10 kpc on a northwest-southeast axis. This alignment and extent agree well with a previously identified filamentary H$\alpha$+[NII] nebula. While cavities are not firmly detected, we see X-ray surface brightness decrements on the same axis at 10-20 kpc radius which are consistent with the intra-group medium having been pushed aside by expanding radio lobes. Any such outburst must have occurred long enough ago for lobe emission to have faded below detectability. Cavities on this scale would be capable of balancing radiative cooling for at least ~240 Myr. We consider possible causes of the centrally peaked temperature profile, including gravitational heating of gas as the halo relaxes after a period of AGN jet activity, and heating by particles leaking from the remnant relativistic plasma of the old radio jets.

  We aim to identify QSO2 candidates in the redshift desert using optical and infrared photometry. At this intermediate redshift range, most of the prominent optical emission lines in QSO2 sources (e.g. CIV1549; [OIII]4959,5008) fall either outside the wavelength range of the SDSS optical spectra or in particularly noisy wavelength ranges, making QSO2 identification challenging. Therefore, we adopted a semi-supervised machine learning approach to select candidates in the SDSS galaxy sample. Recent applications of machine learning in astronomy focus on problems involving large data sets, with small data sets often being overlooked. We developed a few-shot learning approach for the identification and classification of rare-object classes using limited training data (200 sources). The new AMELIA pipeline uses a transfer-learning based approach with decision trees, distance-based, and deep learning methods to build a classifier capable of identifying rare objects on the basis of an observational training data set. We validated the performance of AMELIA by addressing the problem of identifying QSO2s at 1 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 2 using SDSS and WISE photometry, obtaining an F1-score above 0.8 in a supervised approach. We then used AMELIA to select new QSO2 candidates in the redshift desert and examined the nature of the candidates using SDSS spectra, when available. In particular, we identified a sub-population of [NeV]3426 emitters at z $\sim$ 1.1, which are highly likely to contain obscured AGNs. We used X-ray and radio cross-matching to validate our classification and investigated the performance of photometric criteria from the literature showing that our candidates have an inherent dusty nature. Finally, we derived physical properties for our QSO2 sample using photoionisation models and verified the AGN classification using an SED fitting.

  Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a potent tool for building meaningful latent representations of galaxy properties across a broad spectrum of wavelengths, ranging from optical and infrared to radio frequencies. These representations facilitate a variety of downstream tasks, including galaxy classification, similarity searches, and parameter estimation, which is why they are often referred to as foundation models. In this study, we employ CL on the latest extended DR from CALIFA survey, which encompasses 895 galaxies with enhanced spatial resolution. We demonstrate that CL can be applied to IFU surveys, even with small training sets, to meaningful embedding where galaxies are well-separated based on their physical properties. We discover that the strongest correlations in the embedding space are observed with the EW of Ha morphology, stellar metallicity, age, stellar surface mass density, the [NII]/Ha ratio, and stellar mass, in descending order of correlation strength. Additionally, we illustrate the feasibility of unsupervised separation of galaxy populations along the SFMS, successfully identifying the BC and the RS in a two-cluster scenario, and the GV population in a three-cluster scenario. Our findings indicate that galaxy luminosity profiles have minimal impact on the construction of the embedding space, suggesting that morphology and spectral features play a more significant role in distinguishing between galaxy populations. Moreover, we explore the use of CL for detecting variations in galaxy population distributions across different environments, including voids, clusters, filaments and walls. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the limitations of the CL and our specific training set in detecting subtle differences in galaxy properties, such as the presence of an AGN or other minor scale variations that exceed the scope of primary parameters like stellar mass or morphology.

  We present the results from a study of ~9,600 Broad-Line selected AGN with host galaxies detected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 (SDSS DR17). We compute ensemble variability statistics based on the comparison of the original SDSS photometric data with spectrophotometric measurements obtained days to decades later in the Sloan g-, r-, and i-bands. Galaxy and AGN templates have been fitted to the SDSS spectra to isolate the AGN component from the host galaxy. The sources have absolute magnitudes in the range -24&lt;M_i&lt;-18 and lie at redshifts less than z~0.9. A variability analysis reveals that the anti-correlation between luminosity and variability amplitude continues down to log(L_bol[erg/s]) = 43.5, demonstrating that the relationship extends by 4 orders of magnitude in AGN luminosity. To further explore the connection between AGN luminosity and variability, we determine the black hole mass and the accretion rate through measurement of the H-Beta line width and the monochromatic luminosity at rest-frame 5,100 angstrom. Our results suggest that the accretion rate is the dominant parameter impacting the amplitude of variability and that the anti-correlation between accretion rate and amplitude extends to rates as low as 1% Eddington. Moreover, we also identify an anti-correlation between variability amplitude and black hole mass, with the correlation appearing strongest among the AGN with low accretion rates.

  Circumgalactic Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) nebulae are gaseous halos around galaxies exhibiting luminous extended Ly$\alpha$ emission. This work investigates Ly$\alpha$ nebulae from deep imaging of $\sim12~\mathrm{deg}^2$ sky, targeted by the MAMMOTH-Subaru survey. Utilizing the wide-field capability of Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), we present one of the largest blind Ly$\alpha$ nebula selections, including QSO nebulae, Ly$\alpha$ blobs, and radio galaxy nebulae down to typical $2\sigma$ Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness of $(5-10)\times10^{-18}\mathrm{~erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. The sample contains 117 nebulae with Ly$\alpha$ sizes of 40 - 400 kpc, and the most gigantic one spans about 365 kpc, referred to as the Ivory Nebula. Combining with multiwavelength data, we investigate diverse nebula populations and associated galaxies. We find a small fraction of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae have QSOs ($\sim7\%$), luminous infrared galaxies ($\sim1\%$), and radio galaxies ($\sim 2\%$). Remarkably, among the 28 enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe) exceeding 100 kpc, about $80\%$ are associated with UV-faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{UV} &gt; -22$), categorized as Type II ELANe. We underscore that Type II ELANe constitute the majority but remain largely hidden in current galaxy and QSO surveys. Dusty starburst and obscured AGN activity are proposed to explain the nature of Type II ELANe. The SED of stacking all Ly$\alpha$ nebulae also reveals signs of massive dusty star-forming galaxies with obscured AGNs. We propose a model to explain the dusty nature where the diverse populations of Ly$\alpha$ nebula capture massive galaxies at different evolutionary stages undergoing violent assembling. Ly$\alpha$ nebulae provide critical insights into the formation and evolution of today's massive cluster galaxies at cosmic noon.

  Broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines (FWHM &gt; 1,000 km s$^{-1}$) are incredibly efficient tracers of the high-velocity clouds encircling Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). As a result, we search for these broad line AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) catalog. We identify 301 broad-line H$\alpha$ galaxies and 801 broad-line H$\beta$ galaxies in the catalog. In total, we detect 1,042 unique broad-line galaxies with luminosities between 10$^{37}$ - 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and inferred supermassive black hole masses between 10$^{5}$ - 10$^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$; 60 feature both broad H$\alpha$ and broad H$\beta$ emission. We also determine that the broad line region radius ranges between 0.01 - 46 light days, with a median radius of 0.1 light days (0.02 pc) for our broad H$\beta$ sample. In addition, we find that both samples feature a higher fraction of galaxy mergers (44% for the broad H$\alpha$ sample and 43% for the broad H$\beta$ sample), compared to the full MaNGA galaxy sample (26%), which suggests that merger-driven fueling is strongly active in our sample.

  Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) data analyses have shown that massive red galaxies existed at redshifts $z&gt;6$, a discovery that is difficult to understand in the context of standard cosmology ($\Lambda $CDM). Here we analyze these observations more deeply by fitting a stellar population model to the optical and near-infrared photometric data. These fits include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and with the same extinction for both (a lower extinction for the younger population is unphysical). Extra stellar populations or the inclusion of an AGN component do not significantly improve the fits. These galaxies are being viewed at very high redshifts, with an average $\langle z\rangle \approx 8.2$, when the $\Lambda$CDM Universe was only $\approx 600$ Myr old. This result conflicts with the inferred ages of these galaxies, however, which were on average between 0.9 and 2.4 Gyr old within 95% CL. Given the sequence of star formation and galaxy assembly in the standard model, these galaxies should instead be even younger than 290 Myr on average, for which our analysis assigns a probability of only $&lt;3\times 10^{-4}$ ($\gtrsim 3.6\sigma $ tension). This outcome may indicate the need to consider non-standard cosmologies. Nevertheless, our conclusions result from several approximations in stellar astrophysics and extinction, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. Further research is necessary to corroborate the possible existence of galaxies older than the $\Lambda $CDM universe at their observed redshifts.

  We present a sample of 22 massive galaxies with stellar masses $&gt;10^{10} M_{\odot}$ at $3&lt;z&lt;4$ with deep H and K-band high resolution spectra (R=3500-3000) from Keck/MOSFIRE and VLT/KMOS near-infrared spectrographs. We find a large fraction have strong [OIII]5007 and H$\beta$ emission lines with large line widths ($\sigma$ 100 -- 450 km/s). We measure the sizes of our galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope images and consider the potential kinematic scaling relations of our sample; and rule out an explanation for these broad lines in terms of galaxy-wide kinematics. Based on consideration of the [OIII]5007 $/$ H$\beta$ flux ratios, their location in the Mass--Excitation diagram, and the derived bolometric luminosities, we conclude that Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their Narrow Line Regions most likely give rise to this emission. At redshifts $3&lt;z&lt;4$, we find significantly high AGN fractions in massive galaxies, ranging from 60--70\% for the mass range $10&lt;\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&lt;11$, with a lower limit 30\% for all galaxies within that redshift range when we apply our most stringent AGN criteria. We also find a considerably lower AGN fraction in massive quiescent galaxies, ranging from 20-30\%. These fractions of AGN point to the period between $3&lt;z&lt;4$ being a time of heightened activity for the development of supermassive black holes in the massive end of the galaxy population and provide evidence for their role in the emergence of the first massive quenched galaxies at this epoch.
