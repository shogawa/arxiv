  Large-scale cosmological simulations suggest that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a crucial role in galaxy evolution. In this study, we directly test this hypothesis utilising SDSS spectra of a sample of 48 low redshift (z&lt;0.14) type 2 quasars (QSO2s). We characterised the kinematics of the warm ionised gas by performing a non-parametric analysis of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission line, as well as constrain the properties of the young stellar populations (YSP) of their host galaxies through spectral synthesis modelling. These analyses revealed that 85% of the QSO2s display gas velocity dispersions larger than that of the stellar component of their host galaxies, indicating the presence of AGN-driven outflows. Comparing the gas kinematics to the AGN properties, we found a positive correlation between gas velocity dispersion and 1.4 GHz radio luminosity but not with AGN bolometric luminosity or Eddington ratio, suggesting that, either the radio luminosity is the key factor in driving outflows or that the outflows themselves are shocking the ISM and producing synchrotron emission. We found that 98% of the sample host YSPs to varying degrees, with star formation rates (SFR) $0 \le SFR \le 92 \mbox{ M}_{\odot} \mbox{yr}^{-1}$, averaged over 100 Myr. We compared the gas kinematics and outflow properties to the SFRs to establish possible correlations which may suggest that the presence of the outflowing gas is impacting SF and find that none exists, leading to the conclusion that, on the scales probed by the SDSS fibre, AGN-driven outflows do not impact SF on the timescales probed in this study. However, we found a positive correlation between the light-weighted stellar ages of the QSO2s and the black hole mass, which may indicate that successive AGN episodes lead to the suppression of SF over the course of galaxy evolution.

  Reverberation mapping is the leading technique used to measure direct black hole masses outside of the local Universe. Additionally, reverberation measurements calibrate secondary mass-scaling relations used to estimate single-epoch virial black hole masses. The Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) conducted one of the first multi-object reverberation mapping surveys, monitoring 735 AGN up to $z\sim4$, over 6 years. The limited temporal coverage of the OzDES data has hindered recovery of individual measurements for some classes of sources, particularly those with shorter reverberation lags or lags that fall within campaign season gaps. To alleviate this limitation, we perform a stacking analysis of the cross-correlation functions of sources with similar intrinsic properties to recover average composite reverberation lags. This analysis leads to the recovery of average lags in each redshift-luminosity bin across our sample. We present the average lags recovered for the H$\beta$, Mg II and C IV samples, as well as multi-line measurements for redshift bins where two lines are accessible. The stacking analysis is consistent with the Radius-Luminosity relations for each line. Our results for the H$\beta$ sample demonstrate that stacking has the potential to improve upon constraints on the $R-L$ relation, which have been derived only from individual source measurements until now.

  The forward-modelling of galaxy surveys has recently gathered interest as one of the primary methods to achieve the precision on the estimate of the redshift distributions required by stage IV surveys. One of the key aspects of forward-modelling is the connection between the physical properties of galaxies and their intrinsic spectral energy distributions (SEDs), achieved through stellar population synthesis (SPS) codes, e.g. FSPS. However, SPS requires many detailed assumptions about the galaxy constituents, for which the model choice or parameters are currently uncertain. In this work, we perform a sensitivity study of the impact that the SED modelling choices variations have on the mean and scatter of the tomographic galaxy redshift distributions. We use the Prospector-$\beta$ model and its SPS parameters to build observed magnitudes of a fiducial sample of galaxies. We then build new samples by varying one SED modelling choice at a time. We model the colour-redshift relation of these galaxy samples using the KiDS-VIKING remapped version (McCullough et al. 2023) of the Masters et al. (2015) SOM. We place galaxies in the SOM cells according to the simulated galaxy colours. We then build color-selected tomographic bins and compare each variant's binned redshift distributions against the estimates obtained for the fiducial model. We find that the SED components related to the IMF, AGN, gas physics, and attenuation law substantially bias the mean and the scatter of the tomographic redshift distributions with respect to those estimated with the fiducial model. For the uncertainty of these choices currently present in the literature, and regardless of any stellar mass function based reweighting strategy applied, the bias in the mean and the scatter of the tomographic redshift distributions is larger than the precision requirements set by Stage IV galaxy surveys, e.g. LSST and Euclid.

  We study the impact of black hole nuclear activity on both the global and radial star formation rate (SFR) profiles in X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the field of miniJPAS, the precursor of the much wider J-PAS project. Our sample includes 32 AGN with $z&lt;0.3$ detected via the \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{Chandra} surveys. For comparison, we assembled a control sample of 71 star-forming (SF) galaxies with similar magnitudes, sizes, and redshifts.   To derive the global properties of both the AGN and the control SF sample, we used \texttt{CIGALE} to fit the spectral energy distributions derived from the 56 narrowband and 4 broadband filters from miniJPAS. We find that AGN tend to reside in more massive galaxies than their SF counterparts. After matching samples based on stellar mass and comparing their SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs), no significant differences appear. This suggests that the presence of AGN does not strongly influence overall star formation.   However, when we used miniJPAS as an integral field unit (IFU) to dissect galaxies along their position angle, a different picture emerges. We find that AGN tend to be more centrally concentrated in mass with respect to SF galaxies. Moreover, we find a suppression of the sSFR up to 1R$\mathrm{_e}$ and then an enhancement beyond 1R$\mathrm{_e}$, strongly contrasting with the decreasing radial profile of sSFRs in SF galaxies. This could point to an inside-out quenching of AGN host galaxies.   These findings suggest that the reason we do not see differences on a global scale is because star formation is suppressed in the central regions and enhanced in the outer regions of AGN host galaxies. While limited in terms of sample size, this work highlights the potential of the upcoming J-PAS as a wide-field low-resolution IFU for thousands of nearby galaxies and AGN.
