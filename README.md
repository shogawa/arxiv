  To investigate the impact of winds and low-to-moderate power jets on the cold molecular gas reservoirs of AGN, we present high angular resolution ALMA CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) observations of a sample of six type-2 quasars (QSO2s) at z$\sim$0.1 from the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample. Spatially resolved molecular line ratio maps, defined as $R_{32}=L'_{CO(3-2)}/L'_{CO(2-1)}$, and kinematic modelling were used to constrain changes in gas excitation and to identify gas outflows, respectively. We find that the molecular outflows are co-spatial with regions with $R_{32}$&gt;1, indicating enhanced temperature relative to the discs and the presence of optically thin gas in the outflows. We find mass outflow rates of 5$&lt;\dot{M}_{out}&lt;$150$M_\odot$/yr, much lower than those expected from their AGN luminosities of $10^{45.5-46}$erg/s. The outflow kinetic energies might be driven by the combined action of jets and winds/radiation pressure, with radiative coupling efficiencies ($\epsilon_{AGN}=\dot{E}_{out}/L_{bol}$) ranging from $10^{-6}&lt;\epsilon_{AGN}&lt;10^{-4}$ and jet coupling efficiencies ($\epsilon_{jet}=\dot{E}_{out}/P_{jet}$) from $10^{-3}&lt;\epsilon_{AGN}&lt;10^{-2}$. A linear regression including the six QSO2s follows the locus of $\epsilon_{jet}\sim$0.1\%. Our results provide evidence that AGN-driven jets/winds disturb the molecular gas kinematics and excitation within the central kpc of the galaxies. The coupling between compact jets and the ISM might be relevant to AGN feedback, even in the case of radio-quiet galaxies, which are more representative of the AGN population. Finally, we find that the warm and cold molecular gas phases seem to be tracing the same outflow, with the main distinction between them being the mass they carry, while the warm ionized outflows do not seem to be another face of the same outflow, as they show different orientation, velocity, and radius.

  We investigate the effect of the environment on the infrared and radio emission of cluster galaxies during the transition epoch at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 when they first start to quench consistently in the majority of galaxy clusters. We considered a sample of 129 cluster member galaxies from 11 massive clusters at a confirmed redshift of 1.0-1.8 from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS), the IRAC Distant Cluster Survey (IDCS), and new 3 GHz images from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We calculated the IR-radio correlation slope parameter, q, in order to identify differences in the ratios of IR to radio of cluster galaxies and field galaxy comparison samples at different redshifts. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) were identified and analyzed to search for any effect on the IR-radio correlation. The correlation parameter values were also compared by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with field galaxies. Our comparison of the IR-radio correlation in cluster galaxies to the control sample of field galaxies reveals a marginally to modestly significant difference in the correlation slope parameter at the ~2sigma-3sigma level. A split of the clusters into low-redshift (1 &lt; z &lt; 1.37) and high-redshift (1.37 &lt; z &lt; 1.8) bins indicates a more significant difference in the correlation parameter in the lower redshift cluster subsample, where widespread quenching begins. We find no difference in the IR-radio correlation between galaxies that host AGNs and non-active star-forming galaxies either. This suggests that our AGNs are overwhelmingly radio quiet and therefore do not affect the results we described above. We conclude that further investigations based on larger datasets are needed to constrain the impact of the cluster environment on the IR-radio correlation better.

  We utilized the Edelson and Malkan (2012) and Stern et al. (2012) selection techniques and other methods to identify AGN candidates that were monitored during the Kepler prime and K2 missions. Subsequent to those observations, we obtained 125 long-slit optical spectra with the Lick 3-m telescope, 58 spectra with the Palomar 5-m telescope, and three with the Keck 10-m telescope to test these identifications. Of these 186 AGN candidates, 105 were confirmed as Type 1 AGN and 35 as Type 2 AGN, while the remaining 46 were found to have other identifications (e.g., stars and normal galaxies). This indicated an overall reliability of about 75%, while the two main methods had much higher reliability, 87%-96%. The spectra indicated redshifts out to z = 3.4. Then, we examined the AGN sample properties through the Baldwin, Phillips &amp; Terlevich diagram and compared the AGN's spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with those from the literature. We found that our sample yielded the same AGN population as those identified through other methods, such as optical spectroscopy.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However, understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying spectral 'doppelg\"angers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width, velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.

  Galaxy groups and clusters are one of the best probes of structure formation and growth in a cosmological context. Most of their baryonic component is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), whose thermodynamical properties serve as indicators of the halo's dynamical state and can be used for the halo mass determination in the self-similar scenario. However, baryonic processes, such as AGN feedback and gas cooling, may affect the global properties of the ICM, especially in the group regime. These effects might lead to deviations from self-similar predictions in galaxy groups' scaling relations, while they remain in place for massive galaxy clusters. Additionally, the low-mass end of the scaling relations, ranging from $10^{13}$ to $10^{14} M_\odot$, remains unclear and poorly populated, as current X-ray surveys detect only the brightest groups. Here, we present the Mass-Temperature relation across the full mass range, from massive clusters to low-mass groups ($10^{13}M_\odot$), as observed by eROSITA. Using spectral stacking from eROSITA eRASS1 data for optically selected galaxy groups, we find that, in the lower mass range, galaxy groups follow the power-law relation known for galaxy clusters. We further validate these results by conducting the same stacking procedure on mock eRASS:4 data using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation. This indicates that AGN feedback is more likely to affect the distribution of baryons in the intragroup medium rather than the overall halo gas temperature. No significant changes in the Mass-Temperature relation slope suggest that temperature can serve as a reliable mass proxy across the entire mass range. This validates the use of temperature-derived masses, particularly in cosmological studies, significantly broadening the mass range and enabling applications such as improving the cluster mass function studies and cosmological parameter estimates.
