We present new MIRI F560W, F770W and F1000W imaging of GN-z11, extending the previous rest-frame coverage from 0.38 to 0.86$μ$m. We report significant detections (14$σ$) in the F560W and F770W images, and a marginal detection (3.2$σ$) in F1000W. Here, we analyse its SED combining new MIRI imaging data with archival NIRSpec/Prism and MRS spectroscopy, and NIRCam imaging. The continuum emission shows a flat energy distribution, in f$_ν$, up to 0.5$μ$m, compatible with the presence of a mixed stellar population of young (4$\pm$1 Myr) and mature (63$\pm$23 Myr) stars that also account for the [O III], H$β$ and H$α$ emission lines. The continuum at rest-frame 0.66$μ$m shows a 36$\pm$3% flux excess above the predicted flux for a mixed stellar population, pointing to the presence of an additional source contributing at these wavelengths. This excess increases to 91$\pm$28% at rest-frame 0.86$μ$m, although with a large uncertainty due to the marginal detection in the F1000W filter. We consider that hot dust emission in the dusty torus around a type 2 AGN could be responsible for the observed excess. Alternatively, this excess could be due to hot dust emission or to a photoluminiscence dust process (Extended Red Emission, ERE) under the extreme UV radiation field, as observed in some local metal-poor galaxies and in young compact starbursts. The presence of a type 1 AGN is not supported by the observed SED since high-z QSOs contribute at wavelengths above rest-frame 1$μ$m, and an additional ad-hoc red source would be required to explain the observed flux excess at 0.66 and 0.86$μ$m. Additional deep MIRI imaging covering the rest-frame near-IR are needed to confirm the flux detection at 10$μ$m with higher significance, and to discriminate between the different hot dust emission in the extreme starburst and AGN scenarios with MIRI imaging at longer wavelengths.

We present the quasar catalog from Data Releases 10 to 12 of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Quasar Survey, comprising quasars observed between September 2021 and June 2024. We robustly identified $11,346$ quasars, of which $5,386$ are newly discovered objects not present in the Million Quasars catalog. This release brings the total number of quasars identified by the 12-year LAMOST survey to $67,521$, of which $29,513$ are newly discovered. While the absolute flux calibration for LAMOST quasar spectra from Data Releases 6 to 9 was previously performed using the SDSS/PanSTARRS1 multi-band photometric data, the inherent variability of quasars can affect the flux accuracy. To address this limitation, we recalibrated the LAMOST spectra using (quasi-)simultaneous photometric data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has conducted high-cadence sky monitoring since March 2018. Based on the recalibrated single-epoch spectra, we estimated the emission line fluxes, continuum fluxes, and virial black hole masses. These improved spectra facilitate direct comparison with the spectra of common quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), enabling searches for rare quasars, such as changing-look quasars exhibiting the appearance or disappearance of broad emission lines and broad absorption line quasars. The combined dataset of photometry and multi-epoch spectra will enhance the detections of AGN-related transients, such as Bowen fluorescence flares and extreme variability quasars, thereby improving our understanding of quasar variability.

We examine the connection between galaxy mergers and the triggering of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using a sample of 614 type 1 AGNs at $z&lt;0.07$, along with a control sample of inactive galaxies matched to the AGNs for comparison. We used tidal features, detected in deep images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey, as direct evidence of recent mergers. We find that the fraction of type 1 AGN hosts with tidal features ($f_T$) is higher for AGNs with higher luminosities and (to a lesser extent) more massive black holes. Specifically, $f_T$ rapidly increases from $0.05\pm0.03$ to $0.75\pm0.13$ as the luminosity of the $[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]$ $λ$5007 emission line ($L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}$), an indicator for bolometric AGN luminosity, increases in the range $10^{39.5}\lesssim L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}/(\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}) \lesssim10^{42.5}$. In addition, $f_T$ increases from $0.13\pm0.03$ to $0.43\pm0.09$ as black hole mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) increases in the range $10^{6.0}\lesssim M_\mathrm{BH}/M_{\odot}\lesssim10^{8.5}$. The fraction $f_T$ also increases with the Eddington ratio, although the trend is less significant compared to that with $L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}$ and $M_\mathrm{BH}$. The excess of $f_T$, defined as the ratio of $f_T$ for AGNs to that of their matched inactive counterparts, exhibits similar trends, primarily increasing with $L_{[\mathrm{O\,{\scriptstyle III}}]}$ and weakly with $M_\mathrm{BH}$. Our results indicate that, in the local Universe, galaxy mergers are the predominant triggering mechanism for high-luminosity AGNs, whereas they play a lesser role in triggering lower-luminosity AGNs. Additionally, strong events, such as galaxy mergers, may be more necessary to activate massive black holes in more massive galaxies due to their lower gas fractions.

Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are AGN seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Despite this, recent mid-infrared spectra of the central 0.5-1.1 kpc of five QSO2s at z~0.1, obtained with the MRS module of JWST/MIRI, revealed 9.7, 18, and 23 micron silicate features in emission in two of them. This indicates that the high angular resolution of JWST/MIRI now allows us to peer into their nuclear region, exposing some of the directly illuminated dusty clouds that produce silicate emission. To test this, we fitted the nuclear mid-infrared spectrum of the QSO2 with the strongest silicate features, J1010, with two different sets of torus models implemented in an updated version of the Bayesian tool {\tt BayesClumpy}. These are the CLUMPY and the CAT3D-WIND models. The CAT3D-WIND model is preferred by the observations based on the marginal likelihood and fit residuals, although the two torus models successfully reproduce the spectrum by means of intermediate covering factors ($\rm C_T=0.45\pm^{0.26}_{0.18}$ and $\rm C_T=0.66\pm^{0.16}_{0.17}$ for the CLUMPY and CAT3D-WIND models) and low inclinations ($\rm i=50^\circ\pm^{8^\circ}_{9^\circ}$ and $\rm i=13^\circ\pm^{7^\circ}_{6^\circ}$). Indeed, four of the five QSO2s with JWST/MIRI observations, including J1010, are in the blowout or ''forbidden'' region of the Eddington ratio-column density diagram, indicating that they are actively clearing gas and dust from their nuclear regions, leading to reduced covering factors. This is in contrast with Seyfert 2 galaxies observed with JWST, which are in the ''permitted'' regions of the diagram and show 9.7 micron silicate features in absorption. This supports a scenario where the more luminous the AGN and the higher their Eddington ratio, the lower the torus covering factor, driven by radiation pressure on dusty gas.

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of compact objects that show a unique V-shaped spectral energy distribution (SED) in the UV and optical wavelength range. These so-called "little red dots" (LRDs) often exhibit broad Balmer emission lines, indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They generally lack detection of X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation, which is fundamentally different from typical AGNs. Various models, including super-Eddington-accreting black holes enshrouded in dense and dust-poor gas, have been proposed to explain these features. However, the nature of LRDs remains debated, and their evolutionary fate is unclear. Here we report two unusual LRDs at redshift z = 2.868 and 2.925 that are in a transitional phase towards typical AGNs. Their V-shaped SEDs, compact optical morphology, and broad emission lines satisfy the defining criteria of LRDs. On the other hand, they exhibit intense X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation that is much stronger than previously known LRDs. These hybrid properties suggest that the dense gas envelope around their central black holes is dispersing, allowing high-energy photons and radio emission to escape. Meanwhile, a dust torus is forming. This finding provides a direct insight into the nature of LRDs and indicates that at least some LRDs will evolve into AGNs or quasars at later times.

We report the discovery of two broad-line X-ray AGNs cid_414 and cid_947 at z~3 that exhibit prominent He I$λ$10830+ Pa$γ$ emission and absorption, identified from the JWST Cycle 3 large GO treasury program COSMOS-3D using NIRCam F444W grism spectroscopy. Additional UV/optical line measurements (e.g., Ly$α$, Si IV, C IV) come from complementary COSMOS-field spectroscopy. Both sources are robustly detected in the mid-infrared, with detections in MIRI F1000W for both AGNs and an additional detection in MIRI F2100W for cid_414, indicating the presence of hot dust emission. The source cid_947 shows a higher He I$λ$10830 absorption column density and X-ray-inferred $N_{\rm H}$, and displays strong outflow signatures in He I, Si IV, and C IV with velocity offsets exceeding 5000 km/s. The source cid_414 shows a narrow Ly$α$ emission line with luminosity $\log L_{\rm Lyα}=42.49\pm0.01~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and a higher intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. Host-galaxy decomposition and multi-component SED fitting indicate that cid_947 hosts a more massive black hole but lower star formation rate than cid_414. From simplified photoionization modeling, we infer that the dense absorbing gas has a characteristic size comparable to the nuclear broad-line region and is likely kinematically coupled to the obscuration associated with the dust torus. He I$λ$1083 absorption has also been identified in several compact little red dots at similar redshifts. Together with the two AGNs reported here, these findings suggest that dense circumnuclear gas are plausibly prevalent at high redshift and plays an important role in regulating AGN obscuration and black hole--host co-evolution.
