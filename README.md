  The Granger causality is an econometric test for determining whether one time series is useful for forecasting another one with a certain Granger lag. Here, the light curves in the 0.3-1 keV (reflection dominated, soft) and 1.2-5 keV (continuum dominated, hard) bands of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are produced, and the Granger lags are estimated and compared to the traditional lag-frequency spectra. We find that the light curves in the hard band Granger-cause (lead) those in the soft band, whereas the obtained Granger lags could be interpreted as the intrinsic reverberation lags. Then, we extract the Granger-lag profiles from 14 XMM-Newton observations of IRAS 13224-3809, and find that the lags are significant in 12 observations. The majority of the obtained Granger (intrinsic) lags are ~ 200-500 s. With the IRAS 13224-3809 mass of 2 $\times 10^6$ $M_{\odot}$, these lags correspond to the true light-travel distance of ~ 20-50 $r_g$. Hence, by assuming a lamp-post geometry and a face-on disc, this places the corona at ~ 10-25 $r_{g}$ above the central black hole. Moreover, multiple Granger lags consisting of the small and large lags of &lt; 500 s and &gt; 1000 s are detected in 4 observations. This means that the corona height can significantly evolve from ~ 10-25 $r_{g}$ to ~ 55 $r_{g}$, or vice versa, towards the end of the observation. Granger lags are a promising way to measure the intrinsic lags, and provide evidence of coronal height variability within each individual observation.

  Astrophysical events that occur in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are believed to differ significantly from the ordinary in the interstellar medium. We show that stars located in the outer region of the AGN disk would explode near the original migration starting points instead of being accreted by the central supermassive black hole due to the effect of viscosity. AGN disks provide a dense environment for supernova (SN) explosions, which inevitably involve ejecta-disk interactions. In this paper, we investigate the light curves (LCs) of core-collapse SN exploded in AGN disks. In addition to the fundamental energy source of $^{56} \mathrm{Ni}$--$^{56} \mathrm{Co}$--$^{56} \mathrm{Fe}$ decay reaction powering the SN LCs, the forward-reverse shock produced during interactions may contribute significantly to the observed flux. If the stellar winds manage to create a cavity surrounded by a shell near the star before the SN explosion, the ejecta-winds-disk configurations are expected. We present various SN LCs from different types of progenitors and find that the SN LCs are dominated by the radiation of ejecta-disk interaction-induced shocks. The resulting SNe in the AGN disk is a promising transient source for UV and optical band detection by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift), the Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) and wide field survey telescopes such as Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite (ULTRASAT), Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) and Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. These detections could aid in the investigation of AGN discs and the associated high-energy transient occurrences.

  Radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) are rare among AGN populations. Lacking high-resolution and high-frequency observations, their structure and evolution stages are not well understood at high redshifts. In this work, we report ALMA 237 GHz continuum observation at $0.023''$ resolution and VLA 44 GHz continuum observation at $0.08''$ resolution of the radio continuum emission from a high-redshift radio and hyper-luminous infrared galaxy at $z=1.92$. The new observations confirm the South-East (SE) and North-West (NW) hotspots identified by previous low-resolution VLA observations at 4.7 and 8.2 GHz and identify a radio core undetected in all previous observations. The SE hotspot has a higher flux density than the NW one does by a factor of 6, suggesting that there can be a Doppler boosting effect in the SE one. In this scenario, we estimate the advance speed of the jet head, ranging from $\sim$0.1c -- 0.3c, which yields a mildly relativistic case. The projected linear distance between the two hotspots is $\sim13$ kpc, yielding a linear size ($\leq20$ kpc) of a Compact-Steep-Spectrum (CSS) source. Combined with new \black{high-frequency ($\nu_\text{obs}\geq44$ GHz) and archived low-frequency observations ($\nu_\text{obs}\leq8.2$ GHz)}, we find that injection spectra of both NW and SE hotspots can be fitted with a continuous injection (CI) model. Based on the CI model, the synchrotron ages of NW and SE hotspots have an order of $10^5$ yr, consistent with the order of magnitude $10^3 - 10^5$ yr observed in CSS sources associated with radio AGNs at an early evolution stage. The CI model also favors the scenario in which the double hotspots have experienced a quiescent phase, suggesting that this RLAGN may have transient or intermittent activities.

  We present a study on the incidence of major mergers and their impact on the triggering of nuclear activity in 47 type I and 236 type II optically-selected AGN from the MaNGA DR15 sample. From an estimate of non-parametric image predictors ($Gini$, M$_{20}$, concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S), S\'ersic index (n), and shape asymmetry($A_S$)) using the SDSS images, in combination with a Linear Discriminant Analysis Method, we identified major mergers and merger stages. We reinforced our results by looking for bright tidal features in our post-processed SDSS and DESI legacy images. We find a statistically significant higher incidence of major mergers of 29\% $\pm$ 3\% in our type I+II AGN sample compared to 22\% $\pm$ 0.8\% for a non-AGN sample matched in redshift, stellar mass, color and morphological type, finding also a prevalence of post-coalescence (51\% $\pm$ 5\%) over pre-coalescence (23\% $\pm$ 6\%) merger stages. The levels of AGN activity among our massive major mergers are similar to those reported in other works using \oiii\ tracers. However, similar levels are produced by our AGN-galaxies hosting stellar bars, suggesting that major mergers are important promoters of nuclear activity but are not the main nor the only mechanism behind the AGN triggering. The tidal strength parameter $Q$ was considered at various scales looking for environmental differences that could affect our results on the merger incidence, finding non-significant differences. Finally, the H-H$\beta$ diagram could be used as an empirical predictor for the flux coming from an AGN source, useful to correct photometric quantities in large AGN samples emerging from surveys.

  Pairs of galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powerful probes of merger-driven supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth as they can resolve individual AGN and trace mergers over a large range of physical separations. To exploit this on a large scale for the first time for both obscured and unobscured AGN, we use photometric redshifts of AGN selected by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to find probabilistic pairs (&lt;100 kpc separations) across the sky, along with a comparison sample of inactive galaxy pairs. Our final sample of integrated pair probabilities yields 198 AGN-AGN pairs (dual AGN) and 2767 AGN-galaxy pairs (offset AGN) with uniformly measured AGN and host galaxy physical properties. We find the fraction of galaxy pairs hosting WISE AGN is dominated by offset AGN and significantly elevated above that of inactive galaxies for large host stellar masses. We show how the AGN merger fraction directly increases with AGN extinction for both offset and dual AGN, with up to ~40% of heavily obscured AGN found in galaxy pairs. Elevated AGN merger fractions coincide with increased host specific star formation rates that suggest merger-driven co-evolution of galaxies and SMBHs. Among dual AGN, the most rapid SMBH growth may occur within the less massive galaxy. Relative to stochastic mechanisms, mergers produce an excess of AGN at increasingly smaller separations, especially for obscured AGN (up to a factor of ~5), and augmented by correlated triggering. Finally, this excess is stronger than for lower luminosity optically-selected AGN, regardless of AGN obscuration level.

  We report on the 2019 XMM-Newton+NuSTAR monitoring campaign of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 2992, observed at one of its highest flux levels in the X-rays. The time-averaged spectra of the two XMM-Newton orbits show Ultra Fast Outflows (UFOs) absorbing structures above 9 keV with $&gt; 3 \sigma$ significance. A detailed investigation of the temporal evolution on a $\sim$5 ks time scale reveals UFO absorption lines at a confidence level $&gt;$95% (2$\sigma$) in 8 out of 50 XMM-Newton segments, estimated via Monte Carlo simulations. We observe a wind variability corresponding to a length scale of 5 Schwarzschild radii $r_S$. Adopting the novel Wind in the Ionised Nuclear Environment (WINE) model, we estimate the outflowing gas velocity ($v=0.21-0.45 c$), column density ($N_H=4-8\cdot 10^{24} cm^{-2}$) and ionisation state ($\log(\xi_0/erg\ cm\ s^{-1})=3.7-4.7$), taking into account geometrical and special relativity corrections. These parameters lead to instantaneous mass outflow rates $\dot{M}_{out}\simeq0.3-0.8 M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$, with associated outflow momentum rates $\dot{p}_{out}\simeq 20-90 L_{Bol}/c$ and kinetic energy rates $\dot{E}_K \simeq 2-25 L_{Bol}$. We estimate a wind duty cycle $\approx$ 12% and a total mechanical power $\approx$ 2 times the AGN bolometric luminosity, suggesting the wind may drive significant feedback effects between the AGN and the host galaxy. Notably, we also provide an estimate for the wind launching radius and density $\approx 5 r_S, 10^{11} {cm}^{-3}$, respectively.
