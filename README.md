  Work by the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) collaboration found higher molecular gas surface densities and velocity dispersions in the centres of barred galaxies compared to unbarred galaxies. We explore central molecular gas using published high resolution (150 pc) measurements of CO$(2-1)$ from the PHANGS-ALMA survey and a new velocity dispersion-dependent prescription for the CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$. Comparisons of the molecular gas surface density, velocity dispersion, star formation rate, and depletion time reveal that these quantities are different in the centres of barred and unbarred galaxies. Gas depletion times are found to be shorter in barred galaxy centres. Even when we control for the presence of an AGN, the velocity dispersion and depletion time are found to be statistically different between barred and unbarred galaxy centres. The higher velocity dispersion suggests extra non-circular motions, possibly due to the inflow of gas along the bar, that are not constant but must increase as the star formation rate increases.

  We investigate graph-based representations of astronomical light curves for transient classification on the MANTRA benchmark. Each series is mapped to three visibility-graph views-horizontal (HVG), directed (DHVG), and weighted (W-HVG)-from which we extract compact, length-aware network descriptors (degree/strength moments, clustering and motifs, assortativity, path/efficiency, and spectral summaries). Using stratified five-fold validation and tree-based learners, the best configuration (LightGBM with HVG+DHVG+W-HVG features) attains a macro-F1 of 0.622 +/- 0.010 and accuracy of 0.661 +/- 0.010, improving over the MANTRA baseline (F1 macro = 0.528). Ablations show that weighted contrasts and directed asymmetry contribute complementary gains to undirected topology. Per-class analysis highlights strong performance for CV, HPM, and Non-Tr., with residual confusions concentrated in the AGN-Blazar-SN block. These results indicate that visibility graphs offer a simple, survey-agnostic bridge between irregular photometric time series and standard classifiers, yielding competitive multiclass performance without bespoke deep architectures. We release code and feature definitions to facilitate reproducibility and future extensions.

  We present the ionised gas properties and metallicity gradients of 43 galaxies observed by the MEGADES survey. Using the MEGARA (Multi-Espectrografo en GTC de Alta Resolucion para Astronomia) instrument, our data combine relatively high spectral (R ~ 6000) and spatial (0.62 arcsec) resolution to study the ionised gas through classic BPT diagnostics in the [N II] and [S II] variants. We examine how these diagrams vary with radius and with the velocity dispersion of the H-alpha line, and we propose a new diagnostic based on the ratio between the velocity dispersions of the [N II] 6584 and H-alpha lines to disentangle the relative roles of AGN, shocks and H II regions. Many regions, regardless of galactocentric distance, show shock-like emission, inferred from their line ratios (high [N II]6584/H-alpha and intermediate [O III]5007/H-beta) and their location between H II and AGN regimes. This improved selection of H II-like regions enables robust oxygen abundance estimates using the N2 indicator. Most galaxies show negligible metallicity gradients, especially low-abundance (&lt;8.37 dex) fast rotators, with an average slope of 0.005 dex Re^-1 and a dispersion of 0.42 dex Re^-1. Above 8.37 dex, fast rotators display mildly negative gradients (mean -0.68 dex Re^-1, dispersion 0.93). For the full MEGADES sample, the mean gradient is -0.03 dex Re^-1 with a dispersion of 0.77. We discuss the implications for the influence of galactic winds on abundance gradients.

  The IceCube neutrino observatory has been successfully operating in its full configuration for almost 15 years and is characterized by a remarkably high stability and uptime. During this time, it has made many groundbreaking observations, such as the first detection of a high-energy diffuse cosmic neutrino flux or, more recently, the identification of the AGN NGC1068 as a steady source of high-energy neutrino emission and the observation of neutrinos from the Milky Way. In this talk, new developments in these areas will be discussed and further highlights presented. The second part then looks at the ongoing developments at the South Pole with IceCube Upgrade and IceCube-Gen2 and discusses their potential for advancing neutrino and astroparticle physics.

  Active galactic nucleus (AGNs) feedback is widely accepted as the key mechanism to suppress cooling flows in galaxy clusters. However, the dependence of heating efficiency on jet properties is not fully understood. In this work, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster, including both single-jet and self-regulated models, to investigate how jet density affects bubble evolution and the thermal balance of the intracluster medium. Our results confirm previous findings that lighter jets inflate more spherical bubbles and are more easily deflected by cold gas, enabling isotropic energy deposition throughout the cluster core. However, despite their broader spatial impact, lighter jets display lower overall heating efficiency, requiring higher average jet power to maintain self-regulation compared to heavier jets. We also find that the distribution and amount of cold gas significantly influence the effectiveness of jet heating. These results highlight jet density as a critical parameter in AGN feedback and emphasize the need to incorporate additional physical processes such as magnetic fields, viscosity, and cosmic rays in future studies for realistic comparisons with observations.

  In astrophysical systems like X-ray binaries (XRBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), and young stellar objects (YSOs), we often observe a very fundamental structure called accretion discs(ADs). Conventional AD theory usually supposes that the gravitational field is controlled by a central compact object. This assumption breaks down when the mass of the disc becomes considerable in contrast to that of the massive central object. In these cases, the AD's self-gravity (SG) can drastically change its structure, dynamics, and evolution. This review investigates how SG influences the radial and vertical structure of ADs and how it modifies the mechanisms that transport angular momentum (AM). Along with these, this review also tries to explore how gravitational instabilities (GIs) evolve and how they affect disc fragmentation and astrophysical phenomena like stellar and planetary formation, AGN dynamics, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

  Variability studies are a powerful tool for studying the structures of unresolved sources. One such type of variability study, called reverberation mapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission, which demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the accretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a corresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the surrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been learned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of a potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust outflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how AGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50% of energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in the near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust sublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of the dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the dust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar outflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to high-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated from the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and ground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed modeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the distribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to the accretion disk luminosities.   

Probing down to early cosmic epochs using limited redshift ($z\lesssim

  We present a detailed analysis of AGN identification diagnostics and host galaxy evolution using optical spectral diagnostics using ESO-GOODS-S data. We employ traditional Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams along with their modern extensions, the Mass-Excitation (MEx) and Colour-Excitation (CEx) diagrams, to classify AGNs from among up to 600+ candidates. We extract the spectral properties utilising an indigenous spectral fitting code. In addition, the code also incorporates inputs from a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis model (Bruzual and Charlot, 2003, MNRAS, 344, 1000), extracting the host galaxy ages and metallicities as model parameters. Redshift values for all the studied spectra are obtained from the literature. Using these redshift values, we are able to assign a 'lookback time' (using standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters). When this lookback time is combined with the galaxy ages (from spectral fitting), it enables us to study galaxy evolution even up to early cosmological epochs ($\sim$13 Gyr), despite restricting the studied field of galaxies to $z\sim 1$ (lookback time of $\sim$8 Gyr). We conclude that galaxies ultimately evolving into AGN hosts originate earlier ($\sim$8 Gyr ago) than non-AGN host galaxies ($\sim$6 Gyr ago). We relate this fact, that AGN hosts date back to an earlier epoch than non-AGN galaxies, as being likely due to higher cosmic temperatures at that time, probably enhancing black hole accretion. We emphasise that host galaxy age is an additional crucial parameter (apart from cosmological redshift) in defining our understanding of AGN and star formation co-evolution across cosmological time scales.

  Over the past decade, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected a few hundreds of high-energy (HE) neutrinos from cosmic sources. Despite numerous studies searching for their origin, it is still not known which source populations emit them. A few confident individual associations exist with active galactic nuclei (AGN), mostly with blazars which are jetted AGN whose jet points in our direction. Nonetheless, on a population level, blazar-neutrino correlation strengths are rather weak. This could mean that blazars as a population do not emit HE neutrinos, or that the detection power of the tests is insufficient due to the strong atmospheric neutrino background. By assuming an increase in HE neutrino emission during major blazar flares, in our previous studies we leveraged the arrival time of the neutrinos to boost the detection power. In this paper we utilize the same principle while substantially increasing the number of blazars. We search for the spatio-temporal correlation of 356 IceCube HE neutrinos with major optical flares of 3225 radio- and 3814 $\gamma$-ray-selected blazars. We find that, despite the increase in data size, the number of confident spatio-temporal associations remains low and the overall correlation strengths weak. Two individual associations drive our strongest and the only $&gt;$2$\sigma$ post-trial spatio-temporal correlation, occurring with the BL Lac objects of the radio-selected blazar sample. We estimate that $\lesssim$8\% of the detected cosmic neutrinos were emitted by blazars during major optical flares. As a complementary analysis, we compare the synchrotron peak frequency, redshift, Doppler factor, X-ray brightness, and optical variability of spatially neutrino-associated blazars to those of the general blazar population. We find that spatially neutrino-associated blazars of the tested samples have higher than average Doppler factor and X-ray brightness.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are some of the brightest and most variable objects in the universe. Those with relativistic jets observed at small viewing angles are blazars. Due to Doppler-boosting, blazars exhibit extreme stochastic variability. While the origin of this variability is thought to be changes in the accretion flow and jet dynamics, much about blazar variability remains unknown. In this paper we use several blazar-dominated AGN samples to form a catalog of 7918 blazars and candidates -- the largest to date. We also collect source types, redshifts, spectral energy distribution (SED) peak frequencies, radio variability Doppler factors, and X-ray flux densities for as many sources as possible. We use all-sky surveys (CRTS, ATLAS, and ZTF, abbreviated as ``CAZ'') to extract their optical multiband flux density on a nightly basis between 2007 and 2023, and construct as long and as high cadence light curves as possible for as many sources as attainable. The catalog and its light curves are provided in the accompanying electronic tables, enabling many analyses involving AGN variability with unprecedented sample-sizes. We quantify the variability of the light curves, and apply the Bayesian blocks algorithm to determine their flaring periods. We find: (1) optical flares generally have a faster rise than decay; (2) optical brightness and variability are strongly dependent on the synchrotron peak frequency; (3) flat spectrum radio quasars and BL Lac objects have comparable optical variability and flare characteristics at the same synchrotron peak frequency; and (4) optical flare times tend to decrease and amplitudes increase with increasing radio variability Doppler factor.   

How Fast Could Supermassive Black Holes Grow At the Epoch of
  Reionization?

  Utilizing cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we show that there is a brief super-Eddington accretion phase in typical halos at high redshift, impervious to AGN self-regulation. However, once having attained a black hole mass of $10^4-10^5\msun$, AGN feedback process can self-regulate to guide the SMBHs to grow at a significantly slower, sub-Eddington rate. By redshift $z\sim 10$ the black hole mass with an initial super-Eddington jump-start is caught up by that in the case with a steady Eddington limited case. Thus a continuous Eddington limit case represents the fastest possible route to maximally grow SMBHs. To account for the observed $z=7-10$ quasars with supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses, our analysis establishes firmer ground for the need of seed masses of $10^4-10^5\msun$ that are not grown via an earlier super-Eddington phase.   

A UV to X-Ray View of Soft Excess in Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei. II.
  Broadband Correlations

  The physical origin of soft X-ray excess (SE) is a long lasting question, with two prevailing theories -- ``warm corona'' and ``ionized reflection'' -- dominating the discussion. In the warm corona scenario, SE originates from upscattered disk photons and should therefore correlate strongly with UV emission. Conversely, in the ionized reflection scenario, SE arises from the illumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona and should primarily correlate with the hard X-ray primary continuum (PC). In this second paper of the series, we investigate the correlations among SE, UV and PC, leveraging a sample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs compiled in \citet{Chen+2025a}. Our extensive analysis reveals a strong intrinsic correlation between SE and UV that remains robust after controlling for PC ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim 10^{-7}$). In contrast, the correlation between SE and PC is weaker but still statistically significant ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-2}$). These findings suggest that, in addition to ionized reflection -- a natural outcome of the hot corona illuminating the disk -- a warm corona component is essential, and may even dominate, in producing the soft excess. Additionally, we report a mild anti-correlation between SE strength ($q$) and PC photon index ($\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$) ($p_\mathrm{null}=10^{-2}$), suggesting a potential competition between the warm and hot coronae. Finally, we find that the $\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$ values we derived with SE properly incorporated exhibit a much weaker correlation with $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ ($p_\mathrm{null}=2\times 10^{-2}$) than previously reported in the literature. This highlights the critical role of accurately modeling SE in studies of the $\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$--$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ relation.

  We present bolometric corrections, as a function of wavelength, for powerful radio-loud quasars from the Revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Galaxies (3CRR) at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2. The bolometric luminosities are derived by integrating the intrinsic accretion disk spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the range 1{\mu}m-10keV (excluding reprocessed infrared emission) and integrating over inclination angles (to account for accretion disk emission anisotropy). We use accretion disk models, fitted to observed data, to self-consistently bridge the unobserved wavelength region between the UV and X-rays with no need for far-UV gap repair. The resulting bolometric corrections span a wide range (~1-400) across different wavelengths, showing minimal dependence on redshift, X-ray luminosity, and black hole mass, which is possibly due to a narrow range of these intrinsic AGN parameters in the sample. However, when the sample is divided by Eddington ratio, the X-ray bolometric corrections exhibit distinctly different values, with higher correction factors corresponding to higher Eddington ratios. We also examine the connection between total radio luminosity and accretion disk power. For most 3CRR sources, the radio power constitutes roughly 1%-10% of the accretion disk luminosity. However, quasars with compact jets exhibit higher radio luminosities for a given accretion disk power. This suggests a higher efficiency of conversion of accretion power to radio luminosity in the younger jets. Our results provide physically motivated bolometric corrections for powerful radio quasars that are applicable to powerful radio-loud quasars at any epoch.

  To fully characterize the formation and evolution of galaxies, we need to observe their stars, gas, and dust on resolved spatial scales. We present the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST survey, which combines kpc-resolved imaging and spectroscopy from HST, JWST, and ALMA for 18 representative main-sequence galaxies at z=4-6 and log(M/$M_\odot$) &gt; 9.5 to study their star formation, chemical properties, and extended gas reservoirs. The co-spatial measurements resolving the ionized gas, molecular gas, stars, and dust on 1-2 kpc scales make this a unique benchmark sample for the study of galaxy formation and evolution at z~5, connecting the Epoch of Reionization with the cosmic noon. In this paper, we outline the survey goals and sample selection, and present a summary of the available data for the 18 galaxies. In addition, we measure spatially integrated quantities (such as global gas metallicity), test different star formation rate indicators, and quantify the presence of H$\alpha$ halos. Our targeted galaxies are relatively metal rich (10-70% solar), complementary to JWST samples at lower stellar mass, and there is broad agreement between different star formation indicators. One galaxy has the signature of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on its emission line ratios. Six show broad H$\alpha$ emission suggesting type 1 AGN candidates. We conclude with an outlook on the exciting science that will be pursued with this unique sample in forthcoming papers.

  We present a reverberation mapping analysis of the coronal line [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 emitting region of the quasar COS168 (SDSS J095910.30+020732.2). [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 is known as one of the "coronal lines," which are a species of emission lines present in AGN spectra with high ionization potentials ($\geq$ 100 eV) that can serve as tracers for AGN activity. The spatial extent of the coronal line region has been studied with only spatial resolving techniques that are not sensitive to the innermost regions of AGN. Through our reverberation mapping analysis of [Ne V]$\lambda$3427, we measure a nominal `optimal emission radius' for [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 of $381.1^{+16}_{-22}$ light days (observed-frame). We place the coronal line region in context with other AGN regions by comparing it with the characteristic radius of H$\alpha$, the dust-sublimation radius, and the dusty torus. The coronal line region is located at a larger radius from the black hole than the characteristic radius of the dusty torus, measured using a torus-radius luminosity relationship. The virial product ($v^2 R/G$) of both H$\alpha$ and [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 is consistent within the uncertainties, implying that the coronal line region, as probed by the [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 line, may be in a virialized orbit that is dominated by the gravitational potential of the black hole. This plausibly suggests that coronal lines could be an effective method for estimating black hole masses.
