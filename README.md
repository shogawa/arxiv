  Jets of energetic particles, as seen in FR type-I and FR type-II sources, ejected from the center of Radio-Loud AGN affect the sources surrounding intracluster medium/intergalactic medium. Placing constraints on the age of such sources is important in order to measure the jet powers and determine the effects on feedback. To evaluate the age of these sources using spectral age models, we require high-resolution multi-wavelength data. The new sensitive and high-resolution MIGHTEE survey of the XMM-LSS field along with data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) provide data taken at different frequencies with similar resolution, which enables us to determine the spectral age distribution for radio loud AGN in the survey field. In this study we present a sample of 28 radio galaxies with their best fitting spectral age distribution analyzed using the Jaffe-Perola (JP) model on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Fits are generally good and objects in our sample show maximum ages within the range of 2.8 Myr to 115 Myr with a median of 8.71 Myr. High-resolution maps over a range of frequencies are required to observe detailed age distributions for small sources and high-sensitivity maps will be needed in order to observe fainter extended emission. We do not observe any correlation between the total physical size of the sources and their age and we speculate both dynamical models and the approach to spectral age analysis may need some modification to account for our observations.

  We report a 325(-7, +8) day quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the X-ray emission of the blazar Mkn 421, based on data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The QPO is seen prominently in the ASM data (at least 15 cycles), due to the fact that it has had near-continuous sampling for more than a decade. The PCA data, where the sampling is not uniform and shows many large gaps, provide supporting evidence at lower significance. This QPO is present in both the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) and All-Sky Monitor (ASM) light curves, however it is far more secure (32 sigma significance) in the ASM data since much of the PCA data are from target-of-opportunity flare observations and thus have substantial gaps. QPOs are an important observable in accretion disks, can be modulated by various orbital timescales, and may be generated by a number of mechanisms. They have been studied extensively in X-ray binaries, and should be present in active galactic nuclei (AGN) if they are governed by a common set of physical principles. In jetted sources, QPOs can probe jet-disk interactions or helical oscillations. This QPO previously has been claimed intermittently in X-ray, radio and gamma-ray data, but the continuous, 15-year extent (1996-2011) of the ASM observations (in which Mkn 421 is the brightest AGN observed) provides a unique window. The QPO appears present for nearly the entire extent of the ASM observations. We explore various physical origins and modulating mechanisms, particularly interpretations of the QPO as a result of disk-jet interactions, either due to an accretion disk limit cycle, jet instabilities or helical motions. Limit-cycle related oscillations would not interact with either Keplerian or Lense-Thirring modulated oscillations, however those associated with jet instabilities or helical motions in the jet would likely be modulated by Lense-Thirring precession.

  Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) are transition galaxies showing evidence of recent rapid star formation quenching. To understand the role of galaxy mergers in triggering quenching, we investigate the incidence of PSBs and resolved PSB properties in post-merger galaxies using both SDSS single-fiber spectra and MaNGA resolved IFU spectra. We find post-mergers have a PSB excess of 10 - 20 times that relative to their control galaxies using single-fiber PSB diagnostics. A similar excess of ~ 19 times is also found in the fraction of central (C)PSBs and ring-like (R)PSBs in post-mergers using the resolved PSB diagnostic. However, 60% of the CPSBs + RPSBs in both post-mergers and control galaxies are missed by the single-fiber data. By visually inspecting the resolved PSB distribution, we find that the fraction of outside-in quenching is 7 times higher than inside-out quenching in PSBs in post-mergers while PSBs in control galaxies do not show large differences in these quenching directions. In addition, we find a marginal deficit of HI gas in PSBs relative to non-PSBs in post-mergers using the MaNGA-HI data. The excesses of PSBs in post-mergers suggest that mergers play an important role in triggering quenching. Resolved IFU spectra are important to recover the PSBs missed by single-fiber spectra. The excess of outside-in quenching relative to inside-out quenching in post-mergers suggests that AGN are not the dominant quenching mechanism in these galaxies, but that processes from the disk (gas inflows/consumption and stellar feedback) play a more important role.

  The Gaia-Multi-Peak (GMP) technique can identify large numbers of dual or lensed active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates at sub-arcsec separation, allowing us to study both multiple super-massive black holes (SMBH) in the same galaxy and rare, compact lensed systems. The observed samples can be used to test the predictions of the models of SMBH merging once 1) the selection function of the GMP technique is known, and 2) each system has been classified as dual AGN, lensed AGN, or AGN/star alignment. Here we show that the GMP selection is very efficient for separations above 0.15" when the secondary (fainter) object has magnitude G&lt;20.5. We present the spectroscopic classification of five GMP candidates using VLT/ERIS and Keck/OSIRIS, and compare them with the classifications obtained from: a) the near-IR colors of 7 systems obtained with LBT/LUCI, and b) the analysis of the total, spatially-unresolved spectra. We conclude that colors and integrated spectra can already provide reliable classifications of many systems. Finally, we summarize the 14 confirmed dual AGNs at z&gt;0.5 selected by the GMP technique, and compare this sample with other such systems from the literature, concluding that GMP can provide a large number of confirmed dual AGNs at separations below 7 kpc.
