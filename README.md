  Stars are likely to form or to be captured in AGN disks. Their mass reaches an equilibrium when their rate of accretion is balanced by that of wind. If the exchanged gas is well mixed with the stellar core, this metabolic process would indefinitely sustain an "immortal" state on the main sequence (MS) and pollute the disk with He byproducts. This theoretical extrapolation is inconsistent with the super-solar {\alpha} element and Fe abundances inferred from the broad emission lines in active AGNs with modest He concentration. We show this paradox can be resolved with a highly-efficient retention of the He ashes or the suppression of chemical blending. The latter mechanism is robust in the geometrically-thin, dense, sub-pc regions of the disk where the embedded-stars' mass is limited by the gap-formation condition. These stars contain a radiative zone between their mass-exchange stellar surface and the nuclear-burning core. Insulation of the core lead to the gradual decrease of its H fuel and the stars' equilibrium masses. These stars transition to their post-main-sequence (PostMS) tracks on a chemical evolution time scale of a few Myr. Subsequently, the triple-{\alpha} and {\alpha}-chain reactions generate {\alpha} and Fe byproducts which are released into their natal disks. These PostMS stars also undergo core collapse, set off type II supernova, and leave behind a few solar-mass residual black holes or neutron stars

  We present the results of a size and structural analysis of 1395 galaxies at $0.5 \leq z \lesssim 8$ with stellar masses $\log \left(M_* / M_{\odot}\right)$ $&gt;$ 9.5 within the JWST Public CEERS field that overlaps with the HST CANDELS EGS observations. We use GALFIT to fit single S\'ersic models to the rest-frame optical profile of our galaxies, which is a mass-selected sample complete to our redshift and mass limit. Our primary result is that at fixed rest-frame wavelength and stellar mass, galaxies get progressively smaller, evolving as $\sim (1+z)^{-0.71\pm0.19}$ up to $z \sim 8$. We discover that the vast majority of massive galaxies at high redshifts have low S\'ersic indices, thus do not contain steep, concentrated light profiles. Additionally, we explore the evolution of the size-stellar mass relationship, finding a correlation such that more massive systems are larger up to $z \sim 3$. This relationship breaks down at $z &gt; 3$, where we find that galaxies are of similar sizes, regardless of their star formation rates and S\'ersic index, varying little with mass. We show that galaxies are more compact at redder wavelengths, independent of sSFR or stellar mass up to $z \sim 3$. We demonstrate the size evolution of galaxies continues up to $z \sim 8$, showing that the process or causes for this evolution is active at early times. We discuss these results in terms of ideas behind galaxy formation and evolution at early epochs, such as their importance in tracing processes driving size evolution, including minor mergers and AGN activity.

  In order to understand observable signatures from putative cosmic-ray (CR) sources in-source acceleration of particles, their energy and time-dependent transport including interactions in an evolving environment and their escape from source have to be considered, in addition to source-to-Earth propagation. We present the code CR-ENTREES (Cosmic-Ray ENergy TRansport in timE-Evolving astrophysical Settings) that evolves the coupled time- and energy-dependent kinetic equations for cosmic-ray nucleons, pions, muons, electrons, positrons, photons and neutrinos in a one-zone setup of (possibly) non-constant size, with user-defined particle and photon injection laws. All relevant interactions, particle/photon escape and adiabatic losses are considered in a radiation-dominated, magnetized astrophysical environment that is itself evolving in time. Particle and photon interactions are pre-calculated using event generators assuring an accurate interactions and secondary particle production description. We use the matrix multiplication method for fast radiation and particle energy transport which allows also an efficient treatment of transport non-linearities due to the produced particles/photons being fed back into the simulation chain. Examples for the temporal evolution of the non-thermal emission from AGN jet-like systems with focus on proton-initiated pair cascades inside an expanding versus straight jet emission region, are further presented.   

Magnetized Accretion Disks with Outflows for Changing-look AGNs

  Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) challenges the standard accretion theory owing to its rapid variability. Recent numerical simulations have shown that, for the sub-Eddington accretion case, the disk is magnetic pressure-dominated, thermally stable, and geometrically thicker than the standard disk. In addition, outflows were found in the simulations. Observationally, high blueshifted velocities absorption lines indicate that outflows exist in AGNs. In this work, based on the simulation results, we investigate the magnetic pressure-dominated disk, and find that the accretion timescale is significantly shorter than that of the standard thin disk. However, such a timescale is still longer than that of the CL-AGNs. Moreover, if the role of outflows is taken into account, then the accretion timescale can be even shortened. By the detailed comparison of the theoretical accretion timescale with the observations, we propose that the magnetic pressure-dominated disk incorporating outflows can be responsible for the rapid variability of CL-AGNs.

  In the manuscript, we study the efficiency of pair creation by means of the centrifugal mechanism. The strong magnetic field and the effects of rotation, which always take place in Kerr-type black holes, guarantee the frozen-in condition, leading to the generation of an exponentially amplifying electrostatic field. This field, when reaching the Schwinger threshold, leads to efficient pair production. The process has been studied for a wide range of AGN luminosities and black hole masses, and it was found that the mechanism is very efficient, indicating that for AGNs where centrifugal effects are significant, the annihilation lines in the MeV range will be very strong.   

A complete catalogue of merger fractions in AGN hosts: No evidence for
  an increase in detected merger fraction with AGN luminosity

  Despite the importance of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution, the mechanisms that fuel AGN activity remain poorly understood. Theoretical models suggest that major mergers of galaxies contribute strongly to AGN fuelling, particularly at high AGN luminosities. The connection between mergers and AGN activity has therefore been widely studied, although with contradictory results. Some studies find a strong connection between mergers and AGN, while others find merger fractions in AGN hosts to match those in the inactive galaxy population. To address these apparent contradictions, I present a complete and systematic analysis of detected merger fractions in AGN hosts from the literature. I assess if discrepancies between studies are indicative of systematic uncertainties and biases and analyse the detected merger fraction as a function of luminosity, redshift, and AGN selection method. X-ray selected AGN samples show comparable detected merger fractions across studies and major mergers do not dominate triggering in this AGN population. On the other hand, signatures of significant merger contribution to the AGN population are observed in a small fraction of primarily radio selected and reddened AGN samples. It is unclear if this is due to observational biases or physical differences in the host galaxies. There is no correlation between the detected merger fraction and AGN luminosity. This lack of correlation between detected merger fraction and AGN luminosity, which has previously been reported in the literature, cannot be explained by systematic uncertainties and observational biases.
