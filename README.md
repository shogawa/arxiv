  We evaluate the underlying assumptions for the identification of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) through near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting out to z ~ 3. For massive galaxies, log(M) &gt; 9.5, our high resolution spectra of the rest optical range generally confirm the results of SED fitting, which relies primarily on excesses above the stellar emission between 1 and 6 microns to identify AGN. However, the method is undermined if the redshift used for the SED fitting is incorrect. Low mass galaxies, log(M) &lt; 9:5, can contain relatively warm dust that emits in the 4 - 6 micron range. We show that the potential contamination of AGN samples by purely star forming low-mass galaxies can be avoided by the use of the infrared properties of Haro 11 as a limiting star-forming SED template. However, relatively few star forming galaxies emit as strongly in the 3 - 6 micron range as this template, so this could result in missing some obscured AGNs to avoid a minor contamination. Including the behavior of the galaxies at rest lamda ~ 13.5 microns can mitigate this problem and yield more complete samples of bona fide AGN. JWST/MIRI supports this approach out to z ~ 0.6.

  Optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, such as the classical BPT, are widely used to identify ionisation mechanisms in galaxies but often suffer from degeneracies, especially when multiple sources coexist. We critically evaluate the effectiveness of these diagnostics in distinguishing star-forming galaxies, retired galaxies (RGs), and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and propose refined methods to reduce misclassifications. Using a large sample of nearby galaxies from the NASA-Sloan Atlas cross-matched with SDSS spectroscopy, we define representative subsamples of late-type/star-forming galaxies, early-type/RGs, and multiwavelength-selected AGNs. Their distributions are analysed across traditional and modern diagnostics, including WHaN, WHaD, and the newly introduced WHaO diagram, which combine H{\alpha} equivalent width with [N II]/H{\alpha}, {\sigma}(H{\alpha}), and [O III]/[O II], respectively. Quantitative comparisons reveal that classical BPT diagrams overestimate star-forming galaxies by ~10% and misclassify up to 45% of AGNs and nearly all RGs. Diagnostics incorporating EW(H{\alpha}) achieve improved accuracy, reducing misclassifications to {\sim} 20\ % for AGNs and {\sim} 15\% for RGs. A revised classification scheme based on EW(H{\alpha}) thresholds and consistent WHaD/WHaO results yields the highest purity (8-25% misclassifications) and better reflects underlying physical conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that BPT-based methods fail to reliably separate ionisation mechanisms, particularly in galaxies hosting weak AGNs or evolved stellar populations. Updated EW(H{\alpha})-based diagnostics offer a more accurate framework for studying galaxy ionisation and should replace traditional schemes in future population studies.

  We present a systematic reassessment of 5,062 high-Galactic latitude gamma-ray sources from the Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalog using Firmamento, a web-based platform for multi-frequency source discovery and analysis. Our goal is to provide an independent evaluation of LAT gamma-ray source associations through alternative spectral and spatial methods that combine recent and legacy survey data, supplemented by human supervision of spectral energy distributions (SEDs), source morphology, flux variability, and template-based comparisons. Firmamento confirms the 4FGL-DR4 and 4LAC-DR3 counterparts or unassociated sources in 4,493 cases (88.8%), demonstrating the robustness of both approaches. Beyond this general agreement, we identify 421 new blazar counterparts among previously unassociated sources, thereby reducing the fraction of unidentified extragalactic Fermi-LAT sources from 25% to 17%. In addition, in 64 cases we find alternative blazar associations, while in 49 instances we do not confirm the 4FGL-DR4 association. For all confirmed blazar counterparts we provide homogeneous estimates of synchrotron peak frequency and peak flux using machine-learning and template-based methods; these agree with 4LAC-DR3 values in most cases, though significant discrepancies appear for a few dozen sources, often due to improved X-ray coverage. The primary outcome of this work is the 1st Firmamento LAT AGN table (1FLAT), made publicly available through the Firmamento platform (https://firmamento.nyuad.nyu.edu), where all related multi-wavelength data and images are available. The project involved extensive manual validation and benefited from the active participation of graduate and undergraduate students, highlighting the platform's value for both research and education.

  We present new broad-band X-ray results aimed at the identification and characterization of four poorly studied hard X-ray transients discovered by INTEGRAL: IGR J16426+6536, IGR J09446-2636, IGR J21268+6203, and IGR J02447+7046. The key properties and X-ray behavior of these sources have remained largely unknown until now. We investigated the temporal, spectral, and energetic characteristics of their hard X-ray outbursts detected above 20 keV by INTEGRAL. In addition, we performed a systematic analysis of unpublished archival soft X-ray observations below 10 keV, enabling a full exploration of their large INTEGRAL error circles in search of the most likely soft X-ray counterparts. Within their arcsecond-sized X-ray error circles, we identified single optical/near-infrared counterparts for each source. We analyzed their photometric properties to constrain the nature of the systems. Our results show that the X-ray properties of these four transients are inconsistent with the previously proposed extragalactic AGN origin, and instead support a Galactic nature for all of them. Specifically, we propose a very faint X-ray transient classification for IGR J16426+6536, a nearby flaring star for IGR J09446-2636 and IGR J21268+6203, finally a gamma-ray binary nature for IGR J02447+7046.

  (Abridged)We explore the potential of optical variability selection methods to identify AGN, including those challenging to detect with conventional techniques. Using the unprecedented combination of depth, sky coverage, and cadence of the ZTF survey, we target even starlight-dominated AGN, known for their redder colours, weaker variability signals, and difficult nuclear photometry due to their resolved hosts. We perform aperture photometry on ZTF reference-subtracted images for 40 million sources across 8,000 deg^2, assemble light curves and classify objects employing an RF algorithm into 14 classes, including 341,938 candidate AGN. We compare variability metrics derived from our photometry to those obtained from ZTF Data Release light curves (DR11-psf), to assess the impact of our analysis. We find that the fraction of low-z quiescent galaxies exhibiting significant variability drops dramatically (from 98\% of the sample to 7\%) when replacing the DR11-psf light curves with our difference image, aperture photometry (DI-Ap) version. The overall number of variable low-z AGN remains high (99\% when using DR11-psf lightcurves, 83\% when using DI-Ap), however, implying that our photometry can detect the fainter variability in host dominated AGN. The classifier effectively distinguishes between AGN and other sources, demonstrating high recovery rates even for AGN in resolved nearby galaxies. AGN candidates in eROSITA's eFEDS field, detected in X-rays and bright enough for ZTF optical observations, were classified as AGN (79\%) and non-variable galaxies (20\%). These groups show a 2 dex difference in X-ray luminosity but not in X-ray flux. A significant fraction of X-ray AGN are optically too faint for ZTF, and conversely, a quarter of ZTF AGN in the eFEDS area lack X-ray detections, highlighting a wide range of X-ray-to-optical flux ratios in AGN.

  We present the first systematic search for "changing-look" ("CL") behavior in the broad He ii {\lambda}4686 emission line in quasars, utilizing repeated spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The He ii line, originating from high-ionization gas and powered by extreme ultraviolet photons, serves as a sensitive tracer of changes in the ionizing continuum. After applying strict spectral selection criteria and visual inspection to a parent sample of over 9,000 quasars with multi-epoch spectra, we identify a sample of 34 He ii "changing-look" quasars that show a significant appearance or disappearance of the broad He ii {\lambda}4686 line. Compared with previously known H\{beta} "CL" quasars, the He ii "CL" sample exhibits similarly strong continuum variability and broad-line flux changes, yet shows a preference for higher Eddington ratios and lower host-galaxy contamination. These results highlight the value of He ii line in studying the central variable engines of AGNs and uncovering a more complete census of extreme quasar variability. A comparison with H\{beta} "CL" further underscores the profound selection biases inherent in "changing-look" studies, especially those associated with line strength, host-galaxy contamination, and spectral signal-to-noise ratio.

  Both jets and ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to play important roles in affecting the star formation and evolution of host galaxies, but their relationship is still unclear. As a pilot study, we performed a detailed spectral analysis for a radio-loud (RL) AGN 3C~59 ($z=0.1096$) by systematically considering various factors that may affect the fitting results, and thereby establishing a general spectral fitting strategy for subsequent research with larger sample. 3C~59 is one rare target for simultaneously studying jets and warm absorbers (WAs) that is one type of ionized outflows. Based on the multi-wavelength data from near-infrared (NIR) to hard X-ray bands detected by DESI, GALEX, and XMM-Newton, we used SPEX code to build broadband continuum models and perform photoionization modeling with PION code to constrain the physical parameters of WAs in 3C~59. We found two WAs with ionization parameter of $\log [\xi/(\rm{erg\ cm\ s}^{-1})] = 2.65^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ and $1.65\pm 0.11$, respectively, and their outflowing velocities are $v_{\rm out} = -528^{+163}_{-222}\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$ and $-228^{+121}_{-122}\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$, respectively. These WAs are located between outer torus and narrow (emission-)line region, and their positive $v_{\rm out}$-$\xi$ relation can be explained by the radiation-pressure-driven mechanism. We found that the estimations of these physical properties are affected by the different spectral fitting strategies, such as the inclusion of NIR to ultra-violet data, the choice of energy range of spectrum, or the composition of the spectral energy distribution. Based on the same fitting strategy, this work presents a comparative study of outflow driven mechanism between a RL AGN (3C 59) and a radio-quiet AGN (NGC 3227), which suggests a similar driven mechanism of their WA outflows and a negligible role of jets in this process.

  We present integral field spectroscopy of ionized gas components in AGC 111629, an edge-on low surface brightness galaxy (LSBG) with a stellar mass of 5.7$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. AGC 111629 displays an irregular H$\alpha$ morphology and an arch-like structure in the extraplanar region, which is absent in continuous stellar image. The irregular H$\alpha$ morphology may be related to a past merger event with its satellite galaxy AGC 748815. A peanut-shaped structure at the center in the integrated [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map, with a position angle that differs from that of the main stellar disk. This structure exhibits a higher [OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ flux ratio, a larger equivalent width (EW) of [OIII]$\lambda$5007, and a lower H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux radio ($&lt;$ 2.86). Some spaxels associated with the peanut-shaped structure fall within the composite region of the BPT diagram based on [NII]$\lambda$6583. These features may be associated with the central AGN. Additionally, a sub-peak in the southern disk is clearly visible in the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map. An extended region ($\sim$ 2 kpc) with an extremely low value of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux ratio is observed near this sub-peak. We interpret the sub-peak as a superbubble likely driven by supernova explosions in the southern disk. We derive the gas-phase metallicity, 12+log(O/H), using the [NII]$\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ diagnostic and find that AGC 111629 exhibits low central metallicity. This may result from feedback associated with AGN activity and supernova explosions.

  The Little Red Dot (LRD) paradigm comprises three main unknowns that are intrinsically connected: (1) What is the nature of these sources? (2) How do they form? (3) How do they evolve? Larger spectroscopic samples and high-resolution data are needed to delve deeper into the mechanisms ruling these sources. Understanding their formation and evolution requires identifying the rise and fall of the key features that characterize these systems, such as their compactness and ``V''-shaped spectral energy distributions. In this work, we present a galaxy system nicknamed The Stingray that was identified in the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). This group contains three sources at $z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 5.12$, including an active galactic nucleus (AGN), a Balmer break galaxy, and a star-forming satellite. The latter resembles a Building Block System in which interactions boost stellar mass and black hole mass growth beyond what is expected from secular processes alone. The AGN in this system exhibits features indicative of a transitional object, bridging a normal AGN and an LRD phase. These are a blue rest-frame ultraviolet slope, compact size, and a broad H$\alpha$ line (all of which are characteristic of LRDs), but a flatter rest-frame optical slope compared to that observed in LRDs. The features in this source point to the emergence or fading of an LRD, potentially triggered by environmental effects.
