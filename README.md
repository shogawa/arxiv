  We report a new population of objects discovered using the data from the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by their point-like morphology and narrow permitted emission lines. Our sample includes nine objects found in three JWST wide survey fields, which have z=3.624 to 5.378 and M_B ~ -18.3 to -21.4 mag. Their light distributions follow gaussian profiles, with the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values only 3.7%--34.6% larger than those of the point spread functions. Their sharpest FWHM sizes correspond to only 0.49 to 0.96 kpc. They have very strong [O III] and Halpha lines (median rest-frame equivalent widths of 1610.6 and 1374.0 A, respectively), and the line widths of the latter are only 150--360 km/s. Due to the limitation of the current data, the exact nature of this new population is still uncertain. The emission line diagnostics shows that at least one object is consistent with being AGN. On the other hand, the spectral energy distributions of most of the nine objects can be fitted reasonably by normal galaxy templates, which suggest that they could also be very young (median age of 120 Myrs), star-forming (median star formation rate of 1.8 Msun/yr) galaxies in the early formation stage (having acquired a median stellar mass of only 10^{8.4} Msun). If they are indeed star-forming galaxies, their gas-phase metallicities range from 12+log(O/H) = 7.8 to 8.3. It will be critical to understand this population by deeper medium-resolution spectroscopy in the future. If they are AGNs, they constitute a new kind of type 2 AGNs that are low-luminosity and almost "hostless". If they are star-forming galaxies, they also constitute a new kind whose early formation is likely a secular process starting from a very compact core, which is in line with the picture of a monolithic collapse.

  The gas-phase metallicity distribution in galaxies provides significant information on their evolution. We report the discovery of negative radial gradients in the gas-phase metallicity of the narrow-line region of the nine galaxies in the Measuring Active Galactic Nuclei Under MUSE Microscope (MAGNUM) galaxies: Centaurus A, Circinus, IC 5063, NGC 1068, NGC 1365, NGC 1386, NGC 2992, NGC 4945, NGC 5643. From strong-line abundance relations for active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming regions, along with emission-line ratio diagnostics, we determine spatially resolved gas-phase metallicities for the kinematic components, galaxy disc and outflow. These relations involve sensitive strong emission lines, specifically [O III]5007, [N II]6584, H{\alpha}, H\b{eta}, [S II]6716, and [S II]6731. The existence of predominantly negative radial metallicity gradients in these AGN host galaxies indicates that metals are not necessarily moved from the central regions to the outskirts by AGN activity and that the gas-phase metallicity in galaxies may follow the general inside-out star formation scenario.

  Scaling relations between galactic parameters represent key pieces of evidence for investigating the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. In most studies, these relations have been obtained for large portions of the galaxies (i.e., on kpc scales), but it is also important to evaluate these relations in smaller scales. In this work, we used optical data cubes of a subsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to analyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar velocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These correlations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all morphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic bars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies. It is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar mass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show younger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the central regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star formation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their nuclear stellar populations are younger than expected. This may be a consequence of positive AGN feedback, triggering star formation. Conversely, starburst galaxies do not show nuclear stellar populations at ages over one billion years.   

Simulations of Tidal Disruption of Supernova in Galaxy Nuclear Region: A
  Novel Model for Ambiguous Nuclear Transients

  An increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients, including some extreme nuclear transients, have been reported, which cannot be simply explained by the tidal disruption event (TDE) due to their high energy and/or overmassive black holes. Stars that form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk disappears during the phase of AGN decay. We propose that tidal disruption of a supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear transients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by the SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta, which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington limit for SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$, while it remains sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity \(\gtrsim10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}\) in galaxies with $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{8}\,M_\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.   

Active galactic nuclei do not exhibit stably periodic brightness
  variations

  Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) light curves has been proposed as a signature of close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Recently, 181 candidate SMBH binaries were identified in Gaia DR3 based on periodicity in their $\sim$1000-day light curves. By supplementing Gaia photometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the reported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that in all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model fails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than periodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false positives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false detections. We conclude that truly periodic AGN are exceedingly rare, with at most a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting stable periodicity on 100 to 1000 day timescales. Models predict that the Gaia AGN light curve sample should contain dozens of true SMBH binaries with periods within the observational baseline, so the lack of strictly periodic light curves in the sample suggests that most short-period binary AGN do not have light curves dominated by simple periodicity.
