  JWST observations have opened a new chapter in studies of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), stimulating discussion of two puzzles: the abundance of SMBHs in the early Universe and the fraction of dual AGNs. In this paper we argue that the answers to these puzzles may be linked to an interpretation of the data on the nHz gravitational wave (GWs) discovered by NANOGrav and other Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in terms of SMBH binaries losing energy by interactions with their environments as well as by GW emission. According to this interpretation, the SMBHs in low-$z$ AGNs are the tip of the iceberg of the local SMBH population, which are mainly in inactive galaxies. This interpretation would favour the observability of GW signals from BH binaries in LISA and deciHz GW detectors.

  Green Peas (GPs) are young, compact, star-forming dwarf galaxies, and local (z~0.3) analogues of the early galaxies (z&gt;6) considered to be mainly responsible for the reionisation of the Universe. Recent X-ray observations of GPs have detected high excess emission which cannot be accounted for by star formation alone, and implies presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We employ radio observations to study the radio properties of GPs, build their radio spectral energy distributions, and verify the presence of AGNs. We performed new radio observations of three GPs with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) in the L, C, and X bands (1.4, 6 and 10 GHz resp.), supplemented by the data from archival observations and large radio surveys. We also analysed the archival radio data for a larger sample of GPs and blueberry (BBs) galaxies, which are lower-mass and lower-redshift analogues of the GPs. To understand the significance of the radio observations, we assess the detectability of these sources, and compare the detected radio luminosities with the expectations from theoretical and empirical relations. Two of the three targeted GPs were strongly detected ($&gt;10\sigma$) in the JVLA observations and their fluxes are consistent with star formation, while the third source was undetected. Although a large fraction (~75%) of the sources from the larger archival sample of GPs and BBs could be detected with archival surveys, only a small number (&lt;40%) are detected and their radio luminosity is significantly lower than the expectation from empirical relations. Our results show that the majority of the dwarf galaxy sample is highly underluminous. Especially towards the lower end of galaxy mass and star formation rate (SFR), the radio luminosity-SFR relation deviates from the empirical relations, suggesting that the relations established for larger galaxies may not hold towards the low-mass end.

  The origin of a compact millimeter (mm, 100-250 GHz) emission in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGN) remains debated. Recent studies propose a connection with self-absorbed synchrotron emission from the accretion disk X-ray corona. We present the first joint ALMA ($\sim$100 GHz) and X-ray (NICER/XMM-Newton/Swift; 2-10 keV) observations of the unobscured RQ AGN, IC 4329A ($z = 0.016$). The time-averaged mm-to-X-ray flux ratio aligns with recently established trends for larger samples (Kawamuro et al. 2022, Ricci et al. 2023), but with a tighter scatter ($\sim$0.1 dex) compared to previous studies. However, there is no significant correlation on timescales of less than 20 days. The compact mm emission exhibits a spectral index of $-0.23 \pm 0.18$, remains unresolved with a 13 pc upper limit, and shows no jet signatures. Notably, the mm flux density varies significantly (factor of 3) within 4 days, exceeding the contemporaneous X-ray variability (37% vs. 18%) and showing the largest mm variations ever detected in RQ AGN over daily timescales. The high amplitude variability rules out scenarios of heated dust and thermal free-free emission, pointing toward a synchrotron origin for the mm radiation in a source of $\sim$1 light day size. While the exact source is not yet certain, an X-ray corona scenario emerges as the most plausible compared to a scaled-down jet or outflow-driven shocks.}

  The atomic-to-molecular gas conversion is a critical step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, which sets the initial conditions for subsequent star formation and influences the multi-phase interstellar medium. We compiled a sample of 94 nearby galaxies with observations of multi-phase gas contents by utilizing public H I, CO, and optical IFU data from the MaNGA survey together with new FAST H I observations. In agreement with previous results, our sample shows that the global molecular-to-atomic gas ratio ($R_{\rm mol} \equiv$ log $M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\rm H\ I}$) is correlated with the global stellar mass surface density $\mu_*$ with a Kendall's $\tau$ coefficient of 0.25 and $p &lt; 10^{-3}$, less tightly but still correlated with stellar mass and NUV$-$ r color, and not related to the specific star formation rate (sSFR). The cold gas distribution and kinematics inferred from the H I and CO global profile asymmetry and shape do not significantly rely on $R_{\rm mol}$. Thanks to the availability of kpc-scale observations of MaNGA, we decompose galaxies into H II, composite, and AGN-dominated regions by using the BPT diagrams. With increasing $R_{\rm mol}$, the fraction of H II regions within 1.5 effective radius decreases slightly; the density distribution in the spatially resolved BPT diagram also changes significantly, suggesting changes in metallicity and ionization states. Galaxies with high $R_{\rm mol}$ tend to have high oxygen abundance, both at one effective radius with a Kendall's $\tau$ coefficient of 0.37 ($p &lt; 10^{-3}$) and their central regions. Among all parameters investigated here, the oxygen abundance at one effective radius has the strongest relation with global $R_{\rm mol}$, but the dependence of gas conversion on gas distribution and galaxy ionization states is weak.

  We present 6-GHz Very Large Array radio images of 70 gravitational lens systems at 300-mas resolution, in which the source is an optically-selected quasar, and nearly all of which have two lensed images. We find that about in half of the systems (40/70, with 33/70 secure), one or more lensed images are detected down to our detection limit of 20microJy/beam, similar to previous investigations and reinforcing the conclusion that typical optically-selected quasars have intrinsic GHz radio flux densities of a few microJy ($\sim10^{23}$WHz$^{-1}$) at redshifts of 1--2. In addition, for ten cases it is likely that the lensing galaxies are detected in the radio. Available detections of, and limits on the far-infrared luminosities from the literature, suggest that nearly all of the sample lie on the radio-FIR correlation typical of star-forming galaxies, and that their radio luminosities are at least compatible with the radio emission being produced by star formation processes. One object, WISE2329$-$1258, has an extra radio component that is not present in optical images, and is difficult to explain using simple lens models. In-band spectral indices, where these can be determined, are generally moderately steep and consistent with synchrotron processes either from star-formation/supernovae or AGN. Comparison of the A/B image flux ratios at radio and optical wavelengths suggests a 10 per cent level contribution from finite source effects or optical extinction to the optical flux ratios, together with sporadic larger discrepancies that are likely to be due to optical microlensing.
