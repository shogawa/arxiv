  We investigate the stellar shape and size-mass relationship of X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using the high-angular resolution and deep sensitivity in the near-infrared of the COSMOS-Web JWST survey field. We present the rest-frame 1-$\mu m$ size, stellar mass, Sersic index, axis-ratio, Gini-$M_{20}$ parameters of 690 moderate luminosity AGNs between redshift 0-3 and with stellar mass $\log M_s\sim 10.75$. We find that AGN host galaxies have an effective radius of 1-5 kpc, which is between star-forming (SFG) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) of the same stellar mass. AGN hosts have similar size-mass trends as SFG and QGs, being smaller at higher redshift for the same stellar mass. The slope of the size-mass relationship of AGN host galaxies is steeper than that of star-forming galaxies. Their rest-frame 1$\mu m$ stellar morphology indicates a significant spheroidal component. We observed a low merger fraction (6%) in our sample as well as substructures similar to disks, bars, and spiral arms in the residual images, which are in tension with evolutionary pathways that require major mergers. However, it may also be due to the different timescales between mergers and AGN activity.

  Reflection of X-rays at the inner accretion disk around black holes imprints relativistically broadened features in the observed spectrum. Besides the black hole properties and the ionization and density of the accretion disk the features also depend on the location and geometry of the primary source of X-rays, often called the corona. We present a fast general relativistic model for spectral fitting of a radially extended, ring-like corona above the accretion disk. A commonly used model to explain observed X-ray reflection spectra is the lamp post, which assumes a point-like source on the rotational axis of the black hole. While often being able to explain the observations, this geometric model does not allow for a constraint on the radial size of the corona. We therefore extend the publicly available relativistic reflection model RELXILL by implementing a radially extended, ring-like primary source. With the new RELXILL model allowing us to vary the position of the primary source in two dimensions, we present simulated line profiles and spectra and discuss implications of data fitting compared to the lamp post model. We then apply this extended RELXILL model to XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the radio-quiet Seyfert-2 AGN ESO 033-G002. The new model describes the data well, and we are able to constrain the distance of the source to the black hole to be less than three gravitational radii, while the angular position of the source is poorly constrained. We show that a compact, radially extended corona close to the ISCO can explain the observed relativistic reflection equally well as the point-like lamp post corona. The model is made freely available to the community.

  Mean motion resonances (MMRs) are a generic outcome of convergent migration for bodies embedded in accretion disks around a central mass. Long studied in planetary systems, the same phenomenon should occur for stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in AGN disks. In this work, we derive simple analytic criteria describing when BH pairs are driven out of resonance, and use them to chart MMR stability across AGN parameter space, accounting for disruption from general-relativistic apsidal precession, hydrodynamic turbulence, and stellar stirring. Across plausible AGN disk models, we find three MBH mass regimes: (i) for $M/ M_\odot\gtrsim 10^{7.5}$, first order resonances are generically unstable; (ii) for $M/ M_\odot\lesssim 10^{6.5}$, stable MMRs are always present; (iii) for $10^{6.5}\lesssim M / M_\odot \lesssim 10^{7.5}$, stability depends on disk mass flux, the summed mass of the orbiters, and the nuclear-cusp slope. When present, stable MMRs commonly occur between an inner anti-trap and an outer trap set by thermal torque, a region where embedded objects migrate outward in the disk. These results imply that high-mass AGN allow convergent migration to proceed to LVK-band mergers largely without resonant chains, whereas low/intermediate-mass AGN can host MMRs, with the potential to reshape merger pathways.
