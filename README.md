  Jets emanating from active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent some of the most formidable particle accelerators in the universe, thereby emerging as viable candidates responsible for the detection of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). If AGN jets indeed serve as origins of UHECRs, then the diffuse flux of these cosmic rays would be dependent on the power and duty cycle of these jets, which are inherently connected to the nature of black hole accretion flows. In this article, we present our cosmological semi-analytic framework, JET(Jets from Early Times), designed to trace the evolution of jetted AGN populations. This framework serves as a valuable tool for predictive analyses of cosmic ray energy density and, potentially, neutrino energy density. By using JET, we model the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) from z = 20 to z = 1, incorporating jet formation and feedback mechanisms and distinguishing between various accretion states determined by the SMBH Eddington ratios. The implications of different SMBH growth models on predicting cosmic ray flux are investigated. We provide illustrative examples demonstrating how the associated diffuse UHECR fluxes at the source may vary in relation to the jet production efficiencies and the selected SMBH growth model, linking cosmological models of SMBH growth with astroparticle backgrounds.

  HSC 120505.09-000027.9 (J1205$-$0000) is one of the highest redshift ($z=6.72$) dust-reddened quasars (red quasars) known to date. We present an improved analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of the [CII] $158\ \rm{\mu m}$ line and the underlying rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) continuum emission, previously reported in Izumi et al. (2021a), toward J1205$-$0000. Red quasars are thought to be a transitional phase from an obscured starburst to a luminous blue quasar, in some cases associated with massive outflows driven by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). J1205$-$0000 has a high FIR luminosity, $L_{\mathrm{FIR}}=2.5\times 10^{12}\ L_{\odot}$ and a total IR luminosity of $L_{\mathrm{TIR}}=3.5\times 10^{12}\ L_{\odot}$, corresponding to a star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim 528\ M_{\odot}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. With the [CII]-based dynamical mass of $\sim 1 \times 10^{11}~M_\odot$, we conclude that J1205$-$0000 is hosted by a starburst galaxy. In contradiction to Izumi et al. (2021a), our improved analysis shows no hint of a broad component in the [CII] line spectrum. Thus there is no evidence for a host galaxy-scale fast [CII] outflow, despite the fact that J1205$-$0000 has fast nuclear ionized outflows seen in the rest-frame UV. We explore several scenarios for this discrepancy (e.g., early phase of AGN feedback, reliability of the [CII] line as a tracer of outflows), and we claim that it is still too early to conclude that there is no significant negative AGN feedback on star formation in this red quasar.
