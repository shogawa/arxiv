  We investigate the role of galactic bars in fuelling and triggering Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in disc galaxies up to $z\sim 0.8$. We utilise a Deep Learning model, fine-tuned on Galaxy Zoo volunteer classifications, to identify (strongly and weakly) barred and unbarred disc galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program $i$-band images. We select AGN using three independent diagnostics: mid-infrared colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The SED analysis, performed using CIGALE, quantifies the relative AGN contribution to the total galaxy luminosity ($f_{\rm AGN}$) and the AGN luminosity ($L_{\rm disc}$). We assess the impact of bars by comparing AGN incidence and properties in barred galaxies against carefully constructed redshift-, stellar mass-, and colour-matched unbarred control samples. Our binary AGN classification experiment demonstrates that barred disc galaxies host a statistically detectable higher fraction of AGN compared to their unbarred counterparts, suggesting a contributing role for bars in the global AGN budget. The contribution of bars to AGN fuelling appears confined to systems where the AGN has a lower relative contribution to the host galaxy's emission ($f_{\rm AGN} &lt; 0.75$). Crucially, we find a significant dearth of barred disc galaxies hosting AGN with $f_{\rm AGN} &gt; 0.75$, independent of bar strength. Consistent with this, the fraction of barred galaxies among AGN hosts decreases with increasing $L_{\rm disc}$. Combined with previous results, we suggest that bars contribute to fuelling the population of low-to-moderate luminosity AGN, but major mergers are the principal mechanism for triggering the most powerful and dominant accretion events.

  We measure and analyze the inflows and outflows of mass, energy, and metals through the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies in the IllustrisTNG100 simulations. We identify the dominant feedback mechanism in bins of halo virial mass and redshift by computing the integrated energy input from SNe and the ``kinetic'' and ``thermal'' mode of AGN feedback. We measure all quantities in a shell at the virial radius (``halo scale'') and one chosen to be approximately at the interface of the CGM and the interstellar medium (ISM; ``ISM scale''). We find that galaxies have strong net positive inflows on halo scales, and weaker but still net positive inflows on ISM scales, at $z\gtrsim 2$. At later times, partially due to the onset of kinetic AGN feedback in massive halos, inflows and outflows nearly balance one another, leading to the familiar effects of the slow-down of galaxy growth and the onset of quenching. Halos dominated by SN feedback show only weak evidence of preventative feedback on halo scales, and we see excess ISM scale accretion indicative of rapid gas recycling. Wind mass loadings decrease with increasing halo mass, and with increasing redshift, while energy loadings are nearly independent of both mass and redshift. The detailed catalogs of these mass, metal, and energy inflow and outflow rates on galaxy and halo scales can be used to guide empirical and semi-analytic models, and provide deeper insight into how galaxy growth and quenching is regulated in the IllustrisTNG simulations.

  We present spatially resolved mass outflow rates of the ionized and molecular gas in the narrow line region of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3227. Using long-slit spectroscopy and [O III] imaging from from Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, in conjunction with Cloudy photoionization models and emission line diagnostics, we find a peak ionized mass outflow rate of $\dot M_{\text{ion}} =$ $19.9\pm9.2$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of $47\pm6$ pc from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using archival data from the Gemini-North Near-infrared Field Spectrograph measuring H$_2$ $\lambda2.1218$ $\mu$m emission, we find a maximum peak warm molecular outflow rate of $\dot M_{\mathrm{H_2}} \le 9 \times 10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of $36\pm6$ pc from the SMBH. Using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array measuring CO(2-1) emission, we find a maximum peak cold molecular gas mass outflow rate of $\dot M_{\mathrm{CO}} \le$ $23.1$ M$_\odot$ year$^{-1}$ at a distance of $57\pm6$ pc from the SMBH. For the first time, we calculate spatially resolved gas evacuation timescales for the cold molecular gas reservoirs ostensibly sourcing the outflows, and find that evacuating gas to $\sim$400 pc from the SMBH occurs on timescales of $10^{6.0} - 10^{7.6}$ years. These results indicate that the multi-phase AGN outflows are effective in clearing the inner few hundred parsecs of NGC 3227's gas content on timescales that may set the AGN duty cycle of $10^5 - 10^8$ years.   

Revisiting the 150 MHz Radio Luminosity Function of Star-Forming

  We present a comprehensive analysis of the 150~MHz radio luminosity function (LF) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using deep observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey in the ELAIS-N1, Bo\"{o}tes, and Lockman Hole fields. Our sample comprises $\sim$56,000 SFGs over $0 &lt; z &lt; 5.7$. We first analyze the deepest field (ELAIS-N1), then jointly model all three fields while accounting for their distinct flux limits and selection functions. Using adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE), we reconstruct the LF continuously across redshift and luminosity without binning or parametric assumptions. The KDE results reveal clear signatures of joint luminosity and density evolution (LADE). Motivated by this, we construct and fit three parametric models--pure luminosity evolution (PLE) and two LADE variants--using a full maximum-likelihood method that includes completeness corrections and constraints from the local radio LF and Euclidean-normalized source counts (SCs). Model selection using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria strongly favors LADE over PLE. For ELAIS-N1, the more flexible LADE model (Model C) provides the best fit, while for the combined fields, the simpler Model B balances fit quality and complexity more effectively. Both LADE models reproduce the observed LFs and SCs across luminosity and flux density ranges, whereas PLE underperforms. We also identify a mild excess at the bright end of the LF, likely due to residual AGN contamination. This study demonstrates that combining KDE with parametric modeling offers a robust framework for quantifying the evolving radio LF of SFGs, paving the way for future work with next-generation surveys like the SKA.

  SDSSJ1539+3954 ($z\approx 1.935$), a radio-quiet weak-line quasar (WLQ), exhibited exceptional X-ray variability in 2019$-$2020, with its X-ray flux increasing by over 20 times from 2013 to 2019 and subsequently dropping by at least a factor of nine in 2020. Motivated by the empirical correlations between X-ray and radio emission in AGN cores, we carried out a follow-up radio study in the 0.3$-$10 GHz range using GMRT (2020, 2022, 2024) and VLA (2022), and analyzed archival VLASS 3 GHz data (2017-2023) to investigate the source's radio properties and potential connection with the X-ray behavior. Our observations reveal a compact radio source with a spectral index of -0.65$\pm$0.15 in the frequency range of 0.3$-$1.4 GHz and -1.09$\pm$0.16 in 3$-$10 GHz. While the source was undetected in VLA-FIRST (1994) and VLASS epochs, the GMRT and VLA observations show no statistically significant variability over the monitored period. The absence of detectable changes in the radio flux, despite strong X-ray variability, suggests no direct connection between the X-ray variability and the radio emission, consistent with the Thick-Disk plus Outflow (TDO) model for WLQs. However, the sensitivity limit of the surveys prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions regarding longer timescale variability between the VLA-FIRST and GMRT epochs. We further explore possible mechanisms driving the radio emission from this source. Our analysis rules out small-scale jets and coronal emission as the primary drivers of the radio emission, suggesting that extended emission from AGN winds and star formation is the more plausible mechanism.

  We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray emission of the Compton-thick (CT) AGN ESO 137-G034 based on deep ($\sim230$ ks) Chandra observations. As in other CT AGNs, the morphology of the emission is elongated, approximately following the [O III] ionization bicone. With spatially resolved spectral modeling, we show that the extended emission within the bi-cone regions { is most readily explained} as from a mixture of photo-ionized gas and shock-heated plasma, reflecting the combined effects of radiative and kinematic AGN feedback. By comparing the morphology of the { X-ray emission in narrow spectral bands and that of the 3 cm radio jet, we find suggestive evidence of thermal, possibly shocked emission associated with the SE termination of the radio jet. This interpretation is also supported by the lack of [O III] relative to the $0.3-3.0$ keV flux in the inner $3^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim600$ pc) of the SE cone, which would be consistent with an additional thermal X-ray component on top of the photonized emission of an outflowing wind. A similar effect is only seen within the inner $1^{\prime\prime}$ ($200$ pc) of the NW cone. In the radial profile of the [OIII]/X-ray flux ratio and the X-ray hardness ratio within the inner $\sim3^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim600$ pc) of the SE cone we see an asymmetry, with no counterpart in the NW cone. We detect soft extended X-ray emission in the cross-cones which may originate from the interaction of an embedded radio jet with a clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). }These results highlight the { importance of both} radiative and mechanical feedback in shaping the circumnuclear environment of ESO 137-G034.

  We present a detailed, spatially resolved Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) analysis of ESO 137-G034, a Compton-thick Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), based on narrowband {\it HST} imaging in [O III], [S II], H$\alpha$, and H$\beta$ emission lines. We dissect the Interstellar Medium (ISM) into Seyfert-, LINER-, and H II-dominated regions with a resolution of $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim20$ pc at $z=0.009$). To characterize the fine spatial structure of the { different excitation mechanism}, we introduce a new parameter: the Seyfert/LINER Index (SLI), defined as the perpendicular distance of each point in the BPT diagram from the Seyfert/LINER division line. The narrowband optical emission exhibits a bi-conical morphology and traces the diffuse X-ray emission observed with \textit{Chandra}. Most of the emission within the bi-cones is Seyfert-like, with SLI values consistent with AGN photoionization. The North-West Seyfert cone is surrounded by a $\sim100$--$200$ pc thick LINER cocoon with a smooth, monotonic SLI profile, shaped by either AGN wind-ISM interactions, and/or obscured AGN radiation; three radial SLI peaks suggest episodic nuclear outbursts, with estimated timescales of a few $10^3$ yrs and $&lt;100$ yrs duration. The South-East cone shows inhomogeneous excitation, with a higher SLI region in its inner part, coinciding with a wider region of enhanced soft emission and the radio lobe inner edge. This region is characterized by line ratios consistent with fast shocks ($&gt;1000$ km s$^{-1}$) induced excitation. The LINER cocoon in the SE cone appears more irregular, with inter-cone LINER points likely shaped by both local ISM structure and shocks. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of different AGN feedback mechanisms in the ISM.

  We present an analysis of the rest frame optical JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit spectra of extended host galaxy emission in 12 quasars from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) sample at redshifts 6.0 &lt; z &lt; 6.4. The spatial point spread function is modeled primarily by a sum of two Gaussians as a function of wavelength and is used to fit and subtract the quasar from the 2D spectra, leaving only extended galaxy emission which we analyze. Ten of 12 systems show spatially extended line emission and five of 12 systems show an extended stellar continuum. From the extended [OIII]5008 emission line, we measure a 132 ${\pm}$ 19 km/s ionized outflow in one system and 52 ${\pm}$ 12 km/s rotation, suggesting a coherent disk, in another. From the extended narrow H${\alpha}$ emission, which we hypothesize is ionized by star-forming regions rather than the quasar, we measure star formation rates ranging from ${\sim}$ 7 to 111 M${_\odot}$/yr, the majority of which are consistent with the star-forming main sequence at z ${\approx}$ 6. The positions of our host galaxies on the log10[OIII]5008/H${\beta}$ vs. log10[NII]6584/H${\alpha}$ (R3N2) Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram indicate ionization rates typical of AGN activity in the low-redshift universe, but are consistent with the placement of similar z ${\approx}$ 6 quasar host galaxies, suggesting that the R3N2 line ratios cannot distinguish AGN and star-formation powered line emission at high redshifts. We conclude from the consistency between our quasar host sample with z ${\sim}$ 6 galaxies that the presence of a low-luminosity AGN causes little significant change in the properties of galaxies at z ${\approx}$ 6 on 10 Myr timescales.

  X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rare and enigmatic phenomena that increasingly show a connection to tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy ("Ansky") appear to be linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky's nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power law with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs. Compared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a significantly lower blackbody luminosity (10^43 erg s^-1) and much longer rise and decay timescales, suggesting a distinct TDE subclass. An offset TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole is unlikely, given its position consistent with the galactic center with a 3 sigma upper limit of 54 pc. Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black hole. Our findings strengthen the growing evidence for TDE-QPE associations, although other formation channels for QPEs remain plausible and await future observational efforts.

  Wide-angle tail (WAT) and narrow-angle tail (NAT) radio active galactic nuclei (RAGNs) are key tracers of dense environments in galaxy groups and clusters, yet no machine-learning classifier of bent RAGNs has been trained using both unlabeled data and purely visually inspected labels. We release the RGC Python package, which includes two newly preprocessed labeled datasets of 639 WATs and NATs derived from a publicly available catalog of visually inspected sources, along with a semi-supervised RGC model that leverages 20,000 unlabeled RAGNs. The two labeled datasets in RGC were preprocessed using PyBDSF which retains spurious sources, and Photutils which removes them. The RGC model integrates the self-supervised framework BYOL (Bootstrap YOur Latent) with the supervised E2CNN (E2-equivariant Convolutional Neural Network) to form a semi-supervised binary classifier. The RGC model, when trained and evaluated on a dataset devoid of spurious sources, reaches peak performance, attaining an accuracy of 88.88% along with F1-scores of 0.90 for WATs and 0.85 for NATs. The model's attention patterns amid class imbalance suggest that this work can serve as a stepping stone toward developing physics-informed foundation models capable of identifying a broad range of AGN physical properties.

  Context. It has recently been suggested that angular diameter distances derived from comparing the variability timescales of blazars to angular size measurements with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) may provide an alternative method to study the cosmological evolution of the Universe. Once the intrinsic brightness temperature ($T_{\rm int}$) is known, the angular diameter distance may be found without knowledge of the relativistic Doppler factor, opening up the possibility of a single rung distance measurement method from low $(z_{\rm cos}\ll1)$ to high $(z_{\rm cos}&gt;4)$ redshifts. Aims. We aim to verify whether the variability-based estimates of the intrinsic brightness temperature of multiple active galactic nuclei (AGNs) converges to a common value. We also investigate whether the intrinsic brightness temperature changes as a function of frequency. Methods. We estimated the $T_{\rm int}$ of AGNs based on the flux variability of the radio cores of their jets. We utilized radio core light curves and size measurements of 75 sources at 15 GHz and of 37 sources at 43 GHz. We also derived $T_{\rm int}$ from a population study of the brightness temperatures of VLBI cores using VLBI survey data of more than $100$ sources at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Results. Radio core variability-based estimates of $T_{\rm int}$ constrain upper limits of $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$&lt;11.56$ at 15~GHz and $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$&lt;11.65$ at 43 GHz under a certain set of geometric assumptions. The population analysis suggests lower limits of $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$&gt;9.7$, $9.1$, and $9.3$ respectively at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Even with monthly observations, variability-based estimates of $T_{\rm int}$ appear to be cadence-limited. Conclusions. Methods used to constrain $T_{\rm int}$ are more uncertain than previously thought. However, with improved datasets, the estimates should converge.

  The velocity field of intracluster gas in galaxy clusters contains key information on the virialization of infalling material, the dissipation of AGN energy into the surrounding medium, and the validity of the hydrostatic hypothesis. The statistical properties of the velocity field are characterized by its fluctuation power spectrum, which is usually expected to be well described by an injection scale and a turbulent cascade. Here we propose a simulation-based inference technique to retrieve the properties of the velocity power spectrum from X-ray micro-calorimeter data by generating simulations of Gaussian random fields from a parametric power spectrum model. We forward model the measured bulk velocities and velocity dispersions by including the most relevant observational effects (projection, emissivity weighting, PSF smearing). We then train a neural network to learn the mapping between the power spectrum parameters and the generated data vectors. Considering a three-parameter model describing turbulent energy injection on large scales and a power-law cascade, we found that two XRISM/Resolve pointings are sufficient to accurately determine the turbulent Mach number and set interesting constraints on the injection scale. Applying our method to the Coma cluster data, we obtain a model that is characterized by a large injection scale that rivals the size of the cluster ($\ell_{inj}=2.2_{-1.0}^{+2.0}$ Mpc). When this power spectrum model is integrated over the cluster scales ($0&lt;\ell&lt;R_{500}=1.4 $Mpc), the Mach number of the gas motions is $\mathcal{M}_{3D,500}=0.45_{-0.13}^{+0.18}$, which exceeds the value derived from the velocity dispersions only. Further observations covering a wider area are required to decrease the cosmic variance and constrain the slope of the turbulent cascade.

  Binary black holes (BBHs) in the vicinity of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are particularly interesting systems from both a cosmological and astrophysical point of view. Matter and radiation fields within the dense AGN environment could produce electromagnetic and neutrino emission in addition to gravitational waves (GWs). Moreover, interactions between BBHs and AGN accretion disks are expected to influence BBH formation channels and merger rates. Understanding these sources could help explain the unexpectedly high BBH masses observed through GWs by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. We present a search for coincident gravitational-wave and neutrino emission from AGNs. Our innovative approach combines information from gravitational-wave data, neutrino observations, and AGN optical catalogs to increase the chances of identifying potential sources and studying their properties. We assess the sensitivity of the search using subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, neutrino event candidates from public IceCube Neutrino Observatory data and AGN candidates from the Quaia catalog. A confident detection of such an event would mark a breakthrough in multi-messenger astronomy.

  The AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (STORM 2) campaign targeted Mrk 817 with intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and found its soft X-ray emission to be strongly absorbed. We present results from 157 near-IR spectra with an average cadence of a few days. Whereas the hot dust reverberation signal as tracked by the continuum flux does not have a clear response, we recover a dust reverberation radius of $\sim 90$ light-days from the blackbody dust temperature light-curve. This radius is consistent with previous photometric reverberation mapping results when Mrk 817 was in an unobscured state. The heating/cooling process we observe indicates that the inner limit of the dusty torus is set by a process other than sublimation, rendering it a luminosity-invariant `dusty wall' of a carbonaceous composition. Assuming thermal equilibrium for dust optically thick to the incident radiation, we derive a luminosity of $\sim 6 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the source heating it. This luminosity is similar to that of the obscured spectral energy distribution, assuming a disk with an Eddington accretion rate of $\dot{m} \sim 0.2$. Alternatively, the dust is illuminated by an unobscured lower luminosity disk with $\dot{m} \sim 0.1$, which permits the UV/optical continuum lags in the high-obscuration state to be dominated by diffuse emission from the broad-line region. Finally, we find hot dust extended on scales $&gt; 140-350$ pc, associated with the rotating disk of ionised gas we observe in spatially-resolved [SIII] $\lambda 9531$ images. Its likely origin is in the compact bulge of the barred spiral host galaxy, where it is heated by a nuclear starburst.

  We investigate the relationship among the jet magnetic field, black hole spin, black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and optical variability timescales in jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By fitting a damped random walk (DRW) model to the g-band light curves, we obtain the characteristic variability timescale ($\tau_{\rm DRW}$) for 41 jetted AGNs with precise supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurements. Our main results are as follows: (i) Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the jet magnetic field ($B_{\rm 1pc}$), black hole spin ($j$) and the characteristic variability timescale within our sample. These findings suggest that the optical variability of jetted AGNs is influenced by the jet magnetic field and black hole spin. Furthermore, the characteristic variability timescale aligns with the electron escape timescale, as evidenced by the relationship between the characteristic variability timescale and jet magnetic field ($\tau_{\rm DRW}\propto B_{\rm 1pc}^{0.76\pm0.22}$). (ii) We confirm a significant correlation between the characteristic variability timescale and SMBH mass, expressed as: $\log \rm \tau_{\rm DRW} = 0.52(\pm0.21)\log M _{\rm BH}/M_{\rm \odot}-3.12(\pm1.90)$, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex. The slope of this relationship is consistent with that between the thermal timescale and black hole mass. Our results support the hypothesis that magnetorotational instability (MRI) fluctuations drive the intrinsic variability observed in the light curves emitted by the AGNs accretion disk.

  We present two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical at intermittent structures in plasma turbulence. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. The interaction of DKI and KHI generates qualitatively new structures, marked by a thickened shear layer with very weak electromagnetic field, modulated by KH vortices. Over a range of moderately strong velocity shears explored, the interaction of DKI and KHI results in a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe a new and efficient way of particle acceleration where particles are stochastically accelerated by the motional electric field exterior to the shear layer as they meander in an S-shaped pattern in and out of it. This process takes advantage of the bent geometry of the shear layer caused by the DK-KHI interaction and is responsible for most of the highest-energy particles produced in our simulations. These results further our understanding of dissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures, which are present in plasma turbulence across a wide range of astrophysical contexts such as in AGN jet sheaths, potentially relevant to limb-brightened emission, etc., and highlight the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple interacting instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.

  The Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) carried out a public survey for optical transients between 2007 and 2019, discovering more than 16,000 transient candidates. Here we present the spectra and highlight the results of the spectroscopic follow-up of CRTS extragalactic transients. As expected, we find that the bulk of these transients are normal supernovae. However, as we prioritised transients exhibiting unusual features or environments during our spectroscopic follow-up, we focus on the rarer types of transients. These objects include more than a dozen type-I superluminous supernovae and dozens of type-I and II supernovae that underwent circumstellar medium interactions. We highlight several specific supernovae, including a new analysis of SN 2008iy, a type-IIn which exhibited a bright pre-supernova outburst event similar to SN 2009ip and lasted more than 1800 days; CSS111225:140122+161705, a type-I supernova that showed an extreme 2.5 magnitude rebrightening event more than 200 days after its initial outburst; and SN 2009ny, a type-Ibn supernova that exhibited strong helium emission lines similar to SN 2002ao. We confirm our previous finding that numerous CRTS transients are associated with galaxies of extremely low luminosity. We discuss the difficulty in determining the origin of transients associated with outbursts in active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events, and type-IIn supernovae. As an example, we present CSS150120:110008+385352, a CRTS transient similar to CSS100217:102913+404220 that occurred within a quiescent AGN and peaked at Mv = -23.6.

  The role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in dwarf galaxies remains poorly understood, with conventional wisdom suggesting it primarily suppresses star formation. Using high-resolution MACER3D simulations that directly resolve the Bondi radius, we demonstrate that AGN feedback can significantly enhance rather than suppress star formation in starburst dwarf galaxies. Our simulations reveal that AGN feedback increases global star formation rates by approximately 25% when comparing our models with both AGN and supernova feedback to those with only supernova feedback. This enhancement occurs through AGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling preserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy, creating ideal conditions for star formation. This positive feedback mechanism operates in gas-rich starburst environments with efficient cooling and moderate AGN energy input that compresses gas without expelling it from the galaxy. Critically, it requires both AGN and supernova feedback working in concert: without SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too powerful and expel gas rather than compress it. Our results closely match observations of the starburst dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, where similar shock-compressed regions of enhanced star formation have been observed. These findings challenge conventional understanding of AGN feedback and suggest that AGN may play a previously unrecognized role in accelerating star formation during active phases of dwarf galaxy evolution.
