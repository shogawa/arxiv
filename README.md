  Multiple active galactic nuclei (multi-AGN) are a known result of galaxy mergers. Therefore, they are an important tool for studying the formation and dynamical evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A novel method for the selection of multi-AGN leverages the exquisite positional accuracy of Gaia to detect astrometrically-variable quasars. Previous work has paired this method with radio interferometry on sub-arcsecond scales. In this paper, we present a follow-up study of seven astrometrically-variable quasars from the pilot sample using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We targeted these seven quasars with the VLBA at 2.0-2.4 GHz (S-band) and 8.0-8.4 GHz (X-band), reaching milliarcsecond resolutions, in order to study the radio properties at smaller scales and to constrain the origin of the astrometric variability. The new observations are also used to identify significant radio-optical offsets in all seven objects, suggesting that many astrometrically-variable quasars also exhibit significant radio-optical offsets. We find that four of the seven sources are possible candidate multi-AGN based on their radio properties and radio-optical offsets. Overall, we use this follow-up study to constrain the smaller-scale radio properties of this sample of astrometrically-variable quasars, and continue to explore the use of this method in the field of multi-AGN.

  X-rays provide a robust method in identifying AGN. However, in the high-redshift Universe, their space density is relatively low, and, in combination with the small areas covered by X-ray surveys, the selected AGN are poorly sampled. Deep optical/infrared data are essential for locating counterparts and determining redshifts. In this work, we leverage the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue alongside the extensive optical Dark Energy Survey and the near-infrared VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) to select one of the largest high-z X-ray AGN samples to date. Our analysis focuses on the overlapping area of these surveys, covering about 185 $deg^2$. In addition, we aspire to compare the properties of the X-ray AGN with the optically-selected QSOs. For sources without spectroscopic data (80%), we estimated the photometric redshifts using both SED fitting and machine-learning algorithms. Among the 65,000 X-ray sources in the 4XMM-DES-VHS area, we ended up with 833 z&gt;3.5 AGN (11% having spec-z information) with high reliability and a fraction of outliers {\eta}&lt;10%. The sample completeness is 90%, driven by the depth of DES data. Only 10% of the X-ray selected AGN are also optical QSOs and vice versa. Our findings indicate an observed absorbed fraction ($\log N_H~[cm^{-2}] \geq 23$) of 20-40% for the X-ray AGN, significantly higher than that of optical QSOs. X-ray AGN exhibit fainter observed optical magnitudes and brighter mid-IR magnitudes than optical QSOs. Their median rest-frame SED shapes differ notably with optical QSOs being dominated by AGN emission in the UV-optical wavelengths. While the median SEDs of X-ray AGN suggest extinction in the UV-optical range, individual sources exhibit a wide range of spectral shapes, indicating significant diversity within the population. This analysis supports that X-ray and optically-selected AGN represent distinct and complementary populations.

  Measurements of the number count dipole with large surveys have shown amplitudes in tension with kinematic predictions based on the observed Doppler dipole of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These observations seem to be in direct conflict with a homogeneous and isotropic Universe as asserted by the cosmological principle, demanding further investigation into the origin of the tension. Here, we investigate whether the observed number count dipoles are consistent with being fully kinematic or if there is any residual anisotropy contributing to the total observed dipole. To disentangle these contributions, we aim to leverage the fact that the kinematic matter dipole expected in a given galaxy catalogue scales with observed properties of the sample, and different catalogues used in the literature therefore have different kinematic dipole expectations. We here perform joint dipole fits using the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), and the AGN catalogue derived from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (CatWISE). Assuming a common kinematic and non-kinematic dipole component between all catalogues, we find that a large residual, non-kinematic dipole anisotropy is detected, though a common direction between the two components is disfavoured by model selection. Freeing up both amplitude and direction for this residual dipole while fixing the kinematic dipole to the CMB dipole expectation, we recover a significant residual dipole with $\mathcal{D}_{resid} = (0.81\pm0.14)\times10^{-2}$, that is offset from the CMB dipole direction by $39\pm8$ degrees. While the present work provides a valuable first test of this concept, its scrutinising power is limited by the currently employed catalogues. Larger catalogues, especially in radio, will be needed to further lift the degeneracy between the kinematic and residual dipole components.

  Accretion supermassive black holes in the center of active galaxies usually produce ``jets''-collimated bipolar outflows of relativistic particles. Magnetic fields near the black hole event horizon may play a crucial role in the formation of jets/outflows. Both theory and observation indicate that jets/outflows driven by centrally active supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have a feedback effect on the overall properties of the host galaxies. Therefore, the magnetic field is a key ingredient for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Here we report a clear correlation between the magnetic field of jets and star formation rate (SFR) for a large sample of 96 galaxies hosting supermassive black holes, which suggests that the star formation of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies may be powered by the jets.

  This report presents the findings of a NIAC Phase I feasibility study for the Artemis-enabled Stellar Imager (AeSI), a proposed high-resolution, UV/Optical interferometer designed for deployment on the lunar surface. Its primary science goal is to image the surfaces and interiors of stars with unprecedented detail, revealing new details about their magnetic processes and dynamic evolution and enabling the creation of a truly predictive solar/stellar dynamo model. This capability will transform our understanding of stellar physics and has broad applicability across astrophysics, from resolving the cores of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to studying supernovae, planetary nebulae, and the late stages of stellar evolution. By leveraging the stable vacuum environment of the Moon and the infrastructure being established for the Artemis Program, AeSI presents a compelling case for a lunar-based interferometer. In this study, the AeSI Team, working with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Integrated Design Center (IDC), has firmly established the feasibility of building and operating a reconfigurable, dispersed aperture telescope (i.e., an interferometer) on the lunar surface. The collaboration produced a credible Baseline design featuring 15 primary mirrors arranged in an elliptical array with a 1 km major axis, with the potential to expand to 30 mirrors and larger array sizes through staged deployments. Additionally, this study identified numerous opportunities for optimization and the necessary trade studies to refine the design further. These will be pursued in follow-up investigations, such as a NIAC Phase II study, to advance the concept toward implementation.

  Given recent X-ray observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we consider whether the extreme luminosities of these AGNs are consistent with current semi-analytical models. In particular, we apply extreme-value statistics (EVS) to obtain predictions of extreme X-ray luminosities of AGNs in the redshift range $3\lesssim z\lesssim 6$. We apply this formalism using different X-ray luminosity functions and compare the predicted extreme luminosities to AGNs in the Stripe-82 X-ray catalogue. We find a general consistency between data and the EVS predictions although there is some tension with certain luminosity functions. In addition, the extreme X-ray luminosities are found to be at least an order of magnitude below the Eddington luminosity limit. We discuss possible extensions to this model, including extrapolating our results to even higher redshifts ($z\gtrsim10$) where AGNs have recently been observed.

  Luminous broad H$\alpha$ emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the hallmark of compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly attenuated dusty starbursts and/or obscured active galactic nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs ($z=3.1$ and $z=4.47$) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at $\lambda_\mathrm{rest}=1-4 \ \mu$m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot ($T\gtrsim500$ K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold ($T\lesssim75$ K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [$\mathrm{C}_{II}$] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have $\log(L_\mathrm{IR}/L_\odot) \lesssim 12.2$ at the $3\sigma$ level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.

  Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10.2}M_\odot$) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\sim15\,M_\odot$/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to $&lt;12\,M_\odot$/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\lesssim1$ and $\sim50$ for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernovae feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is unlikely to be the reason behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit $M_\star$, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

  The TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations, produce a diverse population of X-ray cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM) of simulated galaxy clusters. These arise from episodic, high velocity, kinetic energy injections from the central active supermassive black hole (AGN, SMBH). Here, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster with observational data. First, we select a volume-limited sample of 35 real clusters ($z \leq 0.071$, M$_\text{500c}$ = 10$^{14-14.8}$ M$_\odot$) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, identify 3 analogs for each in TNG-Cluster (total of 105) and generate mock Chandra images using same exposure times as their observed counterparts. We identify X-ray cavities and measure their properties in both datasets using identical techniques, ensuring a direct, apples-to-apples comparison. Our analysis reveals that both samples have a similar fraction of X-ray cavities (35-43 per cent). They exhibit comparable sizes and morphologies, although the sizes of simulated X-ray cavities still attached to the SMBH are somewhat larger in TNG-Cluster -- a scarcity at $&lt; 10$ kpc. The area of TNG X-ray cavities increases as they rise in the ICM, consistent with the trend seen in the observational sample. The cavity powers, estimated using observational techniques, show good agreement between the two samples (10$^{42-45}$ erg.s$^{-1}$), suggesting that X-ray cavities in the simulation are an important heating mechanism in cluster cores. Overall, the rather simple AGN feedback model of TNG, with no model choices made to reproduce X-ray morphological features, and without cosmic rays, creates a quantitatively realistic population of X-ray cavities at cluster scales.   

Can primordial black holes explain the overabundance of bright
  super-early galaxies?

  JWST is detecting an excess of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 10$), bright galaxies challenging most theoretical predictions. To address this issue, we investigate the impact of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) on the halo mass function and UV luminosity function (LF) of super-early galaxies. We explore two key effects: (i) the enhancement of massive halos abundance due to the compact nature and spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) the luminosity boost, characterized by the Eddington ratio $\lambda_E$, due to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) powered by matter accretion onto PBHs. We build an effective model, calibrated using data at lower redshifts ($z\approx 4-9$), to derive the evolution of the LF including the additional PBH contribution. Via Bayesian analysis, we find that: (a) Although a small fraction ($\log f_{\rm PBH} \approx -5.42$) of massive ($\log M_{\rm PBH} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \approx 8.37$), non-emitting ($\lambda_E=0$) PBHs can explain the galaxy excess via the halo abundance enhancement, this solution is excluded by CMB $\mu$-distortion constraints on monochromatic PBHs. (b) If PBHs power an AGN emitting at super-Eddington luminosity ($\lambda_E \approx 10$), the observed LF can be reproduced by a PBH population with characteristic mass $\log M_{\rm PBH} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \approx 3.69$ constituting a tiny ($\log f_{\rm PBH} \approx -8.16$) fraction of the cosmic dark matter content. In the AGN scenario, about 75% of the observed galaxies with ${\rm M_{UV}}=-21$ at $z=11$ should host a PBH-powered AGN and typically reside in low mass halos, $M_h = 10^{8-9} {\rm M_{\odot}}$. These predictions can be tested with available and forthcoming JWST spectroscopic data. We note that our analysis considers a lognormal PBH mass function and compares its parameters with monochromatic limits on PBH abundance. Further work is required to relax such limitations.   

What Drives Cluster Cool-Core Transformations? A Population Level

  In this study, we examine the frequency and physical drivers of transformations from cool-core (CC) to non-cool-core (NCC) clusters, and vice versa, in a sample of 352 massive galaxy clusters (M_vir = 10^14-15.3 M_sun) from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation of galaxies. By identifying transformations based on the evolution of central entropy and focusing on z&lt;2.5, we find that clusters frequently undergo such events, depending on their assembly and supermassive black hole histories. On average, clusters experience 2 to 3 transformations. Transformations can occur in both directions and can be temporary, but those to higher entropy cores, i.e. in the direction from CC to NCC states, are the vast majority. CC phases are shorter than NCC phases, and thus overall the TNG-Cluster population forms with low-entropy cores and moves towards NCC states with time. We study the role that mergers play in driving transformations, and find that mergers within ~1Gyr prior to a transformation toward higher (but not lower) entropy cores occur statistically more often than in a random control sample. Most importantly, we find examples of mergers associated with CC disruption regardless of their mass ratio or angular momentum. However, past merger activity is not a good predictor for z=0 CC status, at least based on core entropy, even though clusters undergoing more mergers eventually have the highest core entropy values at z=0. We consider the interplay between AGN feedback and evolving cluster core thermodynamics. We find that core transformations are accompanied by an increase in AGN activity, whereby frequent and repeated (kinetic) energy injections from the central SMBHs can produce a collective, long-term impact on central entropy, ultimately heating cluster cores. Whether such fast-paced periods of AGN activity are triggered by mergers is plausible, but not necessary.

  Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, point-like sources characterized by their red color and broad Balmer lines, which have been debated to be either dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) or dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here we report two LRDs (ID9094 and ID2756) at z$_{\rm spec}$&gt;7, recently discovered in the JWST FRESCO GOODS-North field. Both satisfy the "v-shape" colors and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad H$\beta$ emission lines (full width at half maximum: 2276$\pm$492 km/s for ID9094 and 1069$\pm$239 km/s for ID2756) and narrow [OI] lines ($\sim$ 300-400 km/s). To investigate their nature, we conduct deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the [CII] 158${\rm \mu m}$ emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect [CII] or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. Notably, in the scenario that the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: $&gt;16\sigma$ for [CII] and $&gt;3\sigma$ for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and $&gt;5\sigma$ for [CII] of ID2756. Using the 3$\sigma$ upper limits of [CII] and 1.3 mm, we perform two analyses: (1) UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L$_{[CII]}$-SFR$_{tot}$ empirical relation. Both analyses indicate that LRDs favor the presence of AGN to explain their observed properties. Our results highlight the importance of far-infrared observations for studying LRDs, a regime that remains largely unexplored.

  It has always been believed that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) has an important impact on star formation in massive galaxies. Black hole spin is an important physical parameter of AGN. We use a large sample of massive star-forming galaxies to study the effects of AGN on star formation. Our main results are as follows: (i) There are significant correlations between black hole spin and star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and star formation activity parameter for massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies, respectively. These results indicate that the spin of supermassive black holes regulates the star formation of massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies. (2) The slopes of the relationship between black hole spin and star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and star formation activity parameter for massive star-forming early-type galaxies and late-type galaxies are similar within the error range. These results imply that the mechanism of black hole spin regulating star formation may be similar in massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies.

  Aims. The orientation-based unification scheme of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) asserts that radio galaxies and quasars are essentially the same type of object, but viewed from different angles. To test this unification model, we compared the environments of radio galaxies and quasars, which would reveal similar properties when an accurate model is utilized. Methods. Using the second data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2), we constructed a sample of 26,577 radio galaxies and 2028 quasars at 0.08 &lt; z &lt; 0.4. For radio galaxies with optical spectra, we further classified them as 3631 low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and 1143 high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). We crossmatched these samples with two galaxy cluster catalogs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Results. We find that $17.1 \pm 0.2%$ of the radio galaxies and $4.1 \pm 0.4%$ of the quasars are associated with galaxy clusters. Luminous quasars are very rare in clusters, while $18.7 \pm 0.7%$ LERGs and $15.2 \pm 1.1%$ HERGs reside in clusters. We also note that in radio galaxies, both HERGs and LERGs tend to reside in the centers of clusters, while quasars do not show a strong preference for their positions in clusters. Conclusions. This study shows that local quasars and radio galaxies exist in different environments, challenging the orientation-based unification model. This means that factors other than orientation may play an important role in distinguishing radio galaxies from quasars. The future WEAVE-LOFAR survey will offer high-quality spectroscopic data for a large number of radio sources and allow for a more comprehensive exploration of the environments of radio galaxies and quasars.

  We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.

  We present Surveying the Whirlpool at Arcseconds with NOEMA (SWAN), a high-resolution, high-sensitivity survey to map molecular lines in the 3mm band in M51 (the Whirlpool galaxy). SWAN has obtained the largest high-sensitivity map (5x7 kpc2) of N2H+ emission at cloud-scale resolution (3" ~125 pc) in an external galaxy to date. We describe the observations and data reduction of ~214 hours of interferometric data from NOEMA, ~55 hours of tailored new observations with the IRAM-30m telescope and the combination of NOEMA, new and ~14 hours of archival 30m observations. We detect widespread emission from 9 molecular transition lines. The J=1-0 transitions of CO isotopologues 13CO and C18O are detected at high significance across the full observed field-of-view (FoV). HCN, HNC, HCO+, and N2H+(1-0) are detected in the center, molecular ring and spiral arms of the galaxy, while the shock tracer HNCO(4-3), (5-4) and PDR tracer C2H(1-0) are detected in the central ~1 kpc and molecular ring only. For most of the lines that we detect, average line ratios with respect to CO are increased by up to a factor of ~3 in the central 1 kpc, where an AGN and its low-inclination outflow are present, compared to the disk. Across the full SWAN FoV, 13CO, C18O, HCN, HNC, HCO+ and N2H+ are 8\pm2, 29\pm6, 17\pm3,37\pm5, 26\pm5 and 63\pm38 times fainter than 12CO, respectively, in pixels where each line is significantly detected. Although we observe variations in line ratios between larger-scale environments like the center and disk of M51, the scatter within each environment also indicates the influence of smaller-scale processes. The ability to measure these effects is only possible thanks to the high resolution and high sensitivity of the SWAN dataset across multiple environments. This provides the sharpest view of these molecular transitions over the largest physical area ever captured in an external galaxy.

  The physical origins of the diverse emission-line asymmetries observed in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) remain incompletely understood. Monitoring the temporal variations of line profiles offers a promising approach to investigating the underlying physics. In this study, we present an analysis of the broad H$\beta$ emission line profiles of eight AGNs observed from the end of 2016 to May 2023 as part of the reverberation mapping campaign titled "Monitoring AGNs with H$\beta$ Asymmetry" (MAHA), utilizing data obtained from the Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO) 2.3-meter telescope. We measure the temporal variations of line asymmetry, width, and central velocity shift for the eight objects. Our findings reveal that the variation in asymmetry is positively correlated with H$\beta$ flux in five of the eight objects, while the remaining objects exhibit negative or complex correlations. Furthermore, we observe anti-correlations between line width and H$\beta$ flux for most objects, indicating the presence of the "breathing" phenomenon in their H$\beta$ emission lines. In contrast, two objects demonstrate an "anti-breathing" phenomenon or complex behavior. We discuss the physical origins of the temporal variations in line profiles and propose the possibility of decomposing the variations in H$\beta$ asymmetry and width into components: one that corresponds to short-term variations in H$\beta$ flux and another that reflects long-term variations in continuum light curves, perhaps driven by radiation pressure.
