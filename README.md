  3C 403 is a well known FRII radio galaxy, whose jets extend up to the kpc scale. In this letter, we present its identification as the second most significant source among the more than 150 inspected using the 15-year neutrino dataset of the ANTARES Collaboration, possibly making it the first radio galaxy with neutrino emission. Following the previous association of blazars with netrinos events, we aimed at studying the jet properties and its possible role in neutrino production. We collected multi-scale radio observations to assess the properties of the jet from the kpc to pc scale. Moreover, the high-energy properties of its AGN were inspected. Through the analysis of the jet orientation on the different scales, we verified that neither the inner nor the extended jet seems to have a viewing angle close to the line of sight. Instead, the jet seems to lie on the plane of the sky. In addition, we tested the recently proposed scaling relation between neutrino and hard X-rays fluxes, identified for blazars and Seyfert galaxies, against the measured fluxes for 3C 304. We found that the source lies in the region between blazars and Seyferts, altough the current upper limit on neutrino flux does not allow us to be conclusive on the correlation. In these regards, 3C 403 is an intermediate case between the previous cases of neutrino associations, providing a useful test case for future models.

  We present a detailed analysis of J154506, a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) behind the Lupus-I molecular cloud, and characterization of its physical properties. Using a combination of archival and new data (including sub-arcsecond resolution ($\sim0.75$) ALMA observations, VLT/MUSE and FORS2 optical data, as well as spectral scans from the ACA and the LMT) we identify two high-significance (SNR&gt;5) emission lines at 97.0 and 145.5 GHz, corresponding to CO(4-3) and CO(6-5), respectively. These detections yield a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm{spec}}=3.7515\pm 0.0005$. We also report the detection of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m fine-structure line at 400 GHz using the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), further confirming the redshift and providing insights into J154506's physical properties. By modeling ALMA Band 6 and 7 continuum data in the uv-plane, we derive an average magnification factor of $6.0 \pm 0.4$ and our analysis reveals a relatively cold dust ($\sim$37 K) in a starburst galaxy with a high intrinsic dust mass ($\sim2.5\times10^{9}~\rm{M}_{\odot}$) and infrared (IR) luminosity ($\sim6\times10^{12}~\rm{L}_{\odot}$). The dust SED is best reproduced by a model dominated by moderately dense molecular gas ($10^2-10^4\rm{cm}^{-3}$), indicating that the far-infrared emission arises primarily from diffuse regions rather than compact, high-pressure environments typical of extreme starbursts or AGN. This is supported by the close-to-unity ratio between the dust and kinetic temperatures, which argues against highly energetic heating mechanisms. The CO excitation ladder peaks close to CO(5-4) and is dominated by slightly denser molecular gas. Our results underscore the unique power of far-IR and submillimeter observations to both uncover and characterize scarce, strongly lensed, high-redshift galaxies, even when obscured by foreground molecular clouds.

  We use JWST/NIRSpec observations of the radio galaxy 3C 293 to map the emission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well as stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by ~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the H$_2$2.12$\mu$m emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64$\mu$m and Pa$\alpha$. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk seen as a narrow component ($\sigma$ ~ 100 kms$^{-1}$); a blueshifted broad outflow ($\sigma$ ~ 250 kms$^{-1}$); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad component ($\sigma$ ~ 640 kms$^{-1}$). Extinction maps reveal high A$_V$ values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust lanes are detected in H$_2$ gas, with a mass inflow rate of $\dot{M}_{in}$ ~ 8 x 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the AGN accretion rate. For the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.14 $\pm$ 0.04 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (molecular) and 5.5 $\pm$ 1.44 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 4.5% of the jet power - enough to suppress star formation. Our results highlight 3C 293's turbulent post-merger history and JWST's unique capability to probe dust-obscured AGN.

  We investigate the orbital decay of a massive BH embedded in a dark matter halo and a stellar bulge, using both analytical and numerical simulations with the aim of developing and validating a reliable dynamical friction (DF) correction across simulation resolutions. We develop a Python-based library to solve the equations of motion of the BH and provide an analytical framework for the numerical results. Then, we carry out simulations at different resolutions and for different softening choices using the Tree-PM code OpenGADGET3, where we implement an improved DF correction based on a kernel-weighted local density estimation. Our results demonstrate that the DF correction significantly accelerates BH sinking and ensures convergence with increasing resolution, closely matching analytical predictions. We find that in low-resolution regimes - particularly when the BH mass is smaller than that of the background particles - our DF model still effectively controls BH dynamics. Contrary to expectations, the inclusion of a stellar bulge can delay sinking due to numerical heating, an effect partially mitigated by the DF correction. We conclude that our refined DF implementation provides a robust framework for modeling BH dynamics both in controlled simulation setups of galaxies and in large-scale cosmological simulations. This will be crucial for future simulation campaigns, to enable more accurate predictions of AGN accretion and feedback, and to estimate gravitational-wave event rates.
