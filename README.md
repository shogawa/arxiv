  The assembly and co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their host galaxy stellar population is a key open questions in galaxy evolution. Stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), are inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED). For galaxies triggering SMBH activity, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contaminates the light at all wavelengths, hampering the inference of galaxy parameters. Incomplete AGN templates can lead to systematic overestimates of the stellar mass, biasing our understanding of AGN-galaxy co-evolution. This challenge has gained further impetus with the advent of sensitive wide-area surveys with millions of luminous AGN, including by eROSITA, Euclid and LSST. We aim to estimate the accuracy and bias of AGN host galaxy parameters and improve upon existing techniques. This work makes two contributions: 1) a new SED fitting code, GRAHSP, with a flexible, empirically motivated AGN model including a power law continuum emission lines, a FeII forest and a flexible infrared torus. We verify that our model reproduces published X-ray to infrared SEDs of AGN to better than 20\% accuracy. A fully Bayesian fit with nested sampling includes uncertainties in the model and the data, making the inference highly robust. 2) we created a benchmark photometric dataset where pure quasars are merged with non-AGN pure galaxies into a hybrid (Chimera) object but with known galaxy and AGN properties. Comparing the true and retrieved $M_\star$, SFR and AGN luminosities shows that previous codes systematically over-estimate $M_\star$ and SFR by 0.5 dex with a wide scatter of 0.7 dex, at AGN luminosities above 10^44 erg/s. In contrast, GRAHSP shows no bias on $M_\star$ and SFR. GRAHSP also estimates more realistic uncertainties. GRAHSP enables characterization of the environmental conditions conducive to black hole growth. (abridged)

  The existence of high-$z$ over-massive supermassive black holes represents a major conundrum in our understanding of black hole evolution. In this paper, we probe from the observational point of view how early Universe environmental conditions could have acted as an evolutionary mechanism for the accelerated growth of the first black holes. Under the assumption that the early Universe is dominated by dwarf galaxies, we investigate the hypothesis that dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions trigger black hole accretion. We present the discovery of 82 dwarf-dwarf galaxy pairs and 11 dwarf galaxy groups using the Hubble Space Telescope, doubling existing samples. The dwarf systems span a redshift range of 0.13$&lt;$z$&lt;$1.5, and a stellar mass range of 7.24$&lt;$log(M$_*$/\(M_\odot\))$&lt;$9.73. We performed an X-ray study of a subset of these dwarf systems with Chandra and detected six new AGN, increasing the number of known dwarf-dwarf-merger-related AGN from one to seven. We then compared the frequency of these AGN in grouped/paired dwarfs to that of isolated dwarfs and found a statistically significant enhancement (4$\sigma$-6$\sigma$) in the interacting sample. This study, the first of its kind at the lowest mass scales, implies that the presence of a nearby dwarf neighbor is efficient in triggering black hole accretion. These results open new avenues for indirect studies of the emergence of the first supermassive black holes.

  Advances in time domain astronomy have produced a growing population of flares from galactic nuclei, including both tidal disruption events (TDEs) and flares in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Because TDEs are uncommon and AGN variability is abundant, large-amplitude AGN flares are usually not categorized as TDEs. While TDEs are normally channelled by the collisional process of two-body scatterings over relaxation timescale, the quadrupole moment of a gas disk alters the stellar orbits, allowing them to collisionlessly approach the central massive black hole (MBH). This leads to an effectively enlarged loss cone, the \emph{loss wedge}. Earlier studies found a moderate enhancement, up to a factor $\sim 2-3$, of TDE rates $\dot{N}_{\rm 2b} $ for a static axisymmetric perturbation. Here we study the loss wedge problem for an evolving AGN disk, which can capture large number of stars into the growing loss wedge over much shorter times. The rates $\dot{N}_{\rm cl}$ of collisionless TDEs produced by these time-evolving disks are much higher than the collisional rates $\dot{N}_{\rm 2b}$ in a static loss wedge. We calculate the response of a stellar population to the axisymmetric potential of an adiabatically growing AGN disk and find that the highest rates of collisionless TDEs are achieved for the largest (i) MBH masses $M_{\bullet}$ and (ii) disk masses $M_{\rm d}$. For $M_{\bullet}\sim 10^7 M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm d} \sim 0.1 M_{\bullet}$, the rate enhancement can be up to a factor $\dot{N}_{\rm cl}/\dot{N}_{\rm 2b} \sim 10$. The orbits of collisionless TDEs sometimes have a preferred orientation in apses, carrying implications for observational signatures of resulting flares.

  The presence of kiloparsec-sized bubble structures in both sides of the Galactic plan suggests active phases of Sgr A$^\star$, the central supermassive black hole of the Milky-Way in the last 1-6 Myr. The contribution of such event on the cosmic-ray flux measured in the solar neighborhood is investigated with numerical simulations. We evaluate whether the population of high-energy charged particles emitted by the Galactic Center could be sufficient to significantly impact the CR flux measured in the solar neighborhood. We present a set of 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations, following the anisotropic propagation of CR in a Milky - Way like Galaxy. Independent populations of cosmic-ray are followed through time, originating from two different sources types, namely Supernovae and the Galactic Center. To assess the evolution of the CR flux spectrum properties, we split these populations into two independent energy groups of 100 GeV and 10 TeV. We find that the anisotropic nature of cosmic-ray diffusion dramatically affects the amount of cosmic-ray energy received in the solar neighborhood. Typical timescale to observe measurable changes in the CR spectrum slope is of the order 10 Myr, largely surpassing estimated ages of the Fermi bubbles in the AGN jet-driven scenario. We conclude that a cosmic-ray outburst from the Galactic center in the last few Myr is unlikely to produce any observable feature in the local CR spectrum in the TeV regime within times consistent with current estimates of the Fermi bubbles ages.
