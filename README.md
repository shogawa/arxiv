  We analyze the validity of optical diagnostic diagrams relying on emission-lines ratios and in the context of classifying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) according to the cosmic metallicity evolution in the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 11.2. In this regard, we fit the results of chemical evolution models (CEMs) to the radial gradients of the N/O abundances ratio derived through direct estimates of electron temperatures (Te-method) in a sample of four local spiral galaxies. This approach allows us to select representative CEMs and extrapolate the radial gradients to the nuclear regions of the galaxies in our sample, inferring in this way the central N/O and O/H abundances. The nuclear abundance predictions for theoretical galaxies from the selected CEMs, at distinct evolutionary stages, are used as input parameters in AGN photoionization models built with the Cloudy code. We found that standard BPT diagnostic diagrams are able to classify AGNs with oxygen abundances 12+logO/H &gt; 8.0 [(Z/Zsolar) &gt; 0.2) preferably found at redshift z &gt; 4. On the other hand, the HeII4685/Hbeta versus [N II]6584/Halpha diagram produces a reliable AGN classification independent of the evolutionary stage of these objects.

  Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are known to be bright $\gamma$-ray sources, frequently exhibiting active (flaring) periods. The blazar PKS~2155-304 is a high synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object located at redshift $z=0.116$. On 2006 July 28, an extremely remarkable outburst of VHE $\gamma$-ray emission from this blazar was reported by the H.E.S.S. experiment, with an average flux more than 10 times the low-state level. The variability timescale of this extraordinary flare was as short as approximately 200~s. In order to guarantee the transparency of the emission region for TeV photons, the fast variability demands an extremely high Doppler factor $\delta_{\rm D}&gt;50$ of the jet within the classical one-zone model, leading to the so-called ``Doppler factor crisis''. Here we demonstrate that the stochastic dissipation model, which is a multi-blob scenario for blazars, can self-consistently explain the giant TeV flares of PKS~2155-304 and the low-state emission before and after the flares, in terms of both multi-wavelength spectral and variability characteristics. The required Doppler factor in this model can be as low as 20, which is a reasonable and typical value for blazar jets. The obtained model parameters may shed some light on the physical properties of the relativistic jet.

  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies are an enigmatic class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that exhibit peculiar multiwavelength properties across the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, these sources have allowed us to explore the innermost regions of the central engine of AGN using X-ray observations and have also provided clues about the origin of relativistic jets considering radio and gamma-ray bands. Keeping in mind the ongoing and upcoming wide-field, multi-frequency sky surveys, we present a new catalogue of NLSy1 galaxies. This was done by carrying out a detailed decomposition of &gt;2 million optical spectra of quasars and galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 (SDSS-DR17) using the publicly available software "Bayesian AGN Decomposition Analysis for SDSS Spectra". The catalogue contains 22656 NLSy1 galaxies which is more than twice the size of the previously identified NLSy1s based on SDSS-DR12. As a corollary, we also release a new catalogue of 52273 broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies. The estimated optical spectral parameters and derived quantities confirm the previously known finding of NLSy1 galaxies being AGN powered by highly accreting, low-mass black holes. We conclude that this enlarged sample of NLSy1 and BLSy1 galaxies will enable us to explore the low-luminosity end of the AGN population by effectively utilizing the sensitive, high-quality observations delivered by ongoing/upcoming wide-field sky surveys. The catalogue has been made public at https://www.ucm.es/blazars/seyfert

  Binary black holes embedded within the accretion disks that fuel active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising progenitors for the source of gravitational wave events detected by LIGO/VIRGO. Several recent studies have shown that when these binaries form they should be highly eccentric and retrograde. However, many uncertainties remain concerning the orbital evolution of these binaries as they either inspiral towards merger or disassociate. Previous hydrodynamical simulations exploring their orbital evolution have been predominantly two-dimensional, or have been restricted to binaries on nearly circular orbits. We present the first high-resolution, three-dimensional local shearing-box simulations of both prograde and retrograde eccentric binary black holes embedded in AGN disks. We find that retrograde binaries shrink several times faster than their prograde counterparts and exhibit significant orbital eccentricity growth, the rate of which monotonically increases with binary eccentricity. Our results suggest that retrograde binaries may experience runaway orbital eccentricity growth, which may bring them close enough together at pericenter for gravitational wave emission to drive them to coalescence. Although their eccentricity is damped, prograde binaries shrink much faster than their orbital eccentricity decays, suggesting they should remain modestly eccentric as they contract towards merger. Finally, binary precession driven by the AGN disk may dominate over precession induced by the supermassive black hole depending on the binary accretion rate and its location in the AGN disk, which can subdue the evection resonance and von Ziepel-Lidov-Kozai cycles.
