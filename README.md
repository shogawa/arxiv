  Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the heart of virtually every massive galaxy, it remains debated whether dwarf galaxies also commonly host SMBHs. Because low-mass galaxies may retain a memory of the assembly history of their black holes, probing the black hole occupation fraction of local dwarf galaxies might offer insights into the growth and seeding mechanisms of the first black holes. In this work, we exploit the Western half of the eROSITA all-sky survey (covering $20,000~\rm{deg^2}$) and compile a catalog of accreting SMBHs in local ($D&lt;200$~Mpc) dwarf galaxies. After cleaning our sample from cosmic X-ray background sources, X-ray binaries, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, we identify 74 AGN-dwarf galaxy pairs. Using this large and uniform sample, we derive a luminosity function of dwarf galaxy AGN, fitting it with a power law function and obtaining ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}L_{\rm X} = (15.9\pm2.2)\times L_{\rm X}^{-1.63\pm0.05}$. Measuring the offset between the centroid of dwarf galaxies and the X-ray sources, we find that about $50\%$ of the AGN are likely off-nuclear, in agreement with theoretical predictions. We also compare the black hole-to-stellar mass relation of the AGN in our sample with the local and high-redshift relations, finding that our sources better adhere to the former. This suggests that local AGN across different mass scales underwent a similar growth history. Finally, we compare our sources with semi-analytical models: while our sample is too shallow to distinguish between different seeding models, it favors a growth mechanism linked to the star-formation rate of the host galaxy.

  Baryonification algorithms model the impact of galaxy formation and feedback on the matter field in gravity-only simulations by adopting physically motivated parametric prescriptions. In this paper, we extend these models to describe gas temperature and pressure, allowing for a self-consistent modelling of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, weak gravitational lensing, and their cross-correlation, down to small scales. We validate our approach by showing that it can simultaneously reproduce the electron pressure, gas, stellar, and dark matter power spectra as measured in all BAHAMAS hydrodynamical simulations. Specifically, with only two additional free parameters, we can fit the electron pressure auto- and cross-power spectra at 10% while reproducing the suppression in the matter power spectrum induced by baryons at the per cent level, for different AGN feedback strengths in BAHAMAS. Furthermore, we reproduce BAHAMAS convergence and thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich angular power spectra within 1% and 10% accuracy, respectively, down to l = 5000. When used jointly with cosmological rescaling algorithms, the baryonification presented here will allow a fast and accurate exploration of cosmological and astrophysical scenarios. Therefore, it can be employed to create mock catalogues, lightcones, and large training sets for emulators aimed at interpreting forthcoming multi-wavelength observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe.

  We present a study of the radio variability of bright, $S_{1.4}\geq100$ mJy, high-redshift quasars at $z\geq3$ on timescales up to 30-40 years. The study involved simultaneous RATAN-600 measurements at frequencies of 2.3, 4.7, 8.2, 11.2, and 22.3 GHz in 2017-2020. In addition, data from the literature were used. We have found that the variability index, $V_S$, which quantifies the normalized difference between the maximum and minimum flux density while accounting for measurement uncertainties, ranges from 0.02 to 0.96 for the quasars. Approximately half of the objects in the sample exhibit a variability index within the range of 0.25 to 0.50, comparable to that observed in blazars at lower redshifts. The distribution of $V_S$ at 22.3 GHz is significantly different from that at 2.3-11.2 GHz, which may be attributed to the fact that a compact AGN core dominates at the source's rest frame frequencies greater than 45 GHz, leading to higher variability indices obtained at 22.3 GHz (the $V_S$ distribution peaks around 0.4) compared to the lower frequencies (the $V_S$ distribution at 2.3 and 4.7 GHz peaks around 0.1-0.2). Several source groups with distinctive variability characteristics were found using cluster analysis of quasars. We propose 7 new candidates for gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) sources and 5 new megahertz peaked-spectrum (MPS) sources based on their spectrum shape and variability features. Only 6 out of 23 sources previously reported as GPS demonstrate a low variability level typical of classical GPS sources ($V_{S} &lt; 0.25$) at 4.7-22.3 GHz. When excluding the highly variable peaked-spectrum blazars, we expect no more than 20% of the sources in the sample to be GPS candidates and no more than 10% to be MPS candidates.

  The evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is closely connected to their host galaxies and surroundings. Via feedback processes, AGN can counteract the cooling of the intracluster medium (ICM) and suppress star formation in their host galaxies. Radio observations at low frequencies provide a glimpse into the history of AGN activity. The Virgo cluster is a substantial reservoir of nearby galaxies and provides an ideal laboratory for the study of AGN as well as their feedback mechanisms. The aim of our work is to characterise the AGN population within the Virgo cluster down to low radio luminosities, constrain the AGN duty cycle and investigate environmental feedback in cluster member galaxies. We analyse 144 MHz and 1.3 GHz radio observations of early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS) taken with LOFAR and MeerKAT. We detect 12 of these galaxies at 144 MHz, 5 of which show clearly extended radio emission. The radio luminosity shows a strong dependence on the stellar mass of the host galaxy, in agreement with previous results. As a notable outlier, the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 4365 ($M_* = 2.2 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$) is not detected as a compact source in the LOFAR observations. Instead, it is surrounded by diffuse, low-surface brightness emission, which hints towards a past phase of stronger nuclear activity. Furthermore, we find a cavity in NGC 4472 (= M 49) inflated by the wide-angle tail only visible in the LOFAR data, which implies that the cavity was created by a past outburst. The corresponding cavity power is of the same order of magnitude as the jet power in the present duty cycle of the AGN.
