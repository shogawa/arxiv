Extracting polarimetric information from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data is demanding but vital for understanding the synchrotron radiation process and the magnetic fields of celestial objects, such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, conventional CLEAN-based calibration and imaging methods provide suboptimal resolution without uncertainty estimation of calibration solutions, while requiring manual steering from an experienced user. We present a Bayesian polarization calibration and imaging method using Bayesian imaging software resolve for VLBI data sets, that explores the posterior distribution of antenna-based gains, polarization leakages, and polarimetric images jointly from pre-calibrated data. We demonstrate our calibration and imaging method with observations of the quasar 3C273 with the VLBA at 15 GHz and the blazar OJ287 with the GMVA+ALMA at 86 GHz. Compared to the CLEAN method, our approach provides physically realistic images that satisfy positivity of flux and polarization constraints and can reconstruct complex source structures composed of various spatial scales. Our method systematically accounts for calibration uncertainties in the final images and provides uncertainties of Stokes images and calibration solutions. The automated Bayesian approach for calibration and imaging will be able to obtain high-fidelity polarimetric images using high-quality data from next-generation radio arrays. The pipeline developed for this work is publicly available.

Our previous work identified a class of SDSS quasars exhibiting multiple Gaia detections, classifying them as candidates for various astrophysical systems such as quasar-star pairs, dual quasars, and gravitationally lensed quasars. In this paper, we present a pilot VLBI study targeting a radio-bright subsample and report the first high-resolution imaging results. By leveraging the milliarcsecond-scale resolution of VLBI and its precise astrometric coordination incorporating with Gaia, we aim to refine the classification of these multiple matched sources, search for potential dual AGNs, and assess the efficacy of the combined Gaia-VLBI approach in resolving ambiguous quasar systems. We cross-matched the SQUAB quasar sample with the FIRST and NVSS catalogs, identifying 18 radio-emitting sources. The three brightest were selected for dual-frequency (1.6 and 4.9 GHz) VLBA observations. We performed VLBI imaging at both Gaia positions, constructed spectral index maps, and estimated brightness temperatures to characterize the radio morphology and physical properties. For the three target sources, our VLBI observations reveal compact radio structures consistent with single AGN at the primary Gaia positions. No significant emission is detected at the secondary Gaia locations. These results support the interpretation of the sources as quasar$-$star pairs, in line with earlier studies. This pilot study demonstrates the value of radio-VLBI high-resolution follow-ups on Gaia-selected quasar systems with multiple counterparts, showing how they can unambiguously reveal the true nature of these systems and help remove contaminants from dual AGN candidate samples.

We present here the results from a second epoch of phase-referenced VLBA observations of 8 Seyfert and LINER galaxies from the KISSR sample. These sources were chosen based on the presence of double peaks or asymmetries in their emission lines as observed in SDSS spectra. Parsec-scale radio emission is detected in 7 of the 8 sources in the second epoch. Jet-like features appear to persist over a $\sim4-9$ year timeline in these `radio-quiet' AGN. A few sources like KISSR1494, however, show significantly different structures after a 9 year interval. KISSR102, which was previously suggested to be a binary black hole candidate based on the presence of two compact cores, shows the tentative signatures of superluminal jet motion ($1.05\pm0.45$c). Tentative superluminal motion in a jet knot has been reported in another source, KISSR872 ($1.65\pm0.57$c). We present 1.5 GHz images from the VLA A-array of 4 sources. These images reveal core-lobe or core-halo structures. The alignment of the VLBI jet direction with the kpc-scale spectral index gradient, as well as the mismatch between the star formation rate derived from the radio and H$α$ line emission, support the suggestion that the kpc-scale emission is AGN-jet-related. The jets in KISSR sources appear to lose collimation over spatial scales between 200 parsec and 1 kpc. Overall, the characteristics of the KISSR jets are reminiscent of similar properties observed in VLBI monitoring studies of `radio-loud' AGN jets even as subtle differences related to the compactness and brightness of jet features remain.

JWST/NIRCam observations reveal dense stellar cores in high-redshift galactic bulges, indicative of sustained star formation and potential stellar accretion. We introduce accretion-modified star (AMS) as a new component in the chemical evolution of high-redshift bulges hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The gas-phase chemical evolution of bulge environments containing AMS is modeled within 1 Gyr by combining population evolution and galactic chemical evolution formalisms, and observational signatures are tracked via photoionization modeling on Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. Sustained high accretion onto AMSs leads to rapid gas-phase metal enrichment of the bulge, producing abundance peaks up to five times solar metallicity within 0.1 Gyr and significantly modifying elemental ratios in the gas phase. Atypical gas-phase abundance patterns during early, high-accretion phases and gradually diminish as the accretion rate declines. In BPT diagrams, high-AMS-accretion scenarios shift the modeled emission-line sequence toward the local AGN branch and extend into the high-metallicity regime. Super-solar narrow-line regions observed in AGNs at z&gt;15 may reflect such AMS-driven gas-phase enrichment of host bulge under extreme gas densities. While direct detection of AMSs within AGN bulges remains challenging, the model provides testable predictions for future spectroscopic surveys and motivates further exploration of non-canonical stellar populations in AGN host bulges.  

Too Quiet for Comfort: Local Little Red Dots Lack Variability over Decades

Several local ($z\lesssim 0.2$) metal-poor dwarf AGNs have remarkably similar properties to those of high-redshift Little Red Dots (LRDs), and are recently proposed to be local analogs of LRDs. We use long-term photometric and spectroscopic observations of three local LRDs spanning $\sim 20$ years to measure variability in their rest-frame optical continuum and broad H$α$ emission lines. Using ZTF light curves over a rest-frame $\sim 5$ yr baseline, the $r$-band intrinsic rms variability is $(9\times 10^{-5})_{\rm -9E-5}^{+0.014}$ mag (J1022), $0.025\pm0.004$ mag (J1025) and $0.020\pm0.005$ mag (J1047), indicating low intrinsic variability ($&lt;3-4\%$ at 3$σ$). These rms variability amplitudes are much lower than those for dwarf AGNs and more massive quasars. There is little structure in the optical variability structure functions for the three local LRDs, in contrast to normal AGN variability. Using available multi-epoch spectra, we constrain the broad H$α$ line flux variability to be less than a few percent, without significant profile changes, over a rest-frame baseline of $\sim 15$ yrs in J1025 and J1047, respectively. The three LRDs stand out in the Balmer line properties compared with normal broad-line AGNs, with exceptionally large H$α$ equivalent widths and H$α$/H$β$ ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. In the context of recent theoretical models of LRDs as dense gas-enshrouded massive black holes with super-Eddington accretion, our results suggest that the photosphere emission is long-term stable and the broad Balmer lines are primarily collisonally excited. This scenario is consistent with the lack of variability, large H$α$/H$β$ ratios and little dust extinction, as well as the expected high gas density. Virial black hole mass estimates using broad H$α$ assuming photoionization are therefore highly questionable for LRDs.

We report the results of the optical follow-up of a sample of $γ$-ray-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN). New high-quality optical spectra were obtained using Gran Telescopio Canarias with Optical System for Imaging and low- Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy and the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope Unit Telescope 1 with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph 2. From the analysis of these spectra, we confirmed the previous classification as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) for four objects and discovered two new NLS1s, bringing the total number of optically confirmed $γ$-NLS1s to 26. We also identified two ambiguous cases between NLS1 and intermediate Seyfert (IS), three IS, one broad-line Seyfert 1, one Seyfert 2. Based on the new spectra, we calculated black hole masses ranging from $10^{6.25}$ to $10^{9.32}$ $M_\odot$, and Eddington ratios spanning 0.05 to 2.07. This reclassification reinforces the scenario in which AGN with relatively small black hole masses are capable of launching powerful relativistic jets, contributing to our broader understanding of $γ$-ray-emitting AGN.  

Electron densities from [S II] lines significantly overestimate the impact of ionised AGN outflows

To explain the properties of the local galaxy population, theoretical models require active galactic nuclei (AGN) to inject energy into host galaxies, thereby expelling outflows of gas that would otherwise form stars. Observational tests of this scenario rely on determining outflow masses, which requires measuring the electron density ($n_e$) of ionised gas. However, recent studies have argued that the most commonly used diagnostic may underestimate electron densities (and hence overestimate outflow masses) by several orders of magnitude, casting doubt as to whether ionised AGN-driven outflows can provide the impact needed to reconcile observations with theory. Here, we investigate this by applying two different electron-density diagnostics to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy of the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample of 48 nearby type-2 quasars. Accounting for uncertainties, we find that outflow masses implied by the transauroral-line electron-density diagnostic are significantly lower than those produced by the commonly-used `strong-line' [S II](6717/6731) method, indicating a different origin of these emission lines and suggesting that these doubts are justified. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to modify the [S II](6717/6731) electron-density diagnostic for our sample by applying a correction of $\mathrm{log}_{10}(n_{e\mathrm{,\, outflow}}\mathrm{ [cm}^{-3}\mathrm{]}) = \mathrm{log}_{10}(n_{e\mathrm{,[S\,II]}}\mathrm{ [cm}^{-3}\mathrm{]}) + 0.75(\pm0.07)$ to account for this, which results in values that are statistically consistent with those produced using the transauroral-line method. The techniques that we present here will be crucial for outflow studies in the upcoming era of large spectroscopic surveys, which will also be able to verify our results and broaden this method to larger samples of AGN of different types.
