  Reverberation mapping (RM) has long been a powerful tool for measuring the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but the precision of these mass measurements depends on the so-called virial factors. It has been demonstrated that the virial factors exhibit significant diversity, spanning approximately 1-2 orders of magnitude across different AGNs. However, the underlying physical drivers for the diversity have not yet been finalized. Here, adopting the SMBH mass -- spheroid luminosity relations of inactive galaxies with different bulge classifications, we calibrate the virial factors corresponding to the AGNs with pseudobulges (PB) and classical bulges (or elliptical hosts, CB) using the latest nearby RM sample. We investigate the correlations between virial factors and the AGN spectral properties, and find that for both PB and CB samples, the FWHM-based virial factors exhibit significant anti-correlations with the emission-line widths and profiles, while the $\sigma_{\rm line}$-based virial factors only show moderate anti-correlations with line widths for PB. We attribute these correlations mainly to the inclination angle or opening angle of the broad-line regions. Moreover, we establish new relations to give more precise virial factors and, in combination with the latest iron-corrected radius-luminosity relation, develop tentatively new single-epoch estimators of SMBH masses, which enable more accurate measurements of SMBH masses in large AGN samples.

  The gas-phase metallicity distribution within galaxies records critical information about galactic evolution. In this work we investigate how active galactic nuclei (AGN) influence this distribution by measuring the two-point correlation functions of gas-phase metallicity in 95 non-AGN and 37 AGN-host galaxies from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field spectroscopy Area integral field spectrographic survey. We measure metallicity using a novel Bayesian method that properly includes both stellar and AGN contributions to emission line fluxes and allows us to measure metallicities in both AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies in a single, consistent framework. We find that the two-point correlation functions of both AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies are well-fit by a simple injection-diffusion model, and that the correlation lengths $l_\mathrm{corr}$ we derive for the non-AGN galaxies are reasonably consistent with those obtained in earlier work. The AGN-host galaxies generally have smaller $l_\mathrm{corr}$ than non-AGN galaxies at fixed stellar mass, but similar $l_\mathrm{corr}$ at fixed star formation rate (SFR), suggesting that the primary effect of hosting an AGN in this sample is a reduction in SFR at fixed stellar mass, and that this in turn suppresses the correlation length. Our findings further indicate that, while both SFR and stellar mass are positively correlated with metallicity correlation length $l_\mathrm{corr}$, the former is more fundamental, implying that fluctuations in the metallicity distribution within galaxies are driven more by short-term responses to physical processes such as star formation that can change much faster than a Hubble time.

  The origin of diffuse high-energy neutrinos from TeV to PeV energies detected by IceCube Observatory remains a mystery. In our previous work, we have shown that hadronuclear (p-p) interactions in AGN jets could be important and generate detectable very-high-energy emissions. Here, we further explore these interactions in the AGN jets based on their luminosity function. The diffuse neutrino flux and corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux have been calculated and compared with observational data. In our modeling, two beaming patterns are considered separately. To make sure that the corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux does not overshoot the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background, we find that if the neutrino production region in jet is opaque to $\gamma$ rays, p-p interactions in AGN jets with a small viewing angle (the blazar case) are able to interpret the PeV neutrino background. Similarly, AGN jets with a large viewing angle (the radio galaxy case) may interpret the TeV neutrino background. While, if the neutrino production region is transparent to $\gamma$ rays, only blazars have the potential to interpret the DNB around PeV band. Some caveats are also discussed.

  We present spatially resolved VLT/SINFONI spectroscopy with adaptive optics of type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the SINFONI Survey for Unveiling the Physics and Effect of Radiative feedback (SUPER), which targeted X-ray bright ($L_{2-10 keV}\gtrsim10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) AGN at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$). Our analysis of the rest-frame optical spectra unveils ionised outflows in all seven examined targets, as traced via [OIII]$\lambda$5007 line emission, moving at $v\gtrsim600$ km s$^{-1}$. In six objects these outflows are clearly spatially resolved and extend on 2-4 kpc scales, whereas marginally resolved in the remaining one. Interestingly, these SUPER type-2 AGN are all heavily obscured sources ($N_{H}\gtrsim10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) and host faster ionised outflows than their type-1 counterparts within the same range of bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol} \sim 10^{44.8-46.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$). SUPER has hence provided observational evidence that the type-1/type-2 dichotomy at $z\sim2$ might not be driven simply by projection effects, but might reflect two distinct obscuring life stages of active galaxies, as predicted by evolutionary models. Within this picture, SUPER type-2 AGN might be undergoing the 'blow-out' phase, where the large amount of obscuring material efficiently accelerates large-scale outflows via radiation pressure on dust, eventually unveiling the central active nucleus and signal the start of the bright, unobscured type-1 AGN phase. Moreover, the overall population of ionised outflows detected in SUPER has velocities comparable with the escape speed of their dark matter halos, and in general high enough to reach 30-50 kpc distances from the centre. These outflows are hence likely to sweep away the gas (at least) out of the baryonic disk and/or to heat the host gas reservoir, thus reducing and possibly quenching star formation.

  We present the first detailed radio study of the galaxy cluster XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at $z$ = 1.46 using MeerKAT $L$-band (1.3 GHz) observations. We combine our radio observation with archival optical and infrared data to investigate the star formation and AGN population within $R_{200}$ ($R = $ 0.8 Mpc) of the cluster centre. Using three selection criteria; the radio luminosity, the far-infrared radio ratio ($q_{\rm{IR}}$) and the mid-infrared colour, we distinguish galaxies with radio emission predominantly powered by star formation from that powered by AGNs. We selected 24 cluster members within $R_{\rm{200}}$ in the MeerKAT image based on either their photometric or spectroscopic redshift. We classified 12/24 ($50\%$) as galaxies whose radio emission is dominated by star-formation activity, 6/24 ($25\%$) as intermediate star-forming galaxies and 6/24 ($25\%$) as AGN-dominated galaxies. Using the radio continuum luminosities of the star-forming cluster galaxies, we estimated an integrated star formation rate (SFR) value of 1700 $\pm$ 330 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ within $R_{200}$. We derived a mass-normalized integrated SFR value of $(570 \pm 110) \times 10^{-14}$ yr$^{-1}$. This supports previous observational and theoretical studies that indicated a rapid increase in star formation activity within the core of high-redshift clusters. We also show that the high AGN fraction within the cluster core is consistent with previous cluster observations at $z &gt;$ 1.5.   

The Host Galaxy Fluxes of Active Galaxy Nuclei Are Generally
  Overestimated by the Flux Variation Gradient Method

  In terms of the variable nature of normal active galaxy nuclei (AGN) and luminous quasars, a so-called flux variation gradient (FVG) method has been widely utilized to estimate the underlying non-variable host galaxy fluxes. The FVG method assumes an invariable AGN color, but this assumption has been questioned by the intrinsic color variation of quasars and local Seyfert galaxies. Here, using an up-to-date thermal fluctuation model to simulate multi-wavelength AGN variability, we theoretically demonstrate that the FVG method generally overestimates the host galaxy flux; that is, it is more significant for brighter AGN/quasars. Furthermore, we observationally confirm that the FVG method indeed overestimates the host galaxy flux by comparing it to that estimated through other independent methods. We thus caution that applying the FVG method should be performed carefully in the era of time-domain astronomy.
