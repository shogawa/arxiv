  Metallicity ($Z$) estimates based on ultraviolet (UV) emission lines from the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been found to differ from those derived from optical lines. However, the origin of this discrepancy ($ZR$) remains poorly understood. To investigate the source of $ZR$, we compiled from the literature the fluxes of narrow near-UV ($1000 &lt; \lambda(\angstrom) &lt; 2000)$ and optical ($3000 &lt; \lambda(\angstrom) &lt; 7000)$ emission line measurements for a sample of 11 AGNs (9 at $z&lt;0.4$ and 2 at $z\sim2.4$). Metallicity values for our sample were derived using a semi-empirical calibration based on the $C43$=log[(\ion{C{iv}$\lambda$1549+\ion{C{iii}]$\lambda$1909)/\ion{He}{ii}$\lambda$1640] emission-line ratio and compared with those obtained via direct measurement of the electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$-method) and via calibrations based on optical emission-lines. The source of the discrepancy was investigated in terms of the ionization parameter ($U$), electron density ($N_{\rm e}$), and carbon abundance (C/H). We found a weak correlation between $ZR$, $U$ and $N_{\rm e}$. However, a moderate correlation was observed between $ZR$ and direct estimates of C/H, suggesting that the previously assumed (C/O)-$Z$ relations in photoionization models used to derive UV carbon-line calibrations may not be valid for AGNs. By combining a large set of abundance estimates for local star-forming regions with those of our AGN sample, we derived a new (C/O)-$Z$ relation. Comparisons between the results of photoionization models that assume this new abundance relation and the UV observational data of our sample produce $Z$ values derived from the $C43$ index that are consistent with those obtained using the $T_{\rm e}$-method.

  AT 2019aalc is a peculiar sequence of highly variable emission events observed towards the nucleus of the broad-line AGN SDSS J152416.66+045119.0. The system exhibited two distinct UV/optical flares (the first detected in 2019, the second one in 2023). Spectra obtained following the detection of the second flare revealed prominent Bowen fluorescence and high-ionization coronal emission lines, which were much weaker, if at all detectable, in a spectrum taken following the first flare. We present and analyze a large set of multi-wavelength, multi-epoch data for this source, with particular emphasis on optical spectroscopic monitoring conducted with the Las Cumbres Observatory network. During the relatively slow dimming that followed the second optical flare, the UV/optical light-curve shows a sequence of minor rebrightening events, while the Bowen fluorescence and the coronal lines vary (roughly) in tandem with these "bumps" in the broad-band light-curve. Most of the observed behavior of AT 2019aalc links it to the growing class of Bowen fluorescence flares (BFFs) while setting it apart from canonical tidal disruption events. However, AT 2019aalc has some outstanding peculiarities, including two short flares seen in its soft X-ray light-curve during the dimming phase of the second optical flare, and which do not seem to be linked to the emission line variations. We discuss the optical and X-ray properties of the source and possible scenarios of the origin of the flare, in particular radiation pressure instabilities in the (pre-existing) AGN accretion disk.
