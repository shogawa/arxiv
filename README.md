Intrinsic alignments of galaxies are potentially a major contaminant of cosmological analyses of weak gravitational lensing. We construct a semi-analytic model of galaxy ellipticities and alignments in the \Euclid Flagship simulation to predict this contamination in Euclid's weak lensing observations. Galaxy shapes and orientations are determined by the corresponding properties of the host haloes in the underlying $N$-body simulation, as well as the relative positions of galaxies within their halo. Alignment strengths are moderated via stochastic misalignments, separately for central and satellite galaxies and conditional on the galaxy's redshift, luminosity, and rest-frame colour. The resulting model is calibrated against galaxy ellipticity statistics from the COSMOS Survey, selected alignment measurements based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey samples, and galaxy orientations extracted from the Horizon-AGN hydrodynamic simulation at redshift $z=1$. The best-fit model has a total of 12 alignment parameters and generally reproduces the calibration data sets well within the $1σ$ statistical uncertainties of the observations and the \flagship simulation, with notable exceptions for the most luminous sub-samples on small physical scales. The statistical power of the calibration data and the volume of the single \flagship realisation are still too small to provide informative prior ranges for intrinsic alignment amplitudes in relevant galaxy samples. As a first application, we predict that \Euclid end-of-mission tomographic weak gravitational lensing two-point statistics are modified by up to order $10\,\%$ due to intrinsic alignments.

In this paper we perform a multi-messenger investigation of the efficiency of stellar scattering in tightening supermassive black hole binaries by jointly comparing models to the observed galaxy stellar core population and to results of nanohertz gravitational wave observations. Our model uses merger trees from the IllustrisTNG cosmological suite of simulations to predict stellar mass deficits in core galaxies. We take into account dynamical friction, stellar scattering, and gravitational wave emission and compare to the observed relation between core mass deficit and galaxy stellar mass. We find that to match observations, binary hardening in the stellar scattering regime must be about 1.6 times faster than N-body experiments suggest. Most importantly we find that, even assuming a full loss-cone, hardening by stellar scattering alone is insufficient to explain the low frequency turnover seen in the gravitational wave background. This strongly suggests that gas-dynamics play an important role in hardening and provides a reason to be optimistic about electromagnetically visible binary AGN.

Galaxy mergers are critical events that influence galaxy evolution by driving processes such as enhanced star formation, quenching, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. However, constraining the timescales over which these processes occur in the post-merger phase has remained a significant challenge. This study extends the MUlti-Model Merger Identifier (\textsc{Mummi}) framework to predict post-merger timescales ($T_{PM}$) for galaxies, leveraging machine learning models trained on realism-enhanced mock observations derived from the IllustrisTNG simulations. By classifying post-merger galaxies into four temporal bins spanning 0 to 1.76 Gyr after coalescence, \textsc{Mummi} achieves time classification accuracies exceeding 70 per cent. We apply this framework to the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), yielding a catalog of 8,716 post-merger galaxies with $T_{PM}$ predictions and stellar masses $\log(M_*/M_\odot) \geq 10$ at redshifts 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.3. These results provide a robust methodology to connect galaxy interaction timescales with physical processes, enabling detailed studies of galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime.

The formation of structure in the Universe at large scales is dominated by gravity, with baryonic physics becoming significant at $\sim{\rm Mpc}$ scales. To capture the impact of baryonic physics, cosmological simulations must model gas dynamics and a host of relevant astrophysical processes. A recent extension of the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) couples its gravity solver with a modern smoothed particle hydrodynamics method. This extension incorporates sub-resolution models for chemical enrichment, black hole and star formation, AGN kinetic and thermal feedback, supernova-driven feedback, galactic winds, and metal-line cooling. We present an inference framework based on high-fidelity emulators to aid in model calibration against observational targets, e.g., the galaxy stellar mass function, radial gas density profiles, and the cluster gas fraction. The emulators are trained on simulation suites comprising 64 boxes with side-length $128\,h^{-1}$Mpc and 16 boxes with side-length $256\,h^{-1}$Mpc with $2\times 512^3$ and $2\times 1024^3$ particles, respectively. Our analysis reveals two distinct AGN kinetic feedback modes -- a low-feedback mode yielding strong agreement with the observed radial gas density profiles of massive X-ray clusters, and a high-feedback mode providing a better fit to cluster gas fraction data, but systematically underestimating gas densities in inner regions.

We search for galaxy-scale (Dysonian) waste heat in the mid-infrared using WISE. Starting from the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), we cross-match to CatWISE2020 and AllWISE, apply standard MIR AGN/starburst vetoes (Stern, Assef R90, Jarrett), and treat W1 and W2 as stellar baselines and W3 and W4 as constraining bands. For each galaxy and for blackbody waste heat temperatures T=150-600 K, we convert W3/W4 photometry into conservative 3-sigma per-galaxy upper limits on the bolometric waste heat luminosity using the WISE bandpass (RSR) color correction. The resulting distributions have median caps of ~(5-9) x 10^8 L_sun across T=150-600 K. Aggregated at the population level, the one-sided 95% upper bound on the fraction of nearby galaxies that could host waste heat above a given threshold monotonically decreases with threshold and asymptotes to ~1/6500 at high thresholds (set by the sample size). Sensitivity transitions from W4 at T &lt;= 200K to W3 at T &gt;= 300K. Interpreted with the AGENT formalism, a fiducial Milky Way like stellar luminosity L_=3 x 10^10 L_sun implies typical per galaxy caps of alpha = L_wh/L_ &lt;= 1.7-2.9% over T=150-600 K (e.g., alpha &lt;= 1.8% at T=300 K). At T ~= 300K, no more than f_95 ~= 1.61 x 10^-4 (~= 0.0161%) of nearby galaxies can host KIII-scale systems reprocessing &gt;= 21% of a Milky Way-like stellar luminosity into ~ 300K waste heat.

The broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is an essential component, yet its small size keeps its origin, structure, and kinematics uncertain. Infrared interferometry with VLTI/GRAVITY is now resolving BLR-scale emission, with data for NGC 3783 consistent with a rotating, geometrically thick configuration. However, the processes shaping the spectra remain poorly constrained, and the cloud models are tuned phenomenologically rather than derived from first-principles predictions. We address this by coupling three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of gas around a supermassive black hole with radiative-transfer calculations using Cloudy, comparing the results to the SINFONI Br$γ$ profile of NGC 3783. We find that Br$γ$ arises from ionized gas in the surface of the rotating thin disk, with electron temperatures of approximately $T_e \approx 10^4$ K and number densities of $n_e \approx 10^8-10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the intrinsic line profile produced by the RHD kinematics is narrower than observed and displays substructure. An approximate treatment of the electron scattering suggests that scattering in surrounding diffuse ionized gas significantly broadens and smooths the intrinsic Br$γ$ profile, making it consistent with the observed profile. This scattering medium has an electron temperature of $10^4 - 10^5$ K, and a number density of $n \lesssim 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Although a best-fit viewing angle of $\approx 15$ deg is suggested, the scattered line is notably less sensitive to inclination than the intrinsic line. The observed BLR profiles may be understood as the intrinsic emission viewed through an electron-scattering haze, such that some spectral detail is plausibly redistributed rather than seen directly.  

Ruling Out Compact Jets as the Dominant Source of Radio Emission in Radio-quiet, High Eddington-ratio Active Galactic Nuclei

The origin of core radio emission in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is still actively debated. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations often predict the launching of moderately large-scale jets from super-Eddington accretion flows, but this prediction seems at odds with observations indicating most high/super-Eddington AGNs appear radio quiet. Here, we use the ratio of radio to X-ray luminosities as a multiwavelength diagnostic to probe the origin of radio emission in a sample of 69 radio-quiet, high/super-Eddington AGNs with black-hole masses $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5}-10^{9}~M_\odot$. With this wide dynamic range in $M_{\rm BH}$, we adapt existing formalisms for how jetted radio emission and accretion-powered X-ray emission scale with black hole mass into the super-Eddington regime. We find that the radio/X-ray luminosity ratios observed across this $M_{\rm BH}$ range are inconsistent with a jet-dominated model for radio emission. We discuss how our results may instead be consistent with a corona-dominated radio emission origin with a contribution from outflows at higher accretion rates.

We analyzed the 25 richest galaxy groups in COSMOS-Web at z = 0.18-3.65, identified via the AMICO algorithm. These groups contain 20-30 galaxies with high (&gt;75%) membership probability. Our study reveals both passive-density and active-density relations: late-type galaxies (LTGs) prefer higher central overdensities than early-type galaxies (ETGs) across all groups, and many massive LTGs exhibit colors typical of quiescent galaxies. We identify red sequences (RS) in 5 groups, prominently established at z &lt; 1, with early emergence in the RS locus up to z ~ 2.2.   This suggests group environments represent a transitional phase where star formation quenching precedes morphological transformation, contrasting with the classical morphology-density relation in rich clusters. In the central regions (~33 arcsec / 100 kpc from centers), we identified 86 galaxies: 23 (~27%) ETGs and 63 (~73%) LTGs. High-mass galaxies (M_star &gt; 10^10.5 M_sun) undergo rapid quenching over ~1 Gyr, becoming predominantly spheroidal ETGs. This indicates morphological transformation accelerates in massive systems during peak cosmic star formation. Intermediate-mass galaxies (10^9 &lt; M_star/M_sun &lt; 10^10.5) show mild quenching, while low-mass galaxies (M_star &lt; 10^9 M_sun) remain largely star-forming; here, environmental processes suppress star formation without destroying disks, suggesting group quenching operates on longer timescales than mass quenching. Overall, mass-dependent quenching dominates the high-mass end, while environment shapes lower-mass systems. The HLAGN fraction for both groups and field increases with redshift, peaking at z ~ 2, with groups consistently showing higher fractions. We suggest AGN feedback partially drives rapid quenching in high-mass galaxies, while mergers may trigger AGN activity.

Internal feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in galaxy evolution, but external environmental effects can also strongly influence galaxies. We investigate the impact of environment on galaxy evolution, and its dependence on baryonic physics implementation, using Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) spanning a wide range of stellar and AGN feedback implementations in the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, and Swift-EAGLE galaxy formation models. We show that satellite galaxies are significantly affected by the environment in all simulation models, with their gas fraction and star formation rate (SFR) suppressed in overdense regions compared to similar mass satellites in underdense environments at $z=0$. Central galaxies are less sensitive to environment but tend to show lower gas fraction and SFR in overdense regions at low stellar mass, transitioning to higher gas fraction and SFR for massive galaxies in higher-density environments. Halo baryon fraction ($f_{\rm B}$) and circumgalactic medium mass fraction ($f_{\rm CGM}$) at $z=0$ show clear environmental effects. In SIMBA, low-mass haloes in overdense regions have systematically lower $f_{\rm B}$ and $f_{\rm CGM}$ at fixed halo mass, while Swift-EAGLE haloes in overdense regions have systematically higher $f_{\rm B}$ and $f_{\rm CGM}$ across the full halo mass range, and IllustrisTNG and ASTRID show opposite trends at the low and high mass ends. Environmental effects can flip at higher redshift, with SFR and $f_{\rm B}$ increasing with local density in low-mass haloes before quenching at an increasing overdensity threshold. Our results demonstrate that the impact of environment on galaxy evolution depends significantly on galaxy formation model, and higher-density environments can either suppress or enhance star formation depending on galaxy mass and cosmic epoch.

Baryonic processes such as radiative cooling and feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) directly redistribute baryons in the Universe but also indirectly redistribute dark matter due to changes in the gravitational potential. In this work, we investigate this "back-reaction" of baryons on dark matter using thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, including parameter variations in the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, and Swift-EAGLE galaxy formation models. Matching haloes to corresponding N-body (dark matter-only) simulations, we find that virial masses decrease owing to the ejection of baryons by feedback. Relative to N-body simulations, halo profiles show an increased dark matter density in the center (due to radiative cooling) and a decrease in density farther out (due to feedback), with both effects being strongest in SIMBA (&gt; 450% increase at r &lt; 0.01 Rvir). The clustering of dark matter strongly responds to changes in baryonic physics, with dark matter power spectra in some simulations from each model showing as much as 20% suppression or increase in power at k ~ 10 h/Mpc relative to N-body simulations. We find that the dark matter back-reaction depends intrinsically on cosmology (Omega_m and sigma_8) at fixed baryonic physics, and varies strongly with the details of the feedback implementation. These results emphasize the need for marginalizing over uncertainties in baryonic physics to extract cosmological information from weak lensing surveys as well as their potential to constrain feedback models in galaxy evolution.  

GA-NIFS: high prevalence of dusty and metal-enriched outflows in massive and luminous star-forming galaxies at $z\sim3-9$

We present a search for and characterization of ionized outflows in 15 star-forming systems at $z\sim3-9$ with no evidence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU as part of the GA-NIFS program. The targets often show satellites and complex substructure, from which we isolate 40 galaxies/regions. The sample probes the high-mass end of the galaxy population, with most sources having log$_{10}$~(M$_\star$/M$_\odot$)=$9.5-11$, extending previous studies on high-z star formation driven outflows that mainly focused on lower-mass galaxies. Using the [OIII]5007 and H$α$ emission lines, we identify broad kinematic components consistent with galactic outflows in 14 galaxies/regions. We find that the outflowing gas is more dust attenuated (by $A_{\rm V}$$\sim0.59$ mag on average) and metal-enriched (0.13 dex) than the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxies, but its velocities are insufficient to escape the galaxies and reach the circumgalactic medium, suggesting that outflows mainly redistribute dust and metals around their hosts. The outflows identified in this study display velocity dispersions within $σ_{\rm out}=130-340$~km~s$^{-1}$ and outflow velocities $v_{\rm out}=170-600$~km~s$^{-1}$, and, when combined with less luminous and less massive star-forming galaxies from previous works, reveal a statistically significant correlation between $v_{\rm out}$ and star formation rate (SFR). The typically low mass-loading factors ($η=\dot{M}_{\rm out}/SFR$$\leq1$, in 9 out of 14 the outflows) indicate that these outflows do not strongly suppress star formation. Overall, our results suggest that ejective feedback via ionized outflows is inefficient in massive, luminous star-forming galaxies within the first 2 Gyr of the Universe.
