  Context. According to the hierarchical structure formation model, brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) evolve into the most luminous and massive galaxies in the Universe through multiple merger events. The peculiar radio source 4C 35.06 is located at the core of the galaxy cluster Abell 407, overlapping with a compact group of nine galaxies. Low-frequency radio observations have revealed a helical, steep-spectrum, kiloparsec-scale jet structure and inner lobes with less steep spectra, compatible with a recurring active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity scenario. However, the host galaxy of the AGN responsible for the detected radio emission remained unclear.   Aims. We aim to identify the host of 4C 35.06 by studying the object at high angular resolution and thereby confirm the recurrent AGN activity scenario.   Methods. To reveal the host of the radio source, we carried out very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with the European VLBI Network of the nine galaxies in the group at 1.7 and 4.9 GHz.   Results. We detected compact radio emission from an AGN located between the two inner lobes at both observing frequencies. In addition, we detected another galaxy at 1.7 GHz, whose position appears more consistent with the principal jet axis and is located closer to the low-frequency radio peak of 4C 35.06. The presence of another radio-loud AGN in the nonet sheds new light on the BCG formation and provides an alternative scenario in which not just one but two AGNs are responsible for the complex large-scale radio structure

  Identifying methods to discover dual AGN has proven to be challenging. Several indirect tracers have been explored in the literature, including X/S-shaped radio morphologies and double-peaked (DP) emission lines in the optical spectra. However, the detection rates of confirmed dual AGN candidates from the individual methods remain extremely small. We search for binary black holes in a sample of six sources that exhibit both X-shaped radio morphology and DP emission lines using the VLBA. Three out of the six sources show dual VLBA compact components, making them strong candidates for binary black hole sources. In addition, we present deep uGMRT images revealing the exquisite details of the X-shaped wings in three sources. We present a detailed precession modeling analysis of these sources. The BH separations estimated from the simplistic geodetic precession model are incompatible with those estimated from emission line offsets and the VLBA separations. However, precession induced by a noncoplanar secondary black hole is a feasible mechanism for explaining the observed X-shaped radio morphologies and the black hole separations estimated from other methods. The black hole separations estimated from the double-peaked emission lines agree well with the VLBA compact component separations. Future multi-frequency VLBA observations will be critical in ruling out or confirming the binary black hole scenario in the three galaxies with dual component detections.

  The study of the physics of accretion discs developed around the supermassive black hole (BH) candidates are essential theoretical tools to test their nature. Here, we study the accretion flow and associated emission using generalised $\alpha$-discs on to horizonless dark compact objects, in order to compare with the traditional BH scenario. The BH alternative here proposed consists in a dense and highly degenerate core made of fermionic dark matter (DM) which is surrounded by a more diluted DM halo. Such a dense core -- diluted halo DM configuration is a solution of the Einstein equations of General Relativity (GR) in spherical symmetry, which naturally arises once the quantum nature of the DM fermions is dully accounted for. The methodology followed in this work consist in first generalising the theory of $\alpha$-discs to work in the presence of regular and horizonless compact objects, and second, to apply it to the case of core-halo DM profiles typical of active-like galaxies. The fact that the compactness of the dense and transparent DM core scales with the particle mass, allows for the following key findings of this work: (i) it always exist a given core compacity -- i.e., corresponding particle mass -- which produces a luminosity spectrum which is basically indistinguishable from that of a Schwarzschild BH of the same mass as the DM core; (ii) the disc can enter deep inside the non-rotating DM core, allowing for accretion powered efficiencies as high as $28\%$, thus comparable to that of a highly rotating Kerr BH. These results, together with the existence of a critical DM core mass of collapse into a supermassive BH, open new avenues of research for two seemingly unrelated topics such as AGN phenomenology and dark matter physics.
