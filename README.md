Post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, having recently experienced a starburst followed by rapid quenching, are excellent laboratories to probe physical mechanisms that drive starbursts and shutting down of star formation. Integral-field spectroscopy reveals the galaxies' spatially-resolved properties, where observed directional patterns can be linked to the galaxies' past evolution. We measure the resolved star-formation histories (SFHs), stellar metallicity evolution and dust properties of three local PSBs from the MaNGA survey, down to $0.5$" resolution ($\sim0.3\,$kpc) using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Local parameters were constrained simultaneously with parameters describing spatial trends. We found that all three galaxies first experienced an outer, weaker and slower quenching starburst, followed by a central, stronger and faster quenching starburst that peaked $\sim 1\,$Gyr after the first. The central starbursts induced a significantly stronger rise in stellar metallicity compared to the outer starbursts. These results are consistent with the effects of a recent gas-rich (wet) merger, where the first pericentre passage triggered starbursts in the outer regions, while the later coalescence triggers a stronger centralised starburst. We find non-axisymmetric features in the maps of burst mass fraction and dust attenuation in all galaxies, which could be caused by tidal effects during the recent merger. Comparisons with literature binary merger simulations suggests that the galaxies' rapid quenching was driven by gas consumption and the stabilisation against gas gravitational collapse by a growing spheroid, while AGN feedback was not necessarily a primary cause.

Modern time-domain surveys produce alert streams at a scale that makes exhaustive manual inspection infeasible, requiring automated methods to identify unusual transients for follow-up. In this work, we present an unsupervised anomaly detection pipeline applied to the ZTF alert stream using the Lasair broker. We define normal objects as SN Ia, SN II, and SN Ib/c. Anomalous objects include (i) more exotic transients (AGN, TDEs, SLSNe, CVs, and nuclear transients) and (ii) supernova-labeled objects, either spectroscopically or by Lasair, with anomalous properties, such as incorrect or absent host associations, or non-supernova-like light curves. Our pipeline consists of three independently trained simple autoencoders operating on distinct alert stream data products: object features, triplet image cutouts, and light curves. Each model is trained on predominantly normal transients, and performance is assessed using the recall of exotic objects and the purity of all anomalous objects across both a spectroscopically classified held-out test set and the live alert stream. In the test set, performance is evaluated at a fixed rank corresponding to the top ten scoring candidates, while in the alert stream it is evaluated using an anomaly threshold defined from test set behavior. Across both settings, the algorithms consistently recover exotic transients and anomalous supernovae among their top-ranked candidates. Over 25 days of live alert stream application, we identify 87 unusual supernova candidates for follow-up. The overlap between anomalies flagged by different autoencoders in the test set is non-existent, and in the alert stream is small, with maximum overlap between any two algorithms being 11 objects. The framework is data-efficient, requiring only a few thousand training examples, making it well suited for early and ongoing application to the Rubin Observatory alert stream.

We present an analysis of medium/high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra for 11 LRDs at $z \sim 4$. By decomposing the broad and narrow components of the Balmer emission lines, we investigate the connection between line emission and UV/optical continua for the LRD population. We find that the broad H$α$ luminosity strongly correlates with the optical continuum (but not with the UV), indicating a common AGN origin for both. In contrast, the [O III] line strength is correlated with the UV continuum rather than the optical. Using the width and luminosity of the broad H$α$ line, we estimate central black hole masses of $10^6-10^8 M_{\odot}$ accreting at high Eddington ratios, consistent with an early ($λ_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.6$), rapid-growth phase of AGN evolution. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate in the framework of slim-disk models, we infer growth timescales of $\sim 10^5-10^7\rm yr$, and suggest LRDs may evolve into narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Upper limits from our spectra indicate that LRDs exhibit intrinsically weak optical Fe II emission compared to typical AGN. To simultaneously account for the inferred broad-line region size and observed luminosity, we propose a "Clumpy Envelope" model in which the optical emission arises from an extended, clumpy gas with a characteristic radius of tens of light-days. The diversity in observed optical continuum shapes can be explained by radial temperature gradients and self-absorption effects within this structure. Our results demonstrate the power of JWST high-resolution spectroscopy in probing the central engines and physical nature of the LRD population.

Context. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare transients that provide important insights into the physics of galactic nuclei. A recently identified feature in their optical light curves is the presence of early bump-like structures (precursors) that appear before the onset of the main flare or during its rise. Aims. We aim to build and study the first sample of precursor TDEs in order to improve our understanding of these features, which could be key to revealing the origin of the optical emission in TDEs. Methods. We compiled all known precursor TDEs from the literature, searched for additional candidates, and analyzed them as a sample. Results. We find that precursor TDEs predominantly fall within the repeating TDE, fast TDE, and TDE in active galactic nucleus (AGN) subclasses. We reveal a positive correlation between the occurrence time of the precursors relative to the main peak and the central black hole mass. Conclusions. We suggest that the precursors appear due to interactions between the incoming stellar debris and the disk or leftover material from an earlier disruption (repeating and fast TDEs) or a stable pre-existing disk (TDEs in AGNs). Precursors are therefore potentially key signatures of repeating partial TDEs in previously quiescent galaxies.

We present a panchromatic optical-mm characterization of GNz7q, a recently identified X-ray weak, rapidly growing red quasar embedded within a dusty starburst galaxy at $z=7.1899$, using the full suite of JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, and archival NOEMA observations. Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM $=2221\pm20$kms$^{-1}$), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($λ_{\rm Edd}=2.7\pm0.4$) with a mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot})=7.55\pm0.34$, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators. After subtracting the point source, we robustly detect stellar emission from the host galaxy across multiple NIRCam and MIRI filters. Out joint morphological-spectral analysis yields a stellar mass of $\log (M_*/M_\odot)=10.5\pm0.4$ and an intense star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=330\pm97\,M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$, confirming the host as a massive, dusty starburst galaxy. We find that GNz7q lies on the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation ($M_{\rm BH}/M_*\simeq 0.001$) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)\approx 9$ and $M_*\approx 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim 6$, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe.
