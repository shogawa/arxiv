  The Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei (UMAGN) is a comprehensive theoretical framework aimed at elucidating the diverse observations of AGN, encompassing quasars and Seyfert galaxies. The Model attributes the observed variations to different orientations of a surrounding matter disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH), with the primary factor influencing observational diversity being the alignment of the AGN with the observer's line of sight. We present a comprehensive overview of the observational evidence, empirical and theoretical research, tracing key milestones that led to a unified perspective. We encapsulate the scientific journey culminating in the proposal of the UMAGN, including insights into the accretion disk, torus, and relativistic jet, and emphasize the properties of objects within UMAGN. Additionally, we underscore recent progress in multimessenger research involving electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves, astroparticles, and neutrinos, notably through collaborations such as the Event Horizon Telescope, LIGO/Virgo, IceCube, Pierre Auger, and KM3Net. We argue that these advancements present opportunities to enhance and refine UMAGN, contributing to a deeper understanding of AGNs and their implications for the formation and evolution of galaxies. The convergence of observational and theoretical research, coupled with emerging multimessenger techniques, paves the way for further strides in comprehending these enigmatic cosmic phenomena.

  We present the results of a comparison between different methods to estimate the power of relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We selected a sample of 32 objects (21 flat-spectrum radio quasars, 7 BL Lacertae Objects, 2 misaligned AGN, and 2 changing-look AGN) from the Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 43 GHz of the Boston University blazar program. We then calculated the total, radiative, and kinetic jet power from both radio and high-energy gamma-ray observations, and compare the values. We found an excellent agreement between the radiative power calculated by using the Blandford and K\"onigl model with 37 or 43 GHz data, and the values derived from the high-energy $\gamma-$ray luminosity. The agreement is still acceptable if 15 GHz data are used, although with a larger dispersion, but it improves if we use a constant fraction of the $\gamma-$ray luminosity. We found a good agreement also for the kinetic power calculated with Blandford and K\"onigl model with 15 GHz data, and the value from the extended radio emission. We also propose some easy-to-use equations to estimate the jet power.

  The co-evolution between supermassive black holes and their environment is most directly traced by the hot atmospheres of dark matter halos. Cooling of the hot atmosphere supplies the central regions with fresh gas, igniting active galactic nuclei (AGN) with long duty cycles. Outflows from the central engine tightly couple with the surrounding gaseous medium and provide the dominant heating source preventing runaway cooling. Every major modern hydrodynamical simulation suite now includes a prescription for AGN feedback to reproduce realistic populations of galaxies. However, the mechanisms governing the feeding/feedback cycle between the central black holes and their surrounding galaxies and halos are still poorly understood. Galaxy groups are uniquely suited to constrain the mechanisms governing the cooling-heating balance, as the energy supplied by the central AGN can exceed the gravitational binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we provide a brief overview of our knowledge of the impact of AGN on the hot atmospheres of galaxy groups, with a specific focus on the thermodynamic profiles of groups. We then present our on-going efforts to improve on the implementation of AGN feedback in galaxy evolution models by providing precise benchmarks on the properties of galaxy groups. We introduce the \XMM~ Group AGN Project (X-GAP), a large program on \XMM~ targeting a sample of 49 galaxy groups out to $R_{500c}$.

  The presence of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) on scales of a few tens of kpc can be used to study merger-induced accretion on supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and offer insights about SMBH mergers, using dual AGNs as merger precursors. In this study, we use the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to investigate the properties and evolution of dual AGNs. We first analyze the properties of AGNs ($L_{bol} &gt; 10^{43} \rm erg/s$) and their neighboring SMBHs (any SMBHs closer than 30 pkpc to an AGN) at $z \leq 2$. This is our underlying population. Subsequently, we applied the luminosity threshold of $L_{bol} &gt; 10^{43} erg/s$ to the neighboring SMBHs thereby identifying dual and multiple AGNs in our simulation. We examined the properties and statistics of dual AGNs in comparison to single AGNs. Our findings indicate an increase in the number of both single and dual AGNs from lower to higher redshifts. All dual AGNs in our sample resulted from major mergers. Compared with the single AGN population, duals are characterized by a lower black hole to halo mass ratio. We found that the properties of dual AGN host halos, including halo mass, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas mass, are generally consistent with those of single AGN halos, albeit tending towards the higher end of their respective property ranges. Our analysis uncovered a diverse array of evolutionary patterns among dual AGNs, including rapidly evolving systems, slower ones, and instances where SMBH mergers are ineffective.

  Disentangling the radio flux contribution from star formation (SF) and active-galactic-nuclei (AGN) activity is a long-standing problem in extragalactic astronomy, since at frequencies of $\lesssim$ 10 GHz, both processes emit synchrotron radiation. We present in this work the general objectives of the PARADIGM Project, a multi-instrument concept to explore star-formation and mass assembly of galaxies. We introduce two novel general approaches for a detailed multiscale study of the radio emission in local U/LIRGs. In this work, we use archival interferometric data from the Very Large Array (VLA) centred at ~ 6 GHz (C band) and present new observations from the e-Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) for UGC5101, VV705, VV250 and UGC8696. Using our image decomposition methods, we robustly disentangle the radio emission into distinct components by combining information from the two interferometric arrays. We use e-MERLIN as a probe of the core-compact radio emission (AGN or starburst) at ~ 20 pc scales, and as a probe of nuclear diffuse emission, at scales ~ 100 - 200 pc. With VLA, we characterise the source morphology and the flux density on scales from 200 pc up to and above 1 kpc. As a result, we find deconvolved and convolved sizes for nuclear regions from ~ 10 pc to ~ 200 pc. At larger scales, we find sizes of 1.5 - 2 kpc for diffuse structures (with effective sizes of ~ 300 - 400 pc). We demonstrate that the radio emission from nuclear extended structures (~ 100 pc) can dominate over core-compact components, providing a significant fraction of the total multiscale SF output. We establish a multiscale radio tracer for star formation by combining information from different instruments. Consequently, this work sets a starting point to potentially correct for overestimations of AGN fractions and underestimates of SF activity.

  How galaxies regulate nuclear growth through gas accretion by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is one of the most fundamental questions in galaxy evolution. One potential way to regulate nuclear growth is through a galactic wind that removes gas from the nucleus. It is unclear whether galactic winds are powered by jets, mechanical winds, radiation, or via magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes. Compact obscured nuclei (CONs) represent a significant phase of galactic nuclear growth. These galaxies hide growing SMBHs or unusual starbursts in their very opaque, extremely compact (r $&lt;$ 100 pc) centres. They are found in approximately 30 % of the luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG and ULIRG) population. Here, we present high-resolution ALMA observations ($\sim$30 mas, $\sim$5 pc) of ground-state and vibrationally excited HCN towards ESO 320-G030 (IRAS 11506-3851). ESO 320-G030 is an isolated luminous infrared galaxy known to host a compact obscured nucleus and a kiloparsec-scale molecular wind. Our analysis of these high-resolution observations excludes the possibility of a starburst-driven wind, a mechanically or energy driven active galactic nucleus (AGN) wind, and exposes a molecular MDH wind. These results imply that the nuclear evolution of galaxies and the growth of SMBHs are similar to the growth of hot cores or protostars where gravitational collapse of the nuclear torus drives a MHD wind. These results mean galaxies are capable, in part, of regulating the evolution of their nuclei without feedback.
