  Despite the evidence that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) co-evolve with their host galaxy, and that most of the growth of these SMBHs occurs via merger-free processes, the underlying mechanisms which drive this secular co-evolution are poorly understood. We investigate the role that both strong and weak large-scale galactic bars play in mediating this relationship. Using 72,940 disc galaxies in a volume-limited sample from Galaxy Zoo DESI, we analyse the active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction in strongly barred, weakly barred, and unbarred galaxies up to z = 0.1 over a range of stellar masses and colours. After controlling for stellar mass and colour, we find that the optically selected AGN fraction is 31.6 +/- 0.9 per cent in strongly barred galaxies, 23.3 +/- 0.8 per cent in weakly barred galaxies, and 14.2 +/- 0.6 per cent in unbarred disc galaxies. These are highly statistically robust results, strengthening the tantalising results in earlier works. Strongly barred galaxies have a higher fraction of AGNs than weakly barred galaxies, which in turn have a higher fraction than unbarred galaxies. Thus, while bars are not required in order to grow a SMBH in a disc galaxy, large-scale galactic bars appear to facilitate AGN fuelling, and the presence of a strong bar makes a disc galaxy more than twice as likely to host an AGN than an unbarred galaxy at all galaxy stellar masses and colours.

  Neutral atomic hydrogen and molecular gas in the host galaxies of radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be traced using H I 21-cm and OH-1667 MHz absorption lines to understand the fueling and feedback processes. We present the results of an H I and OH absorption survey with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) towards 40 radio sources of low-intermediate radio luminosity ($\sim$10$^{23}$-10$^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz), red mid-infrared color (W2[4.6 $\mu$m]$-$W3[12 $\mu$m] $&gt;$ 2.5 mag) and redshift up to 0.35. From 13 sources with good data at H I observing frequencies, we report the detection of H I absorption towards 8 sources, 5 of which are new detections including 4 in the redshift range 0.25 to 0.35. Our detection rates are consistent with our previous results with dependence on the star-formation history of the host galaxy reflected in the mid-infrared \textit{WISE} W2$-$W3 colors and the compactness of the radio source. We find no significant dependence of detection rates on radio luminosity or redshift. We also find that H I column densities are anti-correlated with the low-frequency spectral indices ($\alpha_{\rm 150 MHz}^{\rm 1.4 GHz}$, $S_{\nu}\propto \nu^{-\alpha}$). We do not have any detection from 23 sources with good data at OH observing frequencies. However, by stacking the spectra we estimate the 3$\sigma$ upper limit of OH column density to be 2.27$\times$10$^{14}$$T_{\rm ex}$/10 K $\times$1/$f_{\rm c}$ cm$^{-2}$. By stacking the OH spectra for 7 associated H I absorbers, we get a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 3.47$\times$10$^{14}$ $T_{\rm ex}$/10 K $\times$1/$f_{\rm c}$ cm$^{-2}$ on OH column density and 1.78$\times$10$^{-7}$ on [OH]/[H I] ratio.

  AGN bubbles in cool-core galaxy clusters are believed to significantly facilitate the transport of cosmic ray electrons (CRe) throughout the cluster. Recent radio observations are revealing complex morphologies of cluster diffuse emission, potentially linked to interactions between AGN bursts and the cluster environment. We perform three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers and inject a bi-directional jet at the center of the main cluster. Kinetic, thermal, magnetic and CRe energy are included in the jet and we use the two-fluid formalism to model the CRe component. We explore a wide range of cluster merger and jet parameters. We discuss the formation of various wide-angle-tail (WAT) and X-shaped sources in the course of the early evolution of the jet and merger. During the last phase of the evolution, we find that the CR material efficiently permeates the central region of the cluster reaching radii of $\sim1$--2 Mpc within $\sim5$--6 Gyr, depending on the merger mass ratio. We find that solenoidal turbulence dominates during the binary merger and explore the possibility for the CRe jet material to be re-accelerated by super-Alfv\`enic turbulence and contribute to cluster scale radio emission. We find that the emission can be volume-filing, $\gtrsim 70$\%. Finally, we study the merger shock interaction with the CRe material and show that it is unlikely that this material significantly contributes to the radio relic emission associated with the shocks. We suggest that multiple jet outbursts and/or off-center radio galaxies would increase the likelihood of detecting these merger shocks in the radio due to shock re-acceleration.

  We present the results of the X-ray polarimetric analyses performed on unobscured radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), with simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data. The synergy of these instruments is crucial to constrain the X-ray corona physical properties and assess its geometry. In the first two years of operation, three AGN have been observed: significant polarization was detected for NGC 4151 (4.9$\pm$1.1 per cent) and IC 4329A (albeit with less confidence, 3.3$\pm$1.1 per cent), with polarization angles aligned with their radio jets, while only an upper limit was found for MCG-05-23-16 ($&lt;$3.2 per cent). Monte Carlo simulations, conducted to investigate the coronal geometry of these AGN, favor a radially extended corona geometry in NGC 4151 and IC 4329A, a scenario consistent also with MCG-05-23-16, if the disk inclination angle is below 50$^\circ$.
