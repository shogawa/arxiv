  In this paper we combine the Early Science radio continuum data from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey, with optical and near-infrared data and release the cross-matched catalogues. The radio data used in this work covers $0.86$ deg$^2$ of the COSMOS field, reaches a thermal noise of $1.7$ $\mu$Jy/beam and contains $6102$ radio components. We visually inspect and cross-match the radio sample with optical and near-infrared data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) and UltraVISTA surveys. This allows the properties of active galactic nuclei and star-forming populations of galaxies to be probed out to $z \approx 5$. Additionally, we use the likelihood ratio method to automatically cross-match the radio and optical catalogues and compare this to the visually cross-matched catalogue. We find that 94 per cent of our radio source catalogue can be matched with this method, with a reliability of $95$ per cent. We proceed to show that visual classification will still remain an essential process for the cross-matching of complex and extended radio sources. In the near future, the MIGHTEE survey will be expanded in area to cover a total of $\sim$20~deg$^2$; thus the combination of automated and visual identification will be critical. We compare redshift distribution of SFG and AGN to the SKADS and T-RECS simulations and find more AGN than predicted at $z \sim 1$.

  Radiation from stars and AGN plays an important role in galaxy formation and evolution, and profoundly transforms the IGM, CGM &amp; ISM. On-the-fly RT has started being incorporated in cosmological simulations, but the complex, evolving radiation spectra are often crudely approximated with a small number of broad bands with piece-wise constant intensity and a fixed photo-ionisation cross-section. Such a treatment is unable to capture the changes to the spectrum as light is absorbed while it propagates through a medium with non-zero opacity. This can lead to large errors in photo-ionisation and heating rates. We present a novel approach of discretising the radiation field in narrow bands, located at the edges of the typically used bands, in order to capture the power-law slope of the radiation field. In combination with power-law approximations for the photo-ionisation cross-sections, this model allows us to self-consistently combine radiation from sources with different spectra and accurately follow the ionisation states of primordial and metal species through time. The method is implemented in Gasoline2 in connection with Trevr2. We compare our new piece-wise power-law reconstruction to the piece-wise constant method in calculating the primordial chemistry photo-ionisation and heating rates under an evolving UVB and stellar spectrum, and find that our method reduces errors significantly, up to two orders of magnitude in the case of HeII ionisation. We apply our new spectral reconstruction method in RT post-processing of a cosmological zoom-in simulation, including radiation from stars and a live UVB, and find a significant increase in total neutral hydrogen mass in the ISM and the CGM due to shielding of the UVB and a low escape fraction of the stellar radiation. This demonstrates the importance of RT and an accurate spectral approximation in simulating the CGM-galaxy ecosystem.

  The origin of obscuration in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is still an open debate. In particular, it is unclear what drives the relative contributions to the line-of-sight column densities from galaxy-scale and torus-linked obscuration. The latter source is expected to play a significant role in Unification Models, while the former is thought to be relevant in both Unification and Evolutionary Models. In this work, we make use of a combination of cosmological semi-analytic models and semi-empirical prescriptions for the properties of galaxies and AGN, to study AGN obscuration. We consider a detailed object-by-object modelling of AGN evolution, including different AGN light curves (LCs), gas density profiles, and also AGN feedback-induced gas cavities. Irrespective of our assumptions on specific AGN LC or galaxy gas fractions, we find that, on the strict assumption of an exponential profile for the gas component, galaxy-scale obscuration alone can hardly reproduce the fraction of $\log (N_{\rm H}/$cm$^{-2}) \geq 24$ sources at least at $z\lesssim3$. This requires an additional torus component with a thickness that decreases with luminosity to match the data. The torus should be present in all evolutionary stages of a visible AGN to be effective, although galaxy-scale gas obscuration may be sufficient to reproduce the obscured fraction with $22&lt;\log (N_{\rm H}/$cm$^{-2})&lt;24$ (Compton-thin, CTN) if we assume extremely compact gas disc components. The claimed drop of CTN fractions with increasing luminosity does not appear to be a consequence of AGN feedback, but rather of gas reservoirs becoming more compact with decreasing stellar mass.

  A population of binary stellar-mass black hole (BBH) mergers are believed to occur embedded in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this {\em Letter}, we demonstrate that the jets from these BBH mergers can propagate collimatedly within the disk atmosphere along with a forward shock and a reverse shock forming at the jet head. Efficient proton acceleration by these shocks is usually expected before the breakout, leading to the production of TeV$-$PeV neutrinos through interactions between these protons and electron-radiating photons via photon-meson production. AGN BBH mergers occurring in the outer regions of the disk are more likely to produce more powerful neutrino bursts. Taking the host AGN properties of the potential GW190521 electromagnetic (EM) counterpart as an example, one expects $\gtrsim1$ neutrino events detectable by IceCube if the jet is on-axis and the radial location of the merger is $R\gtrsim10^5R_{\rm{g}}$, where $R_{\rm{g}}$ is the gravitational radius of the supermassive BH. Neutrino bursts from AGN BBH mergers could be detected by IceCube following the observation of gravitational waves (GWs), serving as precursor signals before the detection of EM breakout signals. AGN BBH mergers are potential target sources for future joint GW, neutrino, and EM multi-messenger observations.
