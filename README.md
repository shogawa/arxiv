  We present new VLTI/GRAVITY near-infrared interferometric measurements of the angular size of the innermost hot dust continuum for 14 type 1 AGNs. The angular sizes are resolved on scales of ~0.7 mas and the inferred ring radii range from 0.028 to 1.33 pc, comparable to those reported previously and a factor 10-20 smaller than the mid-infrared sizes in the literature. Combining our new data with previously published values, we compile a sample of 25 AGN with bolometric luminosity ranging from $10^{42}$ to $10^{47} \rm erg~s^{-1}$, with which we study the radius-luminosity (R-L) relation for the hot dust structure. Our interferometric measurements of radius are offset by a factor 2 from the equivalent relation derived through reverberation mapping. Using a simple model to explore the dust structure's geometry, we conclude that this offset can be explained if the 2 um emitting surface has a concave shape. Our data show that the slope of the relation is in line with the canonical $R \propto L^{0.5}$ when using an appropriately non-linear correction for bolometric luminosity. In contrast, using optical luminosity or applying a constant bolometric correction to it results in a significant deviation in the slope, suggesting a potential luminosity dependence on the spectral energy distribution. Over four orders of magnitude in luminosity, the intrinsic scatter around the R-L relation is 0.2 dex, suggesting a tight correlation between innermost hot dust structure size and the AGN luminosity.

  The LINER galaxy TXS2226-184 is known to host a very luminous 22 GHz water maser, labeled as 'gigamaser' at the time of its discovery. So far, the nature of this maser is still debated, in particular, if it is associated with a nuclear accretion disk, or with an ejection component, namely a jet or an outflow originating in the AGN. We have obtained multi-band (band 5, 6, and 7) ALMA observations during Cycle 9, with the purpose of investigating the maser nature and the nuclear molecular material in the innermost region of the galaxy. While the full data sets are still under study, a preliminary data reduction and analysis of the band 5 and 7 spectral line cubes, presented in this Letter, offer already a significant outcome. We observed, bright, possibly maser emission from the 183 GHz and 380 GHz transitions in TXS2226-184. This represents the first confident detection of 380 GHz (maser) emission in an extragalactic object. Emission features at both frequencies show a two-peaked line profiles resembling that of the 22 GHz maser features. The mm/sub-mm emission originates from a region coincident, within the errors, with that of the 22 GHz. The similarities in profile and position indicate that the emission at the three frequencies is likely produced by the same nuclear structure, although differences in line strengths and feature peak positions may hint a slightly different physical conditions of the emitting gas. A comparison with the few megamaser sources studied into high-enough details and sharing similarities with the water lines in TXS2226-184, favors a nature associated with amplification of a bright nuclear continuum (from a jet/outflow) through dense and hot gas in front of the nucleus (e.g., a disk or torus), however, a more comprehensive analysis of the available data is necessary to better assess this scenario.

  Precise millisecond pulsar (MSP) positions determined with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) hold the key to building the connection between the kinematic and dynamic reference frames respectively used by VLBI and pulsar timing. The frame connection would provide an important pathway to examining the planetary ephemerides used in pulsar timing, and potentially enhancing the sensitivities of pulsar timing arrays used to detect stochastic gravitational-wave background at nano-Hz regime. We aim at significantly improving the VLBI-based MSP position from its current $\gtrsim1\,$mas precision level by reducing the two dominant components in the positional uncertainty -- the propagation-related uncertainty and the uncertainty resulting from the frequency-dependent core shifts of the reference sources. We introduce a new differential astrometry strategy of using multiple calibrators observed at several widely separated frequencies, which we call PINPT (Phase-screen Interpolation plus frequeNcy-dePendent core shifT correction; read as "pinpoint") for brevity. The strategy allows determination of the core-shift and mitigates the impact of residual delay in the atmosphere. We implemented the strategy on PSR J2222-0137, an MSP well constrained astrometrically with VLBI and pulsar timing. Using the PINPT strategy, we determined core shifts for 4 AGNs around PSR J2222-0137, and derived a VLBI-based pulsar position with uncertainty of 0.17 mas and 0.32 mas in right ascension and declination, respectively, approaching the uncertainty level of the best-determined timing-based MSP positions. The realization of the PINPT strategy promises a factor-of-5 positional precision enhancement (over conventional VLBI astrometry) for all kinds of compact radio sources observed at $\lesssim2$ GHz, including most fast radio bursts.

  We present new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the J1000+0234 system at $z=4.54$, the dense core of a galaxy protocluster hosting a massive, dusty star forming galaxy (DSFG) with a low luminosity radio counterpart. The new data reveals two extended, high equivalent width (EW$_0 &gt; 1000$ {\AA}) nebulae at each side of the DSFG disk along its minor axis (namely O3-N and O3-S). On one hand, O3-N's spectrum shows a prominent FWHM $\sim1300$ km s$^{-1}$ broad and blueshifted component, suggesting an outflow origin. On the other hand, O3-S stretches over parsec and has a velocity gradient that spans $800$ km s$^{-1}$ but no evidence of a broad component. Both sources, however, seem to be powered at least partially by an active galactic nucleus (AGN), so we classify them as extended emission-line regions (EELRs). The strongest evidence comes from the detection of the high-ionization [Ne V] $\lambda3427$ line toward O3-N, which paired with the non-detection of hard X-rays implies an obscuring column density above the Compton-thick regime. In O3-S, the [Ne V] line is not detected, but we measure a He II well above the expectation for star formation. We interpret this as O3-S being externally irradiated by the AGN, akin to the famous Hanny's Voorwerp object in the local Universe. In addition, more classical line ratio diagnostics (e.g. [O III]/H$\beta$ vs [N II]/H$\alpha$) put the DSFG itself in the AGN region of the diagrams, and hence the most probable host of the AGN. These results showcase the ability of JWST of unveiling highly obscured AGN at high redshifts.

  Our understanding of highly accreting AGNs is hampered by the lack of a complete systematic investigation in terms of their main spectral and variability properties, and by the relative paucity of them in the local Universe, especially those powered by supermassive black holes with $M_\mathrm{BH} &gt; 10^8\,M_\odot$. To overcome this limitation, we present here the X-ray spectral analysis of a new, large sample of 61 highly accreting AGNs named as the \emph{XMM-Newton} High-Eddington Serendipitous AGN Sample, or X-HESS, obtained by cross-correlating the 11th release of the \emph{XMM-Newton} serendipitous catalogue and the catalogue of spectral properties of quasars from the SDSS DR14. The X-HESS AGNs are spread across wide intervals with a redshift of $0.06&lt;z&lt;3.3$, a black hole mass of $6.8&lt;\log(M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\odot)&lt;9.8$, a bolometric luminosity of $44.7&lt;\log(L_\mathrm{bol}/\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1})&lt;48.3$, and an Eddington ratio of $-0.2&lt;\log\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}&lt;0.5$, and more than one third of these AGNs can rely on multiple observations at different epochs, allowing us to investigate also their variability. We find a large scatter in the $\Gamma - \lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ distribution of the highly accreting X-HESS AGNs. A significant correlation is only found by considering a sample of lower-\ledd\ AGNs with $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}\lesssim0.3$. The $\Gamma - \lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ relation appears to be more statistically sound for AGNs with lower $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and/or $L_\mathrm{bol}$. We investigate the possibility of transforming the $\Gamma - \lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ plane into a fully epoch-dependent frame by calculating the Eddington ratio from the simultaneous optical/UV data from the optical monitor, $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd,O/UV}$. Finally, we also get a mild indication of a possible anti-correlation between $\Gamma$ and the strength of the soft excess.
