  The origin of cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) dichotomy of galaxy clusters remains uncertain. Previous simulations have found that cluster mergers are effective in destroying CCs but fail to prevent overcooling in cluster cores when radiative cooling is included. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising mechanism for balancing cooling in CCs; however, the role of AGN feedback in CC/NCC transitions remains elusive. In this work, we perform three-dimensional binary cluster merger simulations incorporating AGN feedback and radiative cooling, aiming to investigate the heating effects from mergers and AGN feedback on CC destruction. We vary the mass ratio and impact parameter to examine the entropy evolution of different merger scenarios. We find that AGN feedback is essential in regulating the merging clusters, and that CC destruction depends on the merger parameters. Our results suggest three scenarios regarding CC/NCC transitions: (1) CCs are preserved in minor mergers or mergers that do not trigger sufficient heating, in which cases AGN feedback is crucial for preventing the cooling catastrophe; (2) CCs are transformed into NCCs by major mergers during the first core passage, and AGN feedback is subdominant; (3) in major mergers with a large impact parameter, mergers and AGN feedback operate in concert to destroy the CCs.

  The aim of this work is to study the position of gas-rich and gas-poor galaxy clusters within the large-scale structure and, in particular, their distance to filaments. Our sample is built from 29 of the 34 clusters in the X-ray unbiased cluster sample (XUCS), a velocity-dispersion-selected sample for which various properties, including masses, gas fractions, and X-ray surface brightness were available in the literature. We compute the projected distance between each cluster and the spine of the nearest filament with the same redshift and investigate the link between this distance and the previously-mentioned properties of the clusters, in particular with their gas content. The average distance between clusters and filaments is larger for low X-ray surface brightness clusters than for those of high surface brightness, with intermediate brightness clusters being an intermediate case. Also the minimum distance follows a similar trend, with rare cases of low surface brightness clusters found at distances smaller than 2 Mpc from the spine of filaments. However, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test is not able to exclude the null hypothesis that the two distributions are coming from the same parent one. We speculate that the position of galaxy clusters within the cosmic web could have a direct impact in their gas mass fraction, hence on its X-ray surface brightness, since the presence of a filament can oppose resistance to the outward flow of gas induced by the central AGN and reduce the time required for this gas to fall inward after the AGN is shut. However, a larger sample of clusters is needed in order to derive a statistically-robust conclusion
