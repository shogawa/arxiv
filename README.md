  The classifications of Fermi-LAT unassociated sources are studied using multiple machine learning (ML) methods. The update data from 4FGL-DR3 are divided into high Galactic latitude (HGL, Galactic latitude $|b|&gt;10^\circ$) and low Galactic latitude (LGL, $|b|\le10^\circ$) regions. In the HGL region, a voting ensemble of four binary ML classifiers achieves a 91$\%$ balanced accuracy. In the LGL region, an additional Bayesian-Gaussian (BG) model with three parameters is introduced to eliminate abnormal soft spectrum AGNs from the training set and ML-identified AGN candidates, a voting ensemble of four ternary ML algorithms reach an 81$\%$ balanced accuracy. And then, a catalog of Fermi-LAT all-sky unassociated sources is constructed. Our classification results show that (i) there are 1037 AGN candidates and 88 pulsar candidates with a balanced accuracy of $0.918 \pm 0.029$ in HGL region, which are consistent with those given in previous all-sky ML approaches; and (ii) there are 290 AGN-like candidates, 135 pulsar-like candidates, and 742 other-like candidates with a balanced accuracy of $0.815 \pm 0.027$ in the LGL region, which are different from those in previous all-sky ML approaches. Additionally, different training sets and class weights were tested for their impact on classifier accuracy and predicted results. The findings suggest that while different training approaches can yield similar model accuracy, the predicted numbers across different categories can vary significantly. Thus, reliable evaluation of the predicted results is deemed crucial in the ML approach for Fermi-LAT unassociated sources.

  The variable continuum emission of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) produces corresponding responses in the broad emission lines, which are modulated by light travel delays, and contain information on the physical properties, structure, and kinematics of the emitting gas region. The reverberation mapping technique, a time series analysis of the driving light curve and response, can recover some of this information, including the size and velocity field of the broad line region (BLR). Here we introduce a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code (BELMAC), which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to any given input light curve by setting up a 3D ensemble of gas clouds for various specified geometries, velocity fields, and cloud properties. In this work, we present numerical approximations to the transfer function by simulating the velocity-resolved responses to a single continuum pulse for sets of models representing a spherical BLR with a radiatively driven outflow and a disk-like BLR with Keplerian rotation. We explore how the structure, velocity field, and other BLR properties affect the transfer function. We calculate the response-weighted time delay (reverberation "lag"), which is considered to be a proxy for the luminosity-weighted radius of the BLR. We investigate the effects of anisotropic cloud emission and matter-bounded (completely ionized) clouds and find the response-weighted delay is only equivalent to the luminosity-weighted radius when clouds emit isotropically and are radiation-bounded (partially ionized). Otherwise, the luminosity-weighted radius can be overestimated by up to a factor of 2.

  The observability of afterglows from binary neutron star mergers, occurring within AGN disks is investigated. We perform 3D GRMHD simulations of a post-merger system, and follow the jet launched from the compact object. We use semi-analytic techniques to study the propagation of the blast wave powered by the jet through an AGN disk-like external environment, extending to distances beyond the disk scale height. The synchrotron emission produced by the jet-driven forward shock is calculated to obtain the afterglow emission. The observability of this emission at different frequencies is assessed by comparing it to the quiescent AGN emission. In the scenarios where the afterglow could temporarily outshine the AGN, we find that detection will be more feasible at higher frequencies (&gt; 10^(14) Hz) and the electromagnetic counterpart could manifest as a fast variability in the AGN emission, on timescales less than a day.

  We present a study of molecular gas, traced via CO (3-2) from ALMA data, of four z&lt; 0.2, `radio quiet', type 2 quasars (log [L(bol)/(erg/s)] = 45.3 - 46.2; log [L(1.4 GHz)/(W/Hz)] = 23.7 - 24.3). Targets were selected to have extended radio lobes (&gt;= 10 kpc), and compact, moderate-power jets (1 - 10 kpc; log [Pjet/(erg/s)]= 43.2 - 43.7). All targets show evidence of central molecular outflows, or injected turbulence, within the gas disks (traced via high-velocity wing components in CO emission-line profiles). The inferred velocities (Vout = 250 - 440 km/s) and spatial scales (0.6 - 1.6 kpc), are consistent with those of other samples of luminous low-redshift AGN. In two targets, we observe extended molecular gas structures beyond the central disks, containing 9 - 53 % of the total molecular gas mass. These structures tend to be elongated, extending from the core, and wrap-around (or along) the radio lobes. Their properties are similar to the molecular gas filaments observed around radio lobes of, mostly `radio loud', Brightest Cluster Galaxies. They have: projected distances of 5 - 13 kpc; bulk velocities of 100 - 340 km/s; velocity dispersion of 30 - 130 km/s; inferred mass outflow rates of 4 - 20 Msolar/yr; and estimated kinetic powers of log [Ekin/(erg/s)]= 40.3 - 41.7. Our observations are consistent with simulations that suggest moderate-power jets can have a direct (but modest) impact on molecular gas on small scales, through direct jet-cloud interactions. Then, on larger scales, jet-cocoons can push gas aside. Both processes could contribute to the long-term regulation of star formation.
