  We present chemical abundance ratios of 70 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim4$-10 observed by the JWST/NIRSpec ERO, GLASS, and CEERS programs. Among the 70 galaxies, we have pinpointed 2 galaxies, CEERS_01019 at $z=8.68$ and GLASS_150008 at $z=6.23$, with extremely low C/N ([C/N]$\lesssim -1$), evidenced with CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,1909, NIII]$\lambda$1750, and NIV]$\lambda\lambda$1483,1486, which show high N/O ratios ([N/O]$\gtrsim 0.5$) comparable with the one of GN-z11. CEERS_01019 (GLASS_150008) has (does not have) a strong high ionization line that is explained by AGN (star-formation) photoionization models, which is (not) similar to GN-z11. Such low C/N and high N/O ratios found in CEERS_01019 and GLASS_150008 (additionally identified in GN-z11) are close to the equilibrium of the CNO cycle, suggesting that these 3 galaxies are enriched by metals processed by the CNO cycle. On the C/N vs. O/H plane, these 3 galaxies do not coincide with Galactic HII regions, normal star-forming galaxies, and nitrogen-loud quasars with AGB stars, but globular-cluster (GC) stars, indicating a connection with GC formation. We compare C/O and N/O of these 3 galaxies with those of theoretical models, and find that these 3 galaxies are explained by scenarios with dominant CNO-cycle materials, i.e. Wolf-Rayet stars, supermassive ($10^{3}-10^{5}\ M_{\odot}$) stars, and tidal disruption events, interestingly with a requirement of frequent direct collapses. For all the 70 galaxies, we present measurements of Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O, together with C/O and N/O. We identify 4 galaxies with very low Ne/O, $\log(\rm Ne/O)&lt;-1.0$, indicating abundant massive ($\gtrsim30\ M_\odot$) stars.

  Transient accretion events onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs), such as Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), Bowen Fluorescence Flares (BFFs), and active galactic nuclei (AGN) sudden increases of activity, offer a new window into the SMBH population, accretion physics and stellar dynamics in galaxy centers. However, such transients are rare, and finding them in wide-field transient surveys is challenging. Here we present the results of a systematic real-time search for SMBH-related transients in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public alerts, using various search queries. We examined 345 rising events coincident with a galaxy nucleus, with no history of previous activity, of which 223 were spectroscopically classified. Of those, 5 (2.2%) were TDEs, 1 (0.5%) was a BFF and 2 (0.9%) AGN flares. Limiting the search to blue events brighter than magnitude 19, the fraction of TDEs more than doubles to 5.2%. Limiting the search further to candidate post-starburst galaxies increases the relative number of TDEs to 20%, but the absolute numbers in such a search are small. The main contamination source is supernovae (95.1% of the events), of which the majority (82.2% of supernovae) are of Type Ia. In a comparison set of 39 events with limited photometric history, the AGN contamination increases to ~30%. Host galaxy offset is not a significant discriminant of TDEs in current ZTF data, but might be useful in higher resolution data. Our results can be used to quantify the efficiency of various SMBH-related transient search strategies in optical surveys such as ZTF and LSST.

  Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) having relativistic jets aligned within a few degrees of our line-of-sight and form the majority of the AGN detected in the TeV regime. The Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a pair-conversion telescope, sensitive to photons having energies between 20 MeV and 2 TeV, and is capable of scanning the entire gamma-ray sky every three hours. Despite the remarkable success of the Fermi mission, many questions still remain unanswered, such as the site of gamma-ray production and the emission mechanisms involved. The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) is a high cadence all sky survey system optimized to be efficient for finding potentially dangerous asteroids, as well as in tracking and searching for highly variable and transient sources, such as AGN. In this study, we investigate possible correlations between the Fermi-LAT observations in the 100 MeV-300 GeV energy band and the ATLAS optical data in the R-band, centered at 679 nm, for a sample of 18 TeV-detected northern blazars over 8 years of observations between 2015 and 2022. Under the assumption that the optical and gamma-ray flares are produced by the same outburst propagating down the jet, the strong correlations found for some sources suggest a single-zone leptonic model of emission.

  It has been argued that recycled gas from stellar mass loss in galaxies might serve as an important fuelling source for black holes (BHs) in their centers. Utilizing spectroscopic samples of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at $z = 0-0.35$ and the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey at $z = 0.6-1$ that have X-ray coverage from XMM-Newton or Chandra, we test this stellar mass loss fuelling scenario by investigating how AGN activity and BH growth vary with the break strength at 4000 $\r{A}$, $\rm D_{n}4000$ (which is closely related to the age of stellar populations), as younger galaxies are considered to have higher stellar mass loss rates. We found that when controlling for host-galaxy properties, the fraction of log $L_{\rm X}$/$M_\star$ &gt; 32 (which roughly corresponds to Eddington ratios $\gtrsim 1$%) AGN and sample-averaged black hole accretion rate ($\rm \overline{BHAR}$) decrease with $\rm D_{n}4000$ among $\rm D_{n}4000$ $\lesssim$ 1.9 galaxies, suggesting a higher level of AGN activity among younger galaxies, which supports the stellar mass loss fuelling scenario. For the oldest and most massive galaxies at $z = 0-0.35$, this decreasing trend is not present anymore. We found that, among these most massive galaxies at low redshift, the fraction of low specific-accretion-rate (31 $&lt;$ log $L_{\rm X}$/$M_\star$ $&lt;$ 32) AGNs increases with $\rm D_{n}4000$, which may be associated with additional fuelling from hot halo gas and/or enhanced accretion capability.
