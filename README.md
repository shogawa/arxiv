  Resolved measurements of gas-phase metallicities in galaxies that both do and do not host active galactic nuclei (AGN) are crucial for understanding the role of AGN in regulating galaxy growth over cosmic time. Recent work at $z=0$ has demonstrated that a self-consistent comparison of metallicities in AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies can be conducted within a Bayesian framework given sufficient coverage of rest-frame optical emission lines. The next generation of adaptive optics-assisted optical and near-infrared integral field spectrographs promise to deliver the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution required conduct comparable measurements at intermediate redshift ($z\sim 1-3$), albeit with a restricted set of emission lines dictated by the various filter and grating combinations available. In this work, we explore optimal strategies for recovering the metallicities of both AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies given these constraints. We consider suites of emission lines that will be practical to obtain at different redshifts, and test a range of strategies to measure metallicity using just these lines, evaluating their performance by comparison to measurements using all the lines to which we have access in $z=0$ optical spectra. Our results facilitate straightforward estimates of exposure times required by future instruments to reach specified accuracy goals in a range of redshift windows using optimal sets of lines, enabling the development of efficient observing strategies for future surveys. This study can be extended to spatially resolved galaxies in order to design optimal strategies for measuring metallicity fluctuation maps in addition to the mean metallicities we consider here.

  X-ray emission arising from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity may potentially mimic the expected emission of Tidal disruption events (TDEs). Ongoing and upcoming wide-field X-ray surveys will detect thousands of TDE-like sources, and classifying them securely as TDEs or AGNs is a challenging task. To this aim, we measure the average X-ray variability of AGNs and derive a threshold of maximum variation as a function of time separating the TDEs from AGN flares. For the comparison between TDE and AGN X-ray variability, we cross-match the publicly available XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT point source catalogs with the Million Quasars Catalog and optically selected TDEs. Then we compute the X-ray structure function (SF) and maximum variability of the AGN and TDE samples. The X-ray SF of AGNs has a power-law index $\gamma\sim0.11-0.14$ when fitted with a simple power-law model. However, the SF of AGNs is best described by a broken power-law or a power exponential model with a damping time scale $\tau=950\pm300$ days. The maximum variability comparison between TDE and simulated AGN light curves indicates they have a similar order of variation on a time scale of less than 20 days. However, at a longer time scale of ~20 days or more, the large-scale variations expected from power-law-like decay in TDEs become less frequent in AGNs. Furthermore, we compare the maximum variability of eROSITA TDE candidates with AGN, finding that many of the eROSITA-DE TDE candidates are consistent with flares from AGNs, and may not be TDEs.   

Jet collimation in a spiral-hosted AGN: a parabolic jet profile in
  0313-192

  Double-lobed radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs) are typically found in elliptical galaxies, while supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies rarely produce powerful kpc-scale jets. However, the growing number of spiral- and disk-hosted DRAGNs challenges this classical dichotomy. We present a study of the jet collimation profile for one such source, 0313-192, using VLBA and VLA data, tracing the jet morphology across nearly five orders of magnitude in scale -- from $\sim$ pc to $\sim100$ kpc (projected). We find that the jet exhibits a parabolic expansion up to $\sim 610$ pc ($\sim 7.9 \times 10^6$ Schwarzschild radii), followed by a transition to a nearly conical shape, assuming kpc-scale emission primarily originates from the jet rather than the lobe. This structural evolution closely resembles those in AGNs hosted by elliptical galaxies and provides an explanation for how the jet in this system could extend to large distances by magnetohydrodynamic collimation and acceleration. However, this collimation break occurs beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH ($\sim7.3\times10^{5} R_{S}$), and no extended X-ray halos or dense molecular gas structures are detected to provide the necessary external pressure. Therefore we suggest that jet confinement in 0313-192 is mediated by contributions from non-thermal components, such as ram and magnetic pressure from magnetized disk winds. These mechanisms may enable jet collimation even in the absence of dense ambient gas. Our results highlight how large-scale jets can arise in disk galaxies under rare conditions and demonstrate the need to broaden studies of AGN jet formation beyond traditional models.
