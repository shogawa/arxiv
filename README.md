  We use the Hubble Space Telescope to analyse the extended [O III] 5007A emission in seven bright radio-quiet type 1 quasars (QSO1s), focusing on the morphology and physical conditions of their extended Narrow-Line Regions (NLRs). We find NLRs extending 3-9 kpc, with four quasars showing roughly symmetrical structures (b/a=1.2-1.5) and three displaying asymmetric NLRs (b/a=2.4-5.6). When included with type 1 and type 2 AGNs from previous studies, the sizes of the extended [O III] regions scale with luminosity as $R[O III] \sim L[O III]^{0.5}$, consistent with photoionisation. However, when analysed separately, type 1s exhibit a steeper slope ($\gamma=0.57\pm0.05$) compared to type 2 AGNs ($\gamma=0.48\pm0.02$). We use photoionisation modeling to estimate the maximum NLRs sizes, assuming a minimum ionisation parameter of $\log(U) = -3$, an ionising luminosity based on the $L[O III]$-derived bolometric luminosity, and a minimum gas number density $n_H \sim 100\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, assuming that molecular clouds provide a reservoir for the ionised gas. The derived sizes agree well with direct measurements for a sample of type 2 quasars, but are underestimated for the current sample of QSO1s. A better agreement is obtained for the QSO1s using bolometric luminosities derived from the 5100A continuum luminosity. Radial mass profiles for the QSO1s show significant extended mass in all cases, but with less [O III]-emitting gas near the central AGN compared to QSO2s. This may suggest that the QSO1s are in a later evolutionary stage than QSO2s, further past the blow-out stage.

  We report the discovery of eight new recurrent changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including seven re-brightening turn-off AGNs and one fading turn-on AGN. These systems are valuable for placing constraints on the duration of dim and bright states, which may be linked to the AGN duty cycle or disk instability. Long-term optical light curve analysis reveals that many objects in our sample exhibit a prolonged plateau during the dim states lasting 4 to 7 years, with gradual turn-on/off process. We observe no significant difference between the turn-on and turn-off timescales, and this timescale is broadly consistent with the heating/cooling front propagation timescale. The comparison between optical and infrared variations supports that these transitions are driven by changes in accretion disk emission rather than dust obscuration. Our discovery significantly increases the previously identified recurrent CL AGN sample from eleven objects to nineteen, demonstrating that some AGNs can enter dormancy and reawaken on timescales of a few years, which provides useful information for understanding AGN episodic accretion.

  In this paper, we attempt to explain the TeV-PeV neutrinos observed by IceCube assuming that their sources are active galactic nuclei (AGN). The results are obtained in the model where the accretion disc emits in the UV-optical range inside the electron plasma cloud. Using the Monte-Carlo approach to model photopion interactions in jets and then after taking into account the cosmological evolution it is shown that the resulting spectrum can explain the observed neutrino flux.

  Burst searches identify gravitational-wave (GW) signals in the detector data without use of a specific signal model, unlike the matched-filter searches that correlate data with simulated signal waveforms (templates). While matched filters are optimal for detection of known signals in the Gaussian noise, the burst searches can be more efficient in finding unusual events not covered by templates or those affected by non-Gaussian noise artifacts. Here, we report the detection of 3 gravitational wave signals that are uncovered by a burst search Coherent WaveBurst (cWB) optimized for the detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. They were found in the data from the LIGO/Virgo's third observing run (O3) with a combined significance of 3.6 $\sigma$. Each event appears to be a BBH merger not previously reported by the LIGO/Virgo's matched-filter searches. The most significant event has a reconstructed primary component in the upper mass gap ($m_1 = 70^{+36}_{-18}\,$M$_\odot$), and unusually low mass ratio ($m_2/m_1\sim0.3$), implying a dynamical or AGN origin. The 3 new events are consistent with the expected number of cWB-only detections in the O3 run ($4.8 \pm 2.1$), and belong to the stellar-mass binary population with the total masses in the $70-100$ M$_\odot$ range.

  In this Letter, we investigate the turbulence and energy injection in the extended nebulae surrounding two luminous obscured quasars, WISEA J100211.29$+$013706.7 ($z=1.5933$) and SDSS J165202.64$+$172852.3 ($z=2.9489$). Utilizing high-resolution data from the NIRSpec IFU onboard the James Webb Space Telescope, we analyze the velocity fields of line-emitting gas in and around these quasars and construct the second-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) to quantify turbulent motions across different spatial scales. Our findings reveal a notable flattening in the VSFs from $\approx\!3$ kpc up to a scale of 10--20 kpc, suggesting that energy injection predominantly occurs at a scale $\lesssim$10 kpc, likely powered by quasar outflows and jet-driven bubbles. The extended spatial range of flat VSFs may also indicate the presence of multiple energy injection sources at these scales. For J1652, the turbulent energy in the host interstellar medium (ISM) is significantly higher than in tidally stripped gas, consistent with the expectation of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activities stirring up the host ISM. Compared to the VSFs observed on spatial scales of 10--50 kpc around lower-redshift UV-bright quasars, these obscured quasars exhibit higher turbulent energies in their immediate surroundings, implying different turbulence drivers between the ISM and halo-scale gas. Future studies with an expanded sample are essential to elucidate further the extent and the pivotal role of AGNs in shaping the gas kinematics of host galaxies and beyond.

  We use NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging to study a sample of 18 massive ($\log\; M_{*}/M_{\odot} \gt 10\;$dex), central quiescent galaxies at $2\leq z \leq 5$ in the GOODS fields, to investigate their number density, star-formation histories, quenching timescales, and incidence of AGN. The depth of our data reaches $\log M_*/M_\odot \approx 9\;$dex, yet the least-massive central quiescent galaxy found has $\log M_*/M_\odot \gt 10\;$dex, suggesting that quenching is regulated by a physical quantity that scales with $M_*$. With spectroscopy as benchmark, we assess the completeness and purity of photometric samples, finding number densities 10 times higher than predicted by galaxy formation models, confirming earlier photometric studies. We compare our number densities to predictions from FLAMINGO, the largest-box full-hydro simulation suite to date. We rule out cosmic variance at the 3-$\sigma$ level, providing spectroscopic confirmation that galaxy formation models do not match observations at $z&gt;3$. Using FLAMINGO, we find that the vast majority of quiescent galaxies' stars formed in situ, with these galaxies not having undergone multiple major dry mergers. This is in agreement with the compact observed size of these systems and suggests that major mergers are not a viable channel for quenching most massive galaxies. Several of our observed galaxies are particularly old, with four galaxies displaying 4000-\r{A} breaks; full-spectrum fitting infers formation and quenching redshifts of $z\geq8$ and $z\geq6$. Using all available AGN tracers, we find that 8 massive quiescent galaxies host AGN, including in old systems. This suggests a high duty cycle of AGN and a continued trickle of gas to fuel accretion.

  Fast, massive winds are ubiquitously observed in the UV and X-ray spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and other accreting sources. Theoretical and observational evidences suggest they are launched at accretion disc scales, carrying significant mass and angular momentum. Thanks to such high energy output, they may play an important role in transferring the accretion energy to the surrounding environment. In the case of AGNs, this process can help setting the so-called coevolution between the AGN and its host galaxy. To precisely assess the effective role of these winds, it is necessary to accurately measure their properties, including mass and energy rates. We aim to maximise the scientific return of current and future observations by improving the theoretical modelling of these winds through our Winds in the Ionised Nuclear Environment (WINE) model. WINE is a spectroscopic model designed for disc winds in AGNs and compact accreting sources, which couples photoionisation and radiative transfer with special relativistic effects and a three-dimensional model of the emission profiles. We explore with WINE the main spectral features associated to AGN disc winds, with particular emphasis on the detectability of the wind emission. We simulate observations with the X-ray microcalorimeters Resolve on board the XRISM satellite and the future Athena's X-IFU for the typical properties and exposure times of the sources in the XRISM Performance Verification phase. The wind kinematic, geometry, ionisation and column density deeply affect shape and strength of the spectral features. Thanks to this, both Resolve and X-IFU will be able to accurately constrain the main properties of disc winds in a broad range of parameters. We also find a dramatic difference in the gas opacity when using a soft, Narrow Line Seyfert 1-like SED compared to a canonical powerlaw SED with spectral index Gamma=2.
