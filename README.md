  In the innermost regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), matter is understood to be flowing onto the Supermassive black hole (SMBH), which forms an accretion disk. This disk is responsible for the optical/UV continuum emission observed in the spectra of AGN. Reverberation Mapping of the accretion disk using multiple bands can yield the structure of the disk. The emission is expected to be of the black body type peaking at different wavelengths. Hence, depending on the temperature of the disk, continuous, simultaneous monitoring in multiple wavelength ranges to cover hotter inner regions and cooler outer regions can yield the structure and temperature profile of the accretion disk itself. In this study, we present initial results from our accretion disk reverberation mapping campaign targeting AGN with Super High Eddington Accreting Black Holes (SEAMBH). Our analysis on one of the sources- IRAS 04416+1215; based on the broadband observations using the Growth India telescope (GIT), reveals that the size of the accretion disk for this source, calculated by cross-correlating the continuum light curves is larger than expected from the theoretical model. We fit the light curves directly using the thin disk model available in {\sc javelin} and find that the disk sizes are approximately 4 times larger than expected from the Shakura Sunyaev (SS) disk model. Further studies are needed to understand better the structure and physics of AGN accretion disks and their role in the evolution of galaxies.

  The recent discovery of enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe), characterized by physical extents $&gt;200$ kpc and Ly$\alpha$ luminosities $&gt;10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, provide a unique opportunity to study the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium (IGM/CGM) in distant galaxies. Many existing ELANe detections are associated with local overdensities of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We have initiated a search for ELANe around regions containing pairs of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) using the Palomar Cosmic Web Imager (PCWI). The first study of this search, Cai et al., presented results of ELAN0101+0201 which was associated with a QSO pair at $z=2.45$. In this study, all targets residing in QSO pair environments analyzed have Ly$\alpha$ detections, but only one of the four targets meets the classification criteria of an ELANe associated with a QSO pair region (z$\sim2.87$). The other three sample detections of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae do not meet the size and luminosity criteria to be classified as ELANe. We find kinematic evidence that the ELANe J1613, is possibly powered {mostly by AGN outflows.} The analysis of circularly-averaged surface brightness profiles of emission from the Ly$\alpha$ regions show that the {Ly$\alpha$ emission around $z\sim2$ QSO pairs is consistent with emission around individual QSOs at $z\sim2$, which is fainter than that around $z\sim3$ QSOs. A larger sample of Ly$\alpha$ at z$\sim$2 will be needed to determine if there is evidence of redshift evolution when compared to nebular emissions at z$\sim$3 from other studies.
