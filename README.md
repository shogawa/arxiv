  Using SDSS spectra, we applied an automatic method to search for outflows (OFs) in three large samples of narrow-line AGN at low redshifts (z &lt; 0.4), separated in three spectral activity classes: radio-loud RG, 15,793, radio-quiet, Sy2, 18,585, and LINER, 25,656. In general, the probability of detecting an OF decreases along the sequence Sy1-&gt;Sy2-&gt;LINER/RG and, independently of the AGN class, the wind velocity, traced by W80, increases with the AGN luminosity. Moreover W80 is systematically higher in RG or any of the other AGN class when detected in radio. These results support the idea that there are two main modes of production of OF, the radiative mode dominant in radio-quiet AGN and the jet mode dominant in radio-loud galaxies, although both modes could also happen simultaneously at different levels. From the spectra and SDSS photometry, the characteristics of the AGN host galaxies and their super-massive black holes (SMBHs) were also retrieved using the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT. This revealed that, independently of their spectral class, 1) galaxy hosts with OFs have systematically later morphological types and higher star formation rates than their counterpart without OF, 2) they occupy different positions in the specific diagnostic diagram, sSMBH vs. sSFR, which suggests they follow different evolutionary paths congruent with the morphology of their galaxy hosts, and 3) they show no evidence of AGN quenching or triggering of star formation. These results are consistent with a scenario explaining the different AGN classes as consequences of different formation processes of galaxies: early-type galaxies (LINER and RG) formed bigger bulges and more massive SMBHs, exhausting their reservoir of gas more rapidly than late-type galaxies (Sy2 and Sy1), quenching their star formation and starving their SMBHs.

  Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are widely considered potential hosts for various high-energy transients, including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The reactivation of GRB central engines can provide additional energy to shocks formed during the interaction of the initially ejected GRB jets with the circumburst material, commonly referred to as energy injections. In this paper, we study GRBs occurring in AGN disks within the context of energy injections. We adopt the standard external forward shock (EFS) model and consider both short- and long-duration GRB scenarios. Light curves for two types of radiation, namely the radiation from the heated disk material (RHDM) and GRB afterglows, are computed. We find that the energy injection facilitates the EFS to break out from the photosphere of the low-density AGN disk at relativistic velocity. Moreover, the energy injection almost does not affect the RHDM but significantly enhances the peak flux of the GRB afterglows.

  The astrophysical $\gamma$-ray photons carry the signatures of the violent phenomena happening on various astronomical scales in our Universe. This includes supernova remnants, pulsars, and pulsar wind nebulae in the Galactic environment and extragalactic relativistic jets associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, $\sim$30\% of the \gm-ray sources detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope lack multiwavelength counterpart association, precluding us from characterizing their origin. Here we report, for the first time, the association of a collisional ring galaxy system in our Galactic neighborhood (distance $\sim$10 Mpc), formed as a consequence of a smaller `bullet' galaxy piercing through a larger galaxy, as the multi-frequency counterpart of an unassociated $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL~J1647.5$-$5724. The system, also known as "Kathryn's Wheel", contains two dwarf irregular galaxies and an edge-on, late-type, spiral galaxy surrounded by a ring of star-forming knots. We utilized observations taken from the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory, Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, SuperCOSMOS H$\alpha$ Survey, Dark Energy Survey, and Visible MultiObject Spectrograph at Very Large Telescope to ascertain the association with 4FGL~J1647.5$-$5724 and to explore the connection between the star-forming activities and the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. We found that star-formation alone cannot explain the observed $\gamma$-ray emission, and additional contribution likely from the pulsars/supernova remnants or buried AGN is required. We conclude that arcsecond/sub-arcsecond-scale observations of this extraordinary $\gamma$-ray emitting galaxy collision will be needed to resolve the environment and explore the origin of cosmic rays.
