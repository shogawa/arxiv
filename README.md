  The study of morphology in galaxies offers a convenient and quantitative method to measure the shapes and characteristics of galaxy light distribution that reflect the evolutionary history. For AGN-host dwarf galaxies, however, there is a lack of detailed studies on their morphologies. In this work, we compile a relatively large sample ($\sim$400 members) of local AGN-host dwarf ($M_{\star}\leq10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ and $z&lt;0.055$) galaxies selected via various methods. We use the $grz$ bands images from DESI DR10 and the Python package statmorph to measure non-parametric coefficients. We also carry out visual inspection with the assistance of deep learning to classify these galaxies into early-type (ETGs), late-type (LTGs) galaxies, and mergers, and find that about 37%, 44%, and 13% of the total sample sources are ETGs, LTGs, and mergers, respectively. In comparison to normal dwarf galaxies, AGN-host dwarfs have a higher probability to be LTGs, and a lower merger rate, indicating that mergers/interactions are not the primary driver of AGN activities. Among the subsamples selected with different methods, the BPT sample has the highest fraction of ETGs, the variability sample consists of the largest fraction of LTGs, and the mid-IR sample contains the most mergers.

  Dynamics of stellar mass black holes (sBHs) embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could produce highly eccentric orbits near the central supermassive black hole, leading to repeated close encounters that emit gravitational waves in the LIGO frequency band. Many works have focused on the mergers of sBH in the disk that produce gravitational waves; however, sBHs in hyperbolic orbits also emit gravitational-wave \bremss{} that can be detected by ground-based interferometers like LIGO. In this work, we analyze the scattering of sBHs in an AGN disk as they migrate inside the disk, focusing on gravitational-wave \bremss{} emission. We determine how the gravitational-wave emission depends on the different parameters of the scattering experiments, such as the mass of the supermassive black hole and the sBH migration rate and mass ratio. We find that scattering with detectable gravitational-wave \bremss{} is more frequent around lower mass SMBHs ($\sim 10^{5-6}$M$_\odot$). We then conduct a suite of Monte Carlo simulations and estimated the rate for ground-based gravitational-wave detections to be in the range of 0.08 - 1194 $\text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{ yr}^{-1}$, depending on migration forces and detection thresholds, with large uncertainties accounting for variations in possible AGN environments. The expected rate for our {\tt Fiducial} parameters is 3.2 $\text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{ yr}^{-1}$. Finally, we provide first-principle gravitational wave templates produced by the encounters.

  Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs) are heavily obscured infrared cores that have been found in local (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). They show bright emission from vibrationally excited rotational transitions of HCN, known as HCN-vib, and are thought to harbor Compton Thick (CT, $N_{\text{H}} \geq 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) or extreme compact starbursts. We explore the potential evolutionary link between CONs and CT AGN by searching for CONs in hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). Here, we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations that targeted HCN-vib emission in four hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN. We analyze these objects together with literature HCN-vib measurements of five additional hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the GOALS sample. We do not detect any CONs in this combined sample of nine CT AGN. We then explore a proposed evolutionary sequence in which CONs evolve into X-ray-detectable CT AGN once outflows and feedback reduce the column densities of the enshrouding gas. We find, however, no evidence of well-developed dense molecular outflows in the observed CT AGN. While this could suggest that CT AGN are not universally linked to CONs, it could also be explained by a short duty cycle for molecular outflows.
