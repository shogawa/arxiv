  The correlation between the X-ray and UV luminosities observed in quasars, spanning a wide redshift range and holding true for several decades in both spectral bands, suggests the presence of a universal mechanism governing the transfer of energy from the accretion disc to the hot corona. In this study, we leverage X-ray spectroscopic data extracted from the Chandra Source Catalog 2.0 for a sample of over $2000$ quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 (SDSS DR14). Our analysis reveals a reduced intrinsic dispersion in the $L_{\rm{X}}-L_{\rm{UV}}$ relation at higher redshifts ($\delta &lt; 0.2$ dex) compared to previous studies relying on photometric data from catalogs. Additionally, our findings confirm the stability of this relation up to redshifts of approximately $4.5$. The $L_{\rm{X}}-L_{\rm{UV}}$ relation can also serve as a tool to investigate the physics of accretion by identifying outliers - sources that exhibit a different state of the accretion disc-hot corona system compared to the average population. For instance, X-ray-weak quasars are sources with reduced X-ray emissions due to a radiatively inefficient state of the corona, and their optical properties suggest the presence of a powerful accretion disc wind. The wealth of spectroscopic data available in the CSC 2.0-SDSS catalogs opens up the opportunity for a more comprehensive exploration of the central engine in AGN.

  Iron K$\alpha$ (Fe K$\alpha$) emission is observed ubiquitously in AGN, and it is a powerful probe of their circumnuclear environment. Examinations of the emission line play a pivotal role in understanding the disk geometry surrounding the black hole. It has been suggested that the torus and the broad line region (BLR) are the origins of emission. However, there is no universal location for the emitting region relative to the BLR. Here, we present an analysis of the narrow component of the Fe K$\alpha$ line in the Seyfert AGN MCG-5-23-16, one of the brightest AGN in X-rays and in Fe K$\alpha$ emission, to localize the emitting region. Spectra derived from Chandra/HETGS observations show asymmetry in the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line, which has only been confirmed before in the AGN NGC 4151. Models including relativistic Doppler broadening and gravitational redshifts are preferred over simple Gaussians and measure radii consistent with $R \simeq$ 200-650 r$_g$. These results are consistent with those of NGC 4151 and indicate that the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line in MCG-5-23-16 is primarily excited in the innermost part of the optical broad line region (BLR), or X-ray BLR. Characterizing the properties of the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line is essential for studying the disk geometries of the AGN population and mapping their innermost regions.
