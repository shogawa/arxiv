  Feedback from AGN is known to affect the host galaxy's evolution. In radio AGN, one manifestation of feedback is seen in gas outflows. However, it is still not well understood whether the effect of feedback evolves with the radio AGN life cycle. In this study, we investigate this link using the radio spectral shape as a proxy for the evolutionary stage of the AGN. We used [OIII] emission line spectra to trace the presence of outflows on the ionised gas. Using a sample of uniformly selected 129 radio AGN with $L_\textrm{1.4GHz}\approx10^{23}-10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, and a mean stacking analysis of the [OIII] profile, we conclude that the ionised gas outflow is linked to the radio spectral shape, and it evolves with the evolution of the radio source. We find that sources with a peak in their radio spectra (optically thick), on average, drive a broad outflow ($FWHM\approx1330\pm418$ km s$^{-1}$) with a velocity $v_\textrm{out}\approx 240$ km s$^{-1}$. However, we detect no outflow in the stacked [OIII] profile of sources without a peak in their radio spectrum. In addition, we find that individual outflow detections are kinematically more extreme in peaked than non-peaked sources. We conclude that radio jets are most effective at driving gas outflows when young, and the outflow is typically short lived. Our stacking analysis shows no significant dependence of the presence of ionised gas outflows on the radio morphology, 1.4 GHz luminosity, optical luminosity and Eddington ratio of these sources. We also identify candidate restarted AGN in our sample, whose [OIII] profiles suggest that they have more disturbed gas kinematics than their evolved counterparts, although the evidence for this is tentative. Our findings support the picture where the impact of AGN feedback changes as the source evolves, and young radio jets interact with the ambient medium, clearing a channel of gas as they expand.

  It has been suggested that there is evidence for cosmological coupling of black holes (BHs) with an index of $k\approx 3$ and hence the BHs serve as the astrophysical source of the dark energy. The data sample however is limited for the redshifts $\leq 2.5$. Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected more than 180 high-redshift Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and quasars. Among the JWST NIRSpec/NIRCam resolved AGNs, three are identified in early-type host galaxies with a redshift $z\sim 4.5-7$. Their $M_{\star}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$, however, are in tension with the prediction of the cosmological coupling of black holes with $k=3$ at a confidence level of $\sim 3\sigma$, which is not in support of the hypothesis that BHs serve as the origin of dark energy. The future observations of high-redshift AGNs by JWST will further test such a hypothesis by identifying more early-type host galaxies in the higher mass range.
