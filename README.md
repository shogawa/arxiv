  We present first results from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and Keck Cosmic Webb Imager (KCWI) integral field spectroscopy of the powerful but highly obscured host-galaxy of the jetted radio source Cygnus A. We detect 169 infrared emission lines at 1.7--27 micron and explore the kinematics and physical properties of the extended narrow-line region (NLR) in unprecedented detail. The density-stratified NLR appears to be shaped by the initial blow-out and ongoing interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, creating a multi-phase bicone with a layered structure composed of molecular and ionized gas. The NLR spectrum, with strong coronal emission at kpc-scale, is well-modeled by AGN photoionization. We find evidence that the NLR is rotating around the radio axis, perhaps mediated by magnetic fields and driven by angular momentum transfer from the radio jet. The overall velocity field of the NLR is well described by 250 km/s outflow along biconical spiral flow lines, combining both rotation and outflow signatures. There is particularly bright [Fe II] 1.644 micron emission from a dense, high-velocity dispersion, photoionized clump of clouds found near the projected radio axis. Outflows of 600--2000 km/s are found in bullets and streamers of ionized gas that may be ablated by the radio jet from these clouds, driving a local outflow rate of 40 Msun/yr.

  Forbidden coronal lines has traditionally called the attention due to the high-energy photons required for their production (IP $&gt;$100~eV, where IP is the ionisation potential of the transitions that originate the line). As such, they are regarded as the most highly ionised component of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). For decades, it was thought that they were only formed in the inner portions of the narrow line region (NLR). Nowadays, due to the larger sensitivity of the detectors and the availability of integral field unit (IFU) spectrographs, that emission in addition to the nuclear component is found to be extended up to a few kiloparsecs away from the active centre. In this review, we highlight the most important aspects of the coronal emission and discuss the recent developments in the field. In particular, we emphasize the discovery that they can be used to determine the mass of the central supermassive black hole, to reconstruct the SED, as well as to trace the most energetic feedback component of the ionised gas in AGN.   

Different physical and numerical sources of scatter in the
  $M_{\star}$-$M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ relation and their connection to galaxy

  Observations have established that the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) correlate tightly with the stellar masses of their host galaxies, albeit with substantial scatter. The size of this scatter as a function of galaxy mass and redshift contains valuable information about the origin of SMBHs and the physical nature of their co-evolution with galaxies. In this work, we highlight this connection by studying the scatter in the $M_{\mathrm{BH}} - M_{\star}$ relation for massive galaxies in the Illustris, IllustrisTNG (TNG), and EAGLE cosmological simulations. We find that the scatter in TNG is significantly lower than in Illustris and EAGLE, reflecting their different BH feedback models. By performing various numerical experiments, we quantify different contributions to the scatter in the simulations, and also identify a suitably defined intrinsic scatter. The intrinsic scatter in Illustris and EAGLE is $\sim0.3$ dex at $z=0$, and is dominated by variations from BH accretion, whereas the smaller scatter of TNG is rather dominated by hierarchical merging, suggesting that the massive galaxies in TNG are more tightly quenched. Variations in the BH seed mass can contribute to the scatter of the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ relation as well, but whether this still plays a role at $z=0$ depends on the feedback model. Simulations with disabled AGN feedback produce much higher scatter for low-mass galaxies than seen in our cosmological simulations, demonstrating the crucial influence of feedback for determining the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies in this regime. In contrast, an important factor in reducing the scatter for massive galaxies is hierarchical merging of mostly quenched systems. Based on our results, we expect that the scatter in the $M_{\mathrm{BH}} - M_{\star}$ relation at high redshift could be particularly powerful in providing clues to the origin of SMBHs.

  We present the results of spectroscopic observations of host galaxies of eleven candidate giant radio galaxies (GRGs), powered by active galactic nuclei (AGNs), conducted with the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). The primary aim of these observations, performed with the Hanle Faint Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC), was to secure accurate spectroscopic redshifts, enabling precise calculations of their projected linear sizes. Based on these measurements, we confirm all eleven sources as giants, with linear sizes ranging from 0.7 to 2.9 Mpc, including ten GRGs and one giant radio quasar (GRQ). One of the GRGs shows evidence of a potential AGN jet-driven ionized outflow, extending up to $\sim$12 kpc, which, if confirmed, would represent a rarely observed feature. Two of the confirmed GRGs exceed 2 Mpc in size, which are relatively rare examples of GRG. The redshifts of the host galaxies span 0.09323 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.41134. Using the obtained spectroscopic data, we characterised their AGN states based on the optical emission line properties. To complement these observations, archival radio and optical survey data were utilised to characterise their large-scale radio morphology and estimate projected linear sizes, arm-length ratios, flux densities, luminosities, and core dominance factors. These results provide new insights into the properties of GRSs and form a critical foundation for further detailed studies of their environments, AGN activity, and evolution using future high-sensitivity optical and radio datasets.

  We report ALMA and ACA observations of atomic carbon ([\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$) and dust continuum in 10 Enormous Ly$\alpha$ Nebulae hosting ultra-luminous Type-I QSOs at $z=2.2-2.5$, as part of the SUrvey of Protocluster ELANe Revealing CO/CI in the Ly$\alpha$ Detected CGM (SUPERCOLD-CGM). We detect [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ and dust in all ten QSOs and five companion galaxies. We find that the QSOs and companions have higher gas densities and more intense radiation fields than Luminous Infrared galaxies and high-$z$ main sequence galaxies, with the highest values found in the QSOs. By comparing molecular gas masses derived from [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$, CO(4$-$3) and dust continuum, we find that the QSOs and companions display a similar low CO conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm CO}$\,$\sim$\,0.8 $\rm M_{\sun}$${[\rm K\,km/s\,pc^2]}^{-1}$. After tapering our data to low resolution, the [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ flux increases for nine QSOs, hinting at the possibility of [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) on a scale of 16$-$40 kpc. However, the [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ sensitivity is too low to confirm this for individual targets, except for a tentative (2.7$\sigma$) CGM detection in Q0050+0051{} with M$_{\rm H_2}$\,=\, ($1.0 - 2.8$)$\times 10^{10}$ $\rm M_{\sun}$. The 3$\sigma$ mass limits of molecular CGM for the remaining QSO fields are ($0.2-1.4$)\,$\times$\,10$^{10}$ $\rm M_{\sun}$. This translates into a baryon fraction of $&lt;$0.4-3$\% $ in the molecular CGM relative to the total baryonic halo mass. Our sample also includes a radio-detected AGN, Q1416+2649{}, which shows [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ and CO(4$-$3) luminosities an order of magnitude fainter for its far-infrared luminosity than other QSOs in our sample, possibly due to a lower molecular gas mass.

  The Milky Way's disk-halo interface mediates energy and mass exchange between the interstellar thin disk and the halo. In the first detailed study of the Perseus arm's disk-halo interface, we combine HST/STIS and COS absorption spectra toward 6 stars and 23 AGNs projected behind a narrow section (95 degree &lt; l &lt;145 degree, -46 degree &lt; b &lt;0 degree), providing a unique dataset that bridges the disk and its extended vertical structure in these directions. We detect S II, Si IV, and C IV absorption, along with HI 21 cm emission, within -70 pc to -3.3 kpc from the mid-plane. The arm's southern vertical structure exhibits complexity beyond simple exponential scaling: HI and S II column densities sharply decline with height up to 1.5 kpc before flattening, while high ion (Si IV and C IV) column densities remain relatively constant. In this region, where warm neutral medium (WNM) dominates, S II and the high ions show similar kinematics, and we find a remarkably uniform CIV/SiIV ratio (&lt;C IV/Si IV&gt; = 2.5 pm 0.5) within -0.9 to -3.25 kpc. Both the kinematic correspondence and high-ion ratio are consistent with the high ions probing turbulent mixing layers at the interfaces between warm/cool and hot gas phases. AGN sightlines reveal minimal circumgalactic medium (CGM) contribution in the low-velocity gas at |v_{LSR}|&lt; 100 km/s, suggesting the observed properties may be attributed to previous fountain activity.   

Exploring the disc-jet scenario in 3C 273 using simultaneous XMM-Newton

  Context: 3C 273, a well-studied active galactic nucleus (AGN), displays characteristics of both jetted-AGN and Seyfert galaxies, making it an excellent source to study the disc-jet connection in AGN. Aims: To investigate the disk-jet scenario in 3C 273 using broadband (0.3--78 keV) X-ray spectra from {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR}. Methods: We used simultaneous {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR} observations of 3C 273 carried out between 2012 and 2024. The 0.3--78 keV X-ray spectra were first fit with a simple power-law (PL) and then with the accretion-ejection-based JeTCAF model. The JeTCAF model accounts for emission from the jet, extending up to the sonic surface. In this framework, a reflection hump above 10 keV can also arise due to the bulk motion Comptonization of coronal photons by the jet. Results: We found that the simple PL did not provide a good fit, leaving significant residuals at energies below 1.5 keV. All the spectra were fitted well by the JeTCAF model. The weighted-averaged black hole mass of (7.77$\pm$0.30) $\times 10^8 M_\odot$ obtained from the JeTCAF model is comparable with the previous estimates based on reverberation mapping observations and accretion disk models. Conclusions: The 0.3--78 keV X-ray emission of 3C 273 can be fit by the accretion-ejection-based model in which the corona and the jet on top of it make significant contributions to the X-ray flux. The Doppler boosting factor estimated from the jet flux ranges from 1.6 to 2.2, consistent with the lower limit from the literature.

  The filamentary nebula encompassing the central galaxy of the Perseus Cluster, NGC 1275, is a complex structure extending dozens of kiloparsecs from NGC 1275. Decades of previous works have focused on establishing the primary formation and ionization mechanisms in different filaments. These studies have pointed to a lack of star formation in the majority of the filaments, the importance of magnetic fields and turbulence in several regions, and the role of interactions between the intercluster medium (ICM) and the cool gas in the filaments, as well as the role of interaction between the central radio source, 3C84, and the filaments. In this paper, we present multi-filter observations of the entire filamentary system that cover the optical bandpass, using the SITELLE instrument at the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope. Here, we use the data analysis software, \href{https://crhea93.github.io/LUCI/index.html}{\texttt{LUCI}}, to produce flux maps of the prominent emission lines present in the filters: \oii{}$\lambda$3726/3729, \oiii{}$\lambda$5007, H$\beta$, \nii{}$\lambda$6548, \nii{}$\lambda$6583, and H$\alpha$. We use these maps to produce BPT and WHAN diagrams to study the ionization mechanisms at play in each distinct region of the filamentary nebula. First, we confirm the absence of \oiii{}$\lambda$5007 in the extended filaments, although we detect this line in the central core, revealing a compact region where photoionization by the AGN might affect local conditions. Our findings corroborate previous claims that the ionization in the extended filaments could be caused by the cooling ICM via collisional excitation and/or mixing. Moreover, they support the conclusion that magnetic fields play an important role in the formation and continued existence of the filaments.

  Galactic outflows driven by rapidly-accreting quasars at high redshift are widely expected to play a key role in the short- and long-term future evolution of their host galaxies. Using new and archival ALMA data, we observed the OH 119um doublet lines in order to search for cold molecular outflows in a sample of 11 unobscured, IR-luminous quasars at z&gt;6. This represents the first survey for molecular winds in reionization-era quasars, and we detect unambiguous outflows in 8/11 (73%) of the quasars. The outflows we find are substantially faster, by ~300km/s on average, than outflows observed in a roughly co-eval sample of non-quasar IR-luminous galaxies, suggesting that the AGN drive the winds to higher velocities. On the other hand, the implied molecular outflow rates are relatively modest given the high luminosities, suggesting typical mass loading factors ~0.5 in the cold gas. The outflows are consistent with expectations for momentum-driven winds regardless of the driving source, but the kinetic energy in the outflows suggests that the AGN must be at least partially responsible for driving the winds. Accordingly, we find trends between the outflow properties and the Eddington ratio of the black hole accretion, though this may be linked to the underlying trend with AGN luminosity. We find that the kinetic power carried in the cold outflow phase is typically only ~0.1% of the total AGN luminosity. Our study provides evidence in favor of AGN feedback on the cold molecular gas in $z&gt;6$ quasar host galaxies, demonstrating that cold outflows are very common and powerful in the most extreme reionization-era quasars.

  Synergies between the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} ({\em JWST}) and the {\em Chandra} X-ray observatory have advanced the observational frontier by detecting a handful of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) beyond $z \sim$ 10. In particular, the recent discovery of a candidate $\rm 8 \times 10^7~M_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) in the galaxy GHZ9 at $z =$ 10.4 favors massive seed formation channels for these objects. Motivated by prospects for their detection in radio by recent studies, we estimate radio fluxes for GHZ9 and explore the possibility of their detection with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). We find that ngVLA should be able to detect radio emission from GHZ9 for integration times as short as 1 hr while SKA will require integration times of up to 100 hr. We also find that radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that due to H II regions and supernovae in its host galaxy. The detection of a few hundred nJy radio signal at frequencies $&gt; 2$ GHz will be a smoking gun for the presence of a BH in GHZ9.

  We employ the SIMBA-C cosmological simulation to study the impact of its upgraded chemical enrichment model (Chem5) on the distribution of metals in the intragroup medium (IGrM). We investigate the projected X-ray emission-weighted abundance profiles of key elements over two decades in halo mass ($10^{13} \leq M_{500}/\mathrm{M_\odot} \leq 10^{15}$). Typically, SIMBA-C generates lower-amplitude abundance profiles than SIMBA with flatter cores, in better agreement with observations. For low-mass groups, both simulations over-enrich the IGrM with Si, S, Ca, and Fe compared to observations, a trend likely related to inadequate modeling of metal dispersal and mixing. We analyze the 3D mass-weighted abundance profiles, concluding that the lower SIMBA-C IGrM abundances are primarily a consequence of fewer metals in the IGrM, driven by reduced metal yields in Chem5, and the removal of the instantaneous recycling of metals approximation employed by SIMBA. Additionally, an increased IGrM mass in low-mass SIMBA-C groups is likely triggered by changes to the AGN and stellar feedback models. Our study suggests that a more realistic chemical enrichment model broadly improves agreement with observations, but physically motivated sub-grid models for other key processes, like AGN and stellar feedback and turbulent diffusion, are required to realistically reproduce observed group environments.
