  $ $The first public 0.9-4.4 $\mu$m NIRCam images of the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time Domain Field (TDF) uncovered many galaxies that display point-source features in their cores as seen in the longer wavelength filters. We visually identified a sample of 66 galaxies ($\sim$1 galaxy per arcmin$^2$) with point-like cores and fit their spectral energy distributions (SED)s using EAZY and CIGALE to characterize the sample's active galactic nucleus (AGN) and host galaxy parameters. Single-template fitting best fits $70\%$ of the sample with a Seyfert-blended SED. With CIGALE we compute the median fractional AGN contribution to the 0.1-30.0 $\mu$m flux to be $0.30\pm0.06$, and that $56\%$ of the 66 galaxies have star-formation rates in the starburst range whereas the remainder are near the star-formation main sequence. There are Very Large Array (VLA) 3 GHz detections for 24/66 galaxies, implying some combination of AGN emission and vigorous star formation. We present a novel sample selection procedure in tandem to the morphological sample selection based on objects' light profiles at 4.4 $\mu$m. This procedure identifies a parameter space which probes point-source features and automatically recovers our visual sample with minimal contamination from both stars and brighter galaxies. This procedure may be used in other extant and future NIRCam images to streamline the search for galaxies with point-like cores. The morphological approach to recognizing AGN is being resurrected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) by virtue of its superb angular resolution at infrared wavelengths.

  Recent discoveries of copious amounts of dust in quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 1-2$) challenge the conventional view that these objects have poor interstellar medium (ISM) in proportion to their stellar mass. We use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to explore the evolution of dust and cold gas content in QGs in relation to the quenching processes affecting them. We track the changes in the ISM dust abundance across the evolutionary history of QGs identified at $0 \lesssim z \lesssim2$ in the field and cluster environments. The QGs quench via diverse pathways, both rapid and slow, and exhibit a wide range of times elapsed between the quenching event and cold gas removal (from $\sim650$ Myr to $\sim8$ Gyr). We find that quenching modes attributed to the feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) do not affect dust and cold gas within the same timescales. Remarkably, QGs may replenish their dust content in the quenched phase primarily due to internal processes and marginally by external factors such as minor mergers. The key mechanism for re-formation of dust is prolonged grain growth on gas-phase metals, it is effective within $\sim100$ Myr after the quenching event, and rapidly increases the dust-to-gas mass ratio in QGs above the standard values ($\delta_{\rm DGR}\gtrsim1/100$). As a result, despite heavily depleted cold gas reservoirs, roughly half of QGs maintain little evolution in their ISM dust with stellar age within the first 2 Gyr following the quenching. Overall, we predict that relatively dusty QGs ($M_{\rm dust}/M_{\star}\gtrsim10^{-3}-10^{-4}$) arise from both fast and slow quenchers, and are prevalent in systems of intermediate and low stellar masses ($9&lt;\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&lt;10.5$). This prediction poses an immediate quest for observational synergy between e.g., James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).

  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit optical/UV variability and most of them can be well modeled by the damped random walks. Physical processes that are not related to the accretion disk, such as tidal disruption events (TDE) or moving foreground dusty clouds, can cause flare-like and eclipse-like features in the optical light curve. Both long-term and high-cadence monitoring are needed to identify such features. By combining the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Panoramic Survey Telescope, and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, we are able to identify a rare sample (11) out of the SDSS quasar catalog (around 83, 000). These quasars exhibit more or less constant brightness but show rapid optical variation in the ZTF DR2 epochs. To investigate the possible origins of these flare/eclipse-like variabilities, we propose the second epoch spectroscopic observations with the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC). We find that the change in accretion rate plays a significant role in these quasar variabilities. Among them, we identify two Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei (CL-AGN) candidates: SDSS J1427+2930 and SDSS J1420+3757. The luminosity change of the former may be caused by the enhanced SMBH accretion or the tidal disruption event, while the latter is more related to the change in the accretion rate.

  We report the finding of four changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGN). We selected these sources due to their potential as interesting targets when considering their relatively-large optical flux variations and related mid-infrared flux variations. To identify their CL feature, we use archival spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) taken at least 8 years ago as well as spectra taken recently from the Transient Name Server (TNS) and with the 2.4-m LiJiang telescope (LJT). We study the sources' spectral changes by fitting and determining the H$_\alpha$ and H$_\beta$ components and verify their CL behavior. When comparing the TNS and/or LJT spectra to the SDSS ones, all four sources showed the appearance of a broad or a stronger broad H$_\alpha$ component and a relatively weak broad H$_\beta$ component. As two of the four sources are established to have a brighter-and-bluer feature in the photometric data, during the time periods in which the TNS and LJT spectra were taken, this feature likely accompanied the turn-on of the broad components. Thus, we suggest that this brighter-and-bluer feature can be used as a criterion for efficiently finding CL sources among previously spectroscopically classified type 2 AGN, such as from among the sources provided by the SDSS.

  We present an analysis of the HST COS spectrum of IZw1 aiming to probe the absorbing medium associated with the active galactic nucleus (AGN). We fitted the emission spectrum and performed spectral analysis of the identified absorption features to derive the corresponding ionic column densities and covering fractions of the associated outflows. We employed photoionisation modelling to constrain the total column density and the ionisation parameter of four detected kinematic components. By investigating the implications of the results together with the observed kinematic properties of both emission and absorption features, we derived constraints on the structure and geometry of the absorbing medium in the AGN environment. We find and characterise absorption line systems from outflowing ionised gas in four distinct kinematic components, located at -60, -280, -1950, and -2900 km/s with respect to the source rest frame. While the two slower outflows are consistent with a full covering of the underlying radiation source, the well-constrained doublet line ratios of the faster two, higher column density, outflows suggest partial covering, with a covering fraction of C_f~0.4. The faster outflows show also line-locking in the NV doublet, a signature of acceleration via line absorption. This makes IZw1 possibly the closest object that shows evidence for hosting line-driven winds. The observed -1950 km/s absorption is likely due to the same gas as an X-ray warm absorber. Furthermore, the behaviour in UV and X-ray bands implies that this outflow has a clumpy structure. We find that the highly asymmetric broad emission lines in IZw1, indicative of a collimated, outflowing broad line region, are covered by the absorbing gas. Finally, the strongest UV--X-ray absorber may be connected to some of the blueshifted line emission, indicative of a more spatially extended structure of this ionised medium.   

Late-time X-ray Observations of the Jetted Tidal Disruption Event

  The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022cmc represents the fourth known example of a relativistic jet produced by the tidal disruption of a stray star providing a unique probe of the formation and evolution of relativistic jets in otherwise dormant supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Here we present deep, late-time Chandra observations of AT2022cmc extending to $t_{\rm obs} \approx 400$ days after disruption. Our observations reveal a sudden decrease in the X-ray brightness by a factor of $\gtrsim 14$ over a factor of $\approx 2.3$ in time, and a deviation from the earlier power-law decline with a steepening $\alpha \gtrsim 3.2$ ($F_X \propto t^{-\alpha}$), steeper than expected for a jet break, and pointing to the cessation of jet activity at $t_{\rm obs} \approx 215$ days. Such a transition has been observed in two previous TDEs (Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05). From the X-ray luminosity and the timescale of jet shutoff, we parameterize the mass of the SMBH in terms of unknown jet efficiency and accreted mass fraction parameters. Motivated by the disk-jet connection in AGN, we favor black hole masses $\lesssim 10^5 \ \rm M_{\odot}$ (where the jet and disk luminosities are comparable), and disfavor larger black holes (in which extremely powerful jets are required to outshine their accretion disks). We additionally estimate a total accreted mass of $\approx 0.1 \rm \ M_{\odot}$. Applying the same formalism to Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05, we favor comparable black hole masses for these TDEs of $\lesssim$ a few $\times 10^5 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, and suggest that jetted TDEs may preferentially form from lower mass black holes when compared to non-relativistic events, owing to generally lower jet and higher disk efficiencies at higher black hole masses.

  We report JWST/NIRSpec observations of a star-forming galaxy at $z=2.76$, MACSJ1149-WR1. We securely detect two temperature-sensitive auroral lines, [SIII]6312 (7.4$\sigma$) and [OII]7320+7331 doublets (10$\sigma$), and tentatively [NII]5755 ($2.3\sigma$) for the first time in an individual galaxy at $z&gt;1$. We perform a detailed analysis of its interstellar media (ISM), and derive electron temperatures, various heavy element abundances (O/H, N/O, S/O, and Ar/O) in the hot ionized region, and the neutral fraction in the warm ionized region. MACSJ1149-WR1 shows a broad feature at the wavelength of HeII 4686, which consists of a broad ($\sim1000$km/s), blue-shifted ($\sim-110$km/s) line component. Taken together with its mildly elevated N/O abundance, we conclude that MACSJ1149-WR1 is experiencing a young starburst ($&lt;10$Myr), likely hosting a large number of Wolf-Rayet stars. None of its spectral features support the presence of AGN, including: $(i)$ the absence of broad components and velocity shifts in Hydrogen recombination lines, $(ii)$ low [FeII]${\rm 1.257 \mu m}$/Pa$\beta$ ratio, and $(iii)$ the absence of high-ionization lines. Our analysis using HeI lines reveals a higher electron temperature and a higher attenuation value, indicating that HeI may probe a smaller spatial scale than HI, presumably the region dominated by the aforementioned Wolf-Rayet stars. The star formation rates derived from various HeI lines broadly agree with those from Hydrogen recombination lines. We thus advocate that HeI can be an excellent, independent probe of multi-phase ISM in the era of JWST.

  Aims: This study aims to trace the chronological evolution of galaxy spectra over cosmic time. Focusing on the VIPERS dataset, we seek to understand the diverse population of galaxies within narrow redshift bins, comparing our findings with the previously mapped diversity of SDSS galaxies.   Methods: We use Fisher-EM, an unsupervised subspace model-based classification algorithm to classify a dataset of 79,224 spectra from the VIPERS. The dataset was divided into 26 samples by bins of redshift ranging from 0.4 - 1.2, which were classified independently. Classes of subsequent bins were linked through the k-Nearest Neighbour method to create a chronological tree of classes at different epochs.   Results: Based on the optical spectra, three main chronological galaxy branches have emerged: (i) red passive, (ii) blue star-forming, and (iii) very blue, possibly associated with AGN activity. Each of the branches differentiates into sub-branches discriminating finer properties such as D4000 break, colour, star-formation rate, and stellar masses and/or disappear with cosmic time. Notably, these classes align remarkably well with the branches identified in a previous SDSS analysis, indicating a robust and consistent classification across datasets. The chronological "tree" constructed from VIPERS data provides valuable insights into the temporal evolution of these spectral classes.   Conclusions: The synergy between VIPERS and SDSS datasets enhances our understanding of the evolutionary pathways of galaxy spectra. The remarkable correspondence between independently derived branches in both datasets underscores the reliability of our unsupervised machine-learning approach. The three sub-trees show complex branching structures highlighting different physical and evolutionary behaviours. This study contributes to the broader comprehension of galaxy evolution.

  A spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) provides room for the elusive ultra-light scalar particles (ULSP) to be produced through a phenomenon called \textit{superradiance}. As a result of this phenomenon, a cloud of scalar particles forms around the black hole by draining the spin angular momentum of the SMBH. In this work, we present a study of the superradiant instability due to a scalar field in the vicinity of the central SMBH in an AGN. We begin by showing that the time-evolution of the gravitational coupling $\alpha$ in a realistic ambiance created by the accretion disk around the SMBH in AGN leads to interesting consequences such as the amplified growth of the scalar cloud, enhancement of the gravitational wave emission rate, and appearance of higher modes of superradiance within the age of the Universe ($\sim 10^{10}$ years). We then explore the consequence of superradiance on the characteristics of the AGN. Using the Novikov-Thorne model for an accretion disk, we divide the full spectrum into three distinct wavelength bands- X-ray ($10^{-4}-10^{-2}~\mu$m), UV (0.010-0.4~$\mu$m), and Vis-IR (0.4~$\mu$m-100~$\mu$m) and observe sudden drops in the time-variations of the luminosities across these bands and Eddington ratio ($f_{\textrm{Edd}}$) with a characteristic timescale of superradiance. Using a uniform distribution of spin and mass of the SMBHs in AGNs, we demonstrate the appearance of depleted regions and accumulations along the boundaries of these regions in the planes of different band-luminosities and $f_{\textrm{Edd}}$. Finally, we discuss some possible signatures of superradiance that can be drawn from the observed time-variation of the AGN luminosities.
