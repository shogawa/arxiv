  Semi-analytic models (SAMs) systematically predict higher stellar-mass scatter at a given halo mass than hydrodynamical simulations and most empirical models. Our goal is to investigate the physical origin of this scatter by exploring modifications to the physics in the SAM Dark Sage. We design two black hole formation models that approximate results from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 hydrodynamical simulation. In the first model, we assign a fixed black hole mass of $10^{6}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to every halo that reaches $10^{10.5}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In the second model, we disregard any black hole growth as implemented in the standard Dark Sage model. Instead, we force all black hole masses to follow the median black hole mass-halo mass relation in IllustrisTNG 300-1 with a fixed scatter. We find that each model on its own does not significantly reduce the scatter in stellar mass. To do this, we replace the native Dark Sage AGN feedback model with a simple model where we turn off cooling for galaxies with black hole masses above $10^{8}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. With this additional modification, the SMBH seeding and fixed conditional distribution models find a significant reduction in the scatter in stellar mass at halo masses between $10^{11-14}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. These results suggest that AGN feedback in SAMs acts in a qualitatively different way than feedback implemented in cosmological simulations. Either or both may require substantial modification to match the empirically inferred scatter in the Stellar Mass Halo Mass Relation (SMHMR).

  Spinning supermassive black holes (BHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) magnetically launch relativistic collimated outflows, or jets. Without angular momentum supply, such jets are thought to perish within $3$ orders of magnitude in distance from the BH, well before reaching kpc-scales. We study the survival of such jets at the largest scale separation to date, via 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of rapidly spinning BHs immersed into uniform zero-angular-momentum gas threaded by weak vertical magnetic field. We place the gas outside the BH sphere of influence, or the Bondi radius, chosen much larger than the BH gravitational radius, $R_\text{B}=10^3R_\text{g}$. The BH develops dynamically-important large-scale magnetic fields, forms a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD), and launches relativistic jets that propagate well outside $R_\text{B}$ and suppress BH accretion to $1.5\%$ of the Bondi rate, $\dot{M}_\text{B}$. Thus, low-angular-momentum accretion in the MAD state can form large-scale jets in Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type I and II galaxies. Subsequently, the disk shrinks and exits the MAD state: barely a disk (BAD), it rapidly precesses, whips the jets around, globally destroys them, and lets $5-10\%$ of $\dot{M}_\text{B}$ reach the BH. Thereafter, the disk starts rocking back and forth by angles $90-180^\circ$: the rocking accretion disk (RAD) launches weak intermittent jets that spread their energy over a large area and suppress BH accretion to $\lesssim 2 \% ~ \dot{M}_\text{B}$. Because BAD and RAD states tangle up the jets and destroy them well inside $R_\text{B}$, they are promising candidates for the more abundant, but less luminous, class of FR0 galaxies.

  In this work we analyse 3 average-luminosity hard X-ray selected AGN: ESO 506-G27, IGR J19039+3344 and NGC 7465. They have simultaneous Swift/XRT and NuSTAR data never published before and have been poorly studied at X-ray energies. These sources make for interesting targets both from a methodological and scientific point of view. Scientifically, they are of interest since they are possibly heavily absorbed objects, belong to a peculiar class and are variable both in flux and in spectral shape. Methodologically, because it is an interesting exercise to understand how existing spectral models can be applied to faint sources and how the use of NuSTAR data alone and then simultaneous and/or average data impacts on the spectral parameters determination. In this work we demonstrate that simultaneous data are not sufficient if their statistical quality is poor. Moreover, we show that also the use of time-averaged data when dealing with faint AGN does not always provide confident results as for brighter AGN. Regardless of the poor data quality employed in our analysis, we are able to provide insights into the spectral characteristics of each source. We analyse in detail for the first time the iron line complex of ESO 506-G27, finding not only the presence of the iron K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$ lines, but also of the iron K edge around 7 keV in the NuSTAR data. We also highlight changes in the absorption properties of IGR J19039+3344 and confirm NGC 7465 to be an unabsorbed type 1 LINER.

  Most Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe are obscured. In these obscured AGN an excess is usually observed in the soft X-rays below ~2 keV above the absorbed X-ray continuum. This spectral component is associated with the scattering of X-ray photons off free electrons in the Narrow Line Region (NLR), and/or to photoionised lines. Recent studies have found that in highly obscured AGN this component has lower flux relative to the primary X-ray continuum than in less obscured AGN. This is measured by the scattering fraction, or fscatt, which is the ratio of the scattered flux to the continuum. Here, we use the ray-tracing platform RefleX to perform simulations of scattered X-ray radiation to test two possible explanations for this phenomenon: (1) sources with lower fscatt are viewed at higher inclinations or (2) low fscatt sources are characterized by larger covering factors. We consider a conical NLR of free electrons, while allowing the column density and opening angle (and hence covering factor) to vary. We also consider electron densities inferred from observations, and from simulations carried out with the spectral synthesis code Cloudy. Our simulations show fscatt is expected to be related to both the inclination angle and covering factor of the torus; however, the observed negative correlation between fscatt and NH can only be explained by a positive relation between the column density and the covering factor of the obscuring material. Additional contributions to fscatt can come from unresolved photoionised lines and ionised outflowing gas.

  Despite powerful X-ray emission, some AGNs are known to either lack optical emission lines (so-called 'optically dull' AGNs) or have lines that fall on the star-forming branch of the BPT diagram ('misclassified' AGNs). Aperture effects have been proposed to explain such atypical spectra, especially when based on SDSS (3'') fibers. We use observations from VLT-MUSE with Adaptive Optics to explore the spatially resolved optical emission line properties of 4 optically dull and 1 misclassified X-ray AGN candidates. VLT-MUSE IFU spectra allow us to investigate the extent to which the aperture size affects the emission line measurements. The optically dull AGNs become detectable in deeper VLT-MUSE spectroscopic apertures having the same size (3'') as SDSS fibers, suggesting no AGN is truly lineless. However, in no case does the line become more detectable as the aperture decreases, as would be expected if dilution by strong continuum was responsible for making the lines appear weak. We also show that the misclassified X-ray AGN retains the same position on the BPT diagram in smaller apertures (down to 0.''5), demonstrating that its misclassification is not the result of the dilution by HII regions. Thus, we conclude that continuum swamping or star formation dilution, i.e., aperture effects, are not responsible for atypical lines. Rather, the AGN lines are intrinsically weak.

  We present a comprehensive study of the molecular gas properties of 17 Type 2 quasars at $z &lt;$ 0.2 from the Quasar Feedback Survey (L$_{[OIII]}$ &gt; $10^{42.1}$ $\rm ergs^{-1}$), selected by their high [OIII] luminosities and displaying a large diversity of radio jet properties, but dominated by LIRG-like galaxies. With these data, we are able to investigate the impact of AGN and AGN feedback mechanisms on the global molecular interstellar medium. Using APEX and ALMA ACA observations, we measure the total molecular gas content using the CO(1-0) emission and homogeneously sample the CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs), observing CO transitions (J$_{up}$ = 1, 2, 3, 6, 7). We observe high $r_{21}$ ratios (r$_{21}$ = L'$_{CO(2-1)}$/L'$_{CO(1-0)}$) with a median $r_{21}$ = 1.06, similar to local (U)LIRGs (with $r_{21}$ $\sim$ 1) and higher than normal star-forming galaxies (with r$_{21}$ $\sim$ 0.65). Despite the high $r_{21}$ values, for the 7 targets with the required data we find low excitation in CO(6-5) &amp; CO(7-6) ($r_{61}$ and $r_{62}$ &lt; 0.6 in all but one target), unlike high redshift quasars in the literature, which are far more luminous and show higher line ratios. The ionised gas traced by [OIII] exhibit systematically higher velocities than the molecular gas traced by CO. We conclude that any effects of quasar feedback (e.g. via outflows and radio jets) do not have a significant instantaneous impact on the global molecular gas content and excitation and we suggest that it only occurs on more localised scales.

  With the emergence of very high energy astronomy (VHE; E&gt;100 GeV), new open questions were presented to astronomers studying the multi-wavelength emission from blazars. Answers to these open questions, such as the Doppler crisis, and finding the location of the high-energy activity have eluded us thus far. Recently, quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength monitoring programs have shown considerable success in investigating blazar activity. After the launch of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008, such quasi-simultaneous observations across the electromagnetic spectrum became possible. In addition, with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations we can resolve the central parsec region of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and compare morphological changes to the gamma-ray activity to study high-energy emitting blazars. To achieve our goals, we need sensitive, long-term VLBI monitoring of a complete sample of VHE detected AGN. We performed VLBI observations of TeV-detected AGN and high likelihood neutrino associations as of December of 2021 with the Long Baseline Array (LBA) and other southern hemisphere radio telescopes at 2.3 GHz. In this paper we present first light TANAMI S-band images, focusing on the TeV-detected sub-sample of the full TANAMI sample. Apart from these very high energy-detected sources, we also show images of the two flux density calibrators and two additional sources included in the observations. We study the redshift, 0.1-100 GeV photon flux and S-band core brightness temperature distributions of the TeV-detected objects, and find that flat spectrum radio quasars and low synchrotron peaked sources on average show higher brightness temperatures than high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs. Sources with bright GeV gamma-ray emission also show higher brightness temperature values than gamma-low sources.

  In this paper, we present the discovery of a dual AGN in a $\sim$14:1 minor merger between the galaxy SDSS J125417.98+274004.6 and its unnamed dwarf satellite. We calculated stellar masses of the primary and secondary galaxy to be 3.8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_{\odot}$ and 2.7$\times$10$^{9}$M$_{\odot}$, respectively. We used archival Chandra X-ray observations to assess AGN presence. We found that both AGN have comparable luminosities of $\sim$2$\times$10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with the secondary AGN being more likely to be the dominant one. The galaxies are in the early stages of the merger and are connected by a tidal bridge. Computational works suggest that the secondary AGN should experience a brief but intensive period of Eddington-limit approaching accretion during the early stages of the merger. During the merger, the secondary black hole can increase its mass by a factor of ten. SDSS J125417.98+274004.6 is the first known dual AGN in an early-stage minor merger with a comparably or more luminous secondary AGN. As such, it will be of great value for future studies of merger-triggered accretion and black hole growth.

  We present continuum observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of 10 high-redshift ($2.2 \le z \le 2.7$) ultraluminous quasars (QSOs) and constrain the presence of hot, ionized, circum-galactic gas in a stacking analysis. We measure a Compton-y parameter profile with a peak value of $(1.7 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{-6}$ at a radius of $\sim50$ kpc. We compare our stacked observations to active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback wind models and generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) pressure profile models to constrain the wind luminosity and halo mass of the stacked QSOs. Our observations constrain the observed stack's halo mass to $&lt;1\times 10^{13}M_{\odot}$ and the stack's feedback wind power $&lt;1\times 10^{12}L_{\odot}$, which is $&lt;1$% of the bolometric luminosity of the quasar.

  We investigate the time-varying electromagnetic emission of a low-mass-ratio supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) embedded in a circumprimary disk, with a particular interest in variability of shocks driven by the binary. We perform a 2D, locally isothermal hydrodynamics simulation of a SMBHB with mass ratio $q=0.01$ and separation $a=100\;R_g$, using a physically self-consistent steady disk model. We estimate the electromagnetic variability from the system by monitoring accretion onto the secondary and using an artificial viscosity scheme to capture shocks and monitor the energy dissipated. The SMBHB produces a wide, eccentric gap in the disk, previously only observed for larger mass ratios, which we attribute to our disk model being much thinner ($H/R\approx0.01$ near the secondary) than is typical of previous works. The eccentric gap drives periodic accretion onto the secondary SMBH on a timescale matching the orbital period of the binary, $t_{\rm{bin}}\approx0.1\;\rm{yr}$, implying that the variable accretion regime of the SMBHB parameter space extends to lower mass ratios than previously established. Shocks driven by the binary are periodic, with a period matching the orbital period, and the shocks are correlated with the accretion rate, with peaks in the shock luminosity lagging peaks in the accretion rate by $0.43\;t_{\rm{bin}}$. We propose that the correlation of these quantities represents a useful identifier of SMBHB candidates, via observations of correlated variability in X-ray and UV monitoring of AGN, rather than single-waveband periodicity alone.
