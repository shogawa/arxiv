  Finding the first generation of stars formed out of pristine gas in the early Universe, known as Population III (PopIII) stars, is one of the most important goals of modern astrophysics. Recent models suggest that PopIII stars may form in pockets of pristine gas in the halo of more evolved galaxies. Here we present NIRSpec-IFU and NIRSpec-MSA observations of the region around GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at $z=10.6$, which reveal a $&gt;$5$\sigma$ detection of a feature consistent with being HeII$\lambda$1640 emission at the redshift of GN-z11. The very high equivalent width of the putative HeII emission in this clump (170 A), and the lack of metal lines, can be explained in terms of photoionisation by PopIII stars, while photoionisation by PopII stars is inconsistent with the data. It would also indicate that the putative PopIII stars likely have a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), with an upper cutoff reaching at least 500 M$_\odot$. The PopIII bolometric luminosity inferred from the HeII line would be $\sim 2\times 10^{10}~L_\odot$, which (with a top-heavy IMF) would imply a total stellar mass formed in the burst of $\sim 6\times 10^{5}~M_\odot$. We find that photoionisation by the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in GN-z11 cannot account for the HeII luminosity observed in the clump, but can potentially be responsible for additional HeII emission observed closer to GN-z11. We also consider the possibility of in-situ photoionisation by an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH) hosted by the HeII clump; we find that this scenario is less favoured, but it remains a possible alternative interpretation. We also report the detection of a Ly$\alpha$ halo stemming out of GN-z11 and extending out to $\sim$2 kpc, as well as resolved, funnel-shaped CIII] emission, likely tracing the ionisation cone of the AGN.

  Radio galaxies are a subclass of active galactic nuclei in which accretion onto the supermassive black hole releases energy via relativistic jets. The jets are not constantly active throughout the life of the host galaxy and alternate between active and quiescent phases. Remnant radio galaxies are detected during a quiescent phase and define a class of unique sources to constrain the AGN duty cycle. We present, a spatially resolved radio analysis of the radio galaxy associated with NGC 6086 and constraints on the spectral age of the diffuse emission to investigate the duty cycle and evolution of the source. We use three new low-frequency, high-sensitivity observations, performed with the Low Frequency Array at 144 MHz and with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 400 MHz and 675 MHz. To these, we add two Very Large Array archival observations at 1400 and 4700 MHz. In the new observations, we detect a second pair of larger lobes and three regions with a filamentary morphology. We analyse the spectral index trend in the inner remnant lobes and see systematic steeper values at the lower frequencies compared to the GHz ones. Steeper spectral indices are found in the newly detected outer lobes (up to 2.1), as expected if they trace a previous phase of activity of the AGN. However, the differences between the spectra suggest different dynamical evolution within the intragroup medium during their expansion and/or different magnetic field values. We place constraints on the age of the inner and outer lobes and derive the duty cycle of the source. This results in a total active time of $\sim$39%. The filamentary structures have a steep spectral index ($\sim$1) without any spectral index trend and only one of them shows a steepening in the spectrum. Their origin is not yet clear, but they may have formed due to the compression of the plasma or due to magnetic field substructures.

  As one of the drivers of feedback in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the jets launched from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are important for understanding the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. However, the formation of AGN jets is far from clear. The discovery of gamma-ray narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies during the past two decades has provided us with a new means of studying the link between jets and accretion processes and the formation of jets. Here, we explore the coupling of jet and accretion discs in seven bright gamma-ray NLS1 galaxies by studying simultaneous optical/ultraviolet and X-ray observations of these systems taken by Swift. The results show that, except for 1H 0323+342 in which the X-rays are significantly contributed from the accretion disc, the observed X-ray emission of the other sources is dominated by the jet, and accretion process makes little contribution if not absent. Although the origin of the X-ray emission is different, the broad-band spectral shape characterized by alpha_ox and the X-ray flux is found to follow the same evolutionary trend in 1H 0323+342, PMN J0948+0022, and PKS 1502+036. For the remaining sources, the trend is not observed or the sampling is not dense enough.
