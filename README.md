  The nuclear regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) likely host clumpy clouds that occasionally obscure the central X-ray source, causing eclipse events. These events offer a unique opportunity to study the properties and origins of such clouds. However, these transient events are rarely reported due to the need for extensive, long-term X-ray monitoring for years. Here, we conduct a systematic search for eclipse events in 40 AGNs well-monitored by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) over the past 20 years, comprising a total of $\sim$11,000 observations. Our selection criteria rely on significant variations in X-ray flux and spectral shape. We identify 3 high-confidence events in 3 AGNs and 8 candidates in 6 AGNs, all in type I AGNs. The observed clouds have column densities of $N_{\rm H}~\sim$ (0.2 $-$ 31.2) $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization degrees of log $\xi$ $\sim$ (-1.3 $-$ 2.2). For the 5 events with well-constrained duration, their distances from the central black hole range from (2.4 $-$ 179) $\times$ 10$^{4}$ $R_{\rm g}$, with 2 clouds near the dust sublimation zone, 2 farther out. Interestingly, we find tentative correlations between the cloud properties (i.e. ionization state and column density) and the black hole mass and mass accretion rate, implying their strong connection to the accretion process, potentially via outflows. Our study also demonstrates the potential of the new X-ray all-sky monitor, Einstein Probe, in providing more detection and physical constraints for such events.

  Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are a distinct category of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) whose optical variability characteristics have not been well investigated. We present here the results of our investigation on the optical flux and colour variability properties of a bona fide sample of 38 CSOs. We used the g-, r- and i-bands data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey that spans a duration of about 5 years. We also considered a comparison sub-sample of blazars that includes 5 flat spectrum radio quasars and 12 BL Lac objects with redshifts and g-band magnitudes similar to the limited sub-sample of 9 CSOs. These two sub-samples of AGN, chosen for this comparative study of their long-term optical variability, represent different orientations of their relativistic jets with respect to the observer. We found that both CSOs and blazars exhibit optical flux variations, although variability of CSOs is lower than that of blazars. The observed variability in both CSOs and blazars is attributed to the relativistic jets and the increased optical variations in blazars relative to CSOs are likely due to beaming effects. CSOs and blazars exhibit similar colour variations, with both of them showing a bluer when brighter trend. Such a colour variability pattern is expected due to processes associated with their relativistic jets.

  We present a catalog of quasar pairs (QPs) constructed from the DESI DR1 quasar sample, which includes approximately 1.6 million spectroscopically confirmed quasars. Using a redshift-dependent self-matching procedure and applying physical constraints on projected separation (up to 110 kpc) and line-of-sight velocity difference (up to 2000 km/s), we identified 1,842 candidate quasar pairs. Each pair is spectroscopically confirmed, providing reliable redshift and velocity information. We visually classified these systems using DESI Legacy Imaging and SPARCL spectral data into four categories: QP (quasar pairs), QPC (quasar pair candidates), LQC (lensed quasar candidates), and Uncertain. The redshift distribution peaks at around z = 1 to 2.5, and 64.3 percent of QPs have line-of-sight velocity differences below 600 km/s, suggesting that many systems may be physically associated. This catalog provides a statistically meaningful sample for future studies of dual AGNs, gravitational lensing, and quasar clustering.

  We present the morphological properties of 17 spectroscopically confirmed massive quiescent galaxies ($10.2 &lt; \log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 11.2$) at $3.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.3$, observed with JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam. Using S\'{e}rsic profile fits to the F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size-mass relation and find typical sizes of $\sim$0.6-0.8 kpc at $M_{\ast} = 5 \times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$, consistent with a factor of $\sim$7 growth from $z \sim 4$ to the present day, including a factor of $\sim$2 by $z \sim 2$. Galaxies with earlier formation times ($z_{50} \gtrsim 5$) tend to be larger (up to 0.3 dex above the relation), while late-forming galaxies are more compact. Using a random forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by $\log(1+\delta^{\prime}_{3})$ from the distances to the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$), which ranges from 0.25 to 1. Applying the same method to the IllustrisTNG simulation, the ex-situ stellar mass fraction ($f_{\ast,\mathrm{ex\text{-}situ}}$) -- a proxy for mergers -- is the dominant predictor of $B/T$. Galaxies with high $B/T$ in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales ($\lesssim0.4$ Gyr), consistent with bulge growth via merger-induced starbursts; in simulations, such galaxies exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions ($\sim20\%$-$30\%$). In contrast, some high-$B/T$ galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that additional mechanisms -- such as violent disk instabilities -- may contribute. These findings point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.   

Evidence of a fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events coming from active

  The formation channels of the gravitational-wave (GW) sources detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) remain poorly constrained. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed as one of the potential hosts but the fraction of GW events originating from AGNs has not been quantified. Here, we constrain the AGN-origin fraction $f_{\rm agn}$ by analyzing the spatial correlation between GW source localizations ($O1\!-\!O4$a) and AGN distributions (SDSS DR16). We find evidence of an excess of low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \le 10^{45}~\!\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) as well as low-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \le 0.05$) AGNs around the LVK events, the explanation of which requires $f_{\rm agn} = 0.39^{+0.41}_{-0.32}$ and $0.29^{+0.40}_{-0.25}$ (90\% confidence level) of the LVK events originating from these respective AGN populations. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this correlation is unlikely to arise from random coincidence, further supported by anomalous variation of the error of $f_{\rm agn}$ with GW event counts. These results provide the first observational evidence for GW sources coming from either low-luminosity or low-accretion-rate AGNs, offering critical insights into the environmental dependencies of the formation of GW sources.

  The correlations between Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies still defy our understanding from both the observational and theoretical perspectives. Here we perform pairwise residual analysis on the latest sample of local inactive galaxies with a uniform calibration of their photometric properties and with dynamically measured masses of their central SMBHs. The residuals reveal that stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and, possibly host dark matter halo mass $M_{\rm halo}$, appear as the galactic properties most correlated with SMBH mass, with a secondary (weaker) correlation with spheroidal (bulge) mass $M_{\rm sph}$, as also corroborated by additional Machine Learning tests. These findings may favour energetic/kinetic feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as the main driver in shaping SMBH scaling relations. Two state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, inclusive of kinetic AGN feedback, are able to broadly capture the mean trends observed in the residuals, although they tend to either favour $M_{\rm sph}$ as the most fundamental property, or generate too flat residuals. Increasing AGN feedback kinetic output does not improve the comparison with the data. In the Appendix we also show that the galaxies with dynamically measured SMBHs are biased high in $\sigma$ at fixed luminosity with respect to the full sample of local galaxies, proving that this bias is not a byproduct of stellar mass discrepancies. Overall, our results suggest that probing the SMBH-galaxy scaling relations in terms of total stellar mass alone may induce biases, and that either current data sets are incomplete, and/or that more insightful modelling is required to fully reproduce observations.   

Abundant Population of Broad H$α$ Emitters in the GOODS-N Field
  Revealed by CONGRESS, FRESCO, and JADES

  We present a spectroscopic search for broad H$\alpha$ emitters at z~3.7-6.5 in the GOODS-N field, utilizing JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging. We identify 19 broad H$\alpha$ emitters with FWHM &gt; 1000 km/s at z~4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The black hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad H$\alpha$ components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher $M_{BH}/M_{*}$ ratios relative to the local $M_{BH}$-$M_{*}$ relations, consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep red slope. A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of color-selected LRDs with H$\alpha$ detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.

  We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity AGNs at $z=3.9-6$ in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with either broad H$\alpha$ emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, $\delta$, averaged over (15 $h^{-1}$cMpc)$^3$, ranges from $-0.56$ to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that $&gt; 10$ cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 $h^{-1}$cMpc, and 7.66 $h^{-1}$cMpc at $3.9 &lt; z &lt; 5$ and $5 &lt; z &lt; 6$, respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of $\log (M_h/M_\odot)\approx 11.0-11.2$ and host stellar masses of $\log (M_\star/M_\odot) \approx 8.4-8.6$ by comparing with the UniverseMachine simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could be a common phase in galaxy evolution.
