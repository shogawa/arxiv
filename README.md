AGN variability offers a direct probe of accretion physics, disk structure, and black hole growth, but progress has been limited by sample size, cadence heterogeneity, and photometric systematics. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will deliver multi-band light curves for millions of AGN, enabling variability studies at a true population scale. We synthesize recent results from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which demonstrate that optical variability amplitudes and timescales are primarily regulated by accretion state, with secondary dependence on black hole mass and redshift, and establish the feasibility of survey-driven continuum reverberation mapping. ZTF measurements reveal optical continuum-emitting region sizes that often exceed standard thin disk predictions, implicating diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region as a significant contributor to observed inter-band lags. We evaluate the implications of LSST cadence and survey strategy, particularly the deep drilling fields, for continuum and emission line reverberation mapping, changing-look AGN, extreme variability quasars, and periodic variability searches. Key limitations of broadband photometric variability are identified, including variable emission line contamination, diffuse BLR continuum emission, and cadence-dependent lag recoverability. We argue that realizing LSST's full scientific potential requires community-scale, standardized variability metric pipelines, probabilistic classification integrated with alert brokers for follow-up triggering, and complementary medium-band photometric observations to isolate the accretion disk continuum. Together, these elements will enable LSST to convert photometric variability into quantitative constraints on accretion disks, BLR structure, and supermassive black hole growth across cosmic time.

This work investigates the origin of the TeV emission detected by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) from NGC 4278, a galaxy hosting a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN). Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $γ$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC~1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n_{\rm L,0}(ΔT_{\rm TeV}/T) \sim 10^{-5}~\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection.

The origin of the radio emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still debated. Multiple physical mechanisms can contribute to the spectrum at these frequencies, including relativistic jets, the jet base, outflows, star formation, and synchrotron emission from the hot corona. Recently, new extreme radio variability has been observed in the class of low-mass/high-Eddington AGN known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, suggesting that another, more exotic mechanism may also play a role, especially at frequencies above 10 GHz. To investigate this relatively unexplored area of the radio spectrum, we observed a sample of 50 NLS1s with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and 20 of them were observed twice. In this sample, 24 sources were not detected, while the others are typically characterized by a steep spectrum that can be modeled with a power law. We also identified two new candidate jetted NLS1s, including a high-frequency peaker, which is an extremely young relativistic jet. We found no significant variability in the sources observed twice. We conclude that the radio spectrum of NLS1s is typically dominated by optically thin emission, likely from low-power outflows, or by circumnuclear star formation, with a limited contribution from relativistic jets. Further studies at different spatial scales and at other wavelengths are necessary to fully constrain the origin of the radio emission in this class of active galaxies.

We report the results of a pilot study that searched for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in local ($z&lt;$0.25) galaxies hosting double-peaked narrow emission lines in their optical spectra. We present high-resolution $L-$band (1.5 GHz or 18 cm) continuum images from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) as well as WFC3/IR F160W images from the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} of two candidate dual AGN systems: J0948+6848 and J1223+5409. In both targets, we detected compact non-thermal radio emission that is approximately co-spatial with the near-infrared AGN. Both systems host two high brightness temperature ($&gt;10^{8}$ K) radio sources that indicate the presence of either a parsec-scale-separation dual AGN ($d_{\text{sep}} \sim 90$ pc and $\sim 56$ pc, respectively) or a radio jet. Matched-resolution multi-band radio observations are necessary to further characterize the AGN activity in these systems.

Here we present the results of our search through the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) - a rare classification of galaxies displaying strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines within their spectra. With the requirement of a strong X-ray continuum to generate the coronal emission, ECLEs have been linked to both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We focus our search on identifying TDE-linked ECLEs. We identify three such objects within the EDR sample, highlighting DESI's effectiveness for discovering new nuclear transients, and determine a galaxy-normalized TDE-linked ECLE rate of $R_\mathrm{G}=5~^{+5}_{-3}\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at a median redshift of z = 0.2 - broadly consistent with previous works. Additionally, we also identify more than 200 AGNs displaying coronal emission lines, which serve as the primary astrophysical contaminants in searches for TDE-related events. We also include an outline of the custom python code developed for this search.

We present an analysis of 22,656 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 ($0.1\leq z\leq 0.9$), identifying a sample of spectroscopically anomalous sources. These anomalies were detected via the spectroscopic quasar anomaly detection (SQuAD) algorithm, which employed principal component analysis and hierarchical k-means clustering. Various physical diagnostic analysis were performed such as the color excess ($E_{(B-V)}$) calculations, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) color analysis, probing O III, equivalent width as an inclination indicator, the BPT diagram and eigenvector 1 diagram. We detected 620 anomalous NLSy1s classified into two groups i.e. 246, Red NLSy1s, exhibiting host galaxy dominated spectra with a low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) core revealed by the emission line widths. Another set of 374 Blue NLSy1s, strongly luminous galaxies with enhanced AGN activity, bluer continuum as compared to a typical NLSy1 and stronger Fe II emission. Finally, the third group of 257 outliers, identified as Intermediate Seyferts, a class of Seyfert galaxies identified by composite emission profiles, and extremely strong emission lines paired with virtually no continuum. These sources also exhibit rare and high ionization emission lines unseen in any other NLSy1 spectra (e.g. [Ne V]$\lambda3345$, Ne V $\lambda3426$, Ne III $\lambda3869$ etc). We conclude that the differentiating factor between red and blue NLSy1s is not dust obscuration or orientation effect, but intrinsic distinction in AGN activity. The resulting sample is presented as a value-added catalog.

A significant fraction of galaxy clusters show central cooling times of less than 1 Gyr and associated central cluster entropies below $30\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$. We provide a straight forward explanation for these low central entropies in cool core systems and how this is related to accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Assuming a time-averaged equilibrium between active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet heating of the radiatively cooling intracluster medium (ICM) as well as Bondi accretion, we derive an equilibrium entropy that scales with the SMBH and cluster mass as $K\propto M_\bullet^{4/3}M_{500\mathrm{c}}^{-1}$. At fixed cluster mass, overly massive SMBHs would raise the central entropy above the cool core threshold, thus implying a novel way of limiting SMBH masses in cool core clusters. We find a limiting mass of $1.4\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in a cool core cluster of mass $10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We carry out three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster with AGN jets and find that they reproduce the predictions of our analytic model, once corrections for elevated jet entropies are applied in calculating X-ray emissivity-weighted cluster entropies. Our findings have significant implications for modelling galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations: a combination of overmassive SMBHs and high heating efficiencies preclude the formation of cool core clusters.

The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be ``black hole stars" (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $&gt;2\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\log(L_{\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β&gt;10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\sim20\%$ of the UV emission, $\sim50\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\sim90\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$α$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm{\star}}$~$10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\rm{\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008Å~$1100$Å, CIII]~$12$Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\gtrsim60\%$ at 5500Å) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\sim1\%$, lifetime $\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*.
