  We present second observations by K2 of OJ~287 and 7 other $\gamma$-ray AGNs obtained in 2017-2018, second and third observations of the lobe-dominated, steep spectrum quasar 3C~207, and observations of 9 additional blazars not previously observed with K2. The AGN were observed simultaneously with K2 and the Fermi Large Area Telescope for 51-81 days. Our full sample, observed in 2014-2018, contained 16 BL Lac objects (BL Lacs), 9 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), and 4 other $\gamma$-ray AGNs. Twelve BL Lacs and 7 FSRQs exhibited fast, jagged light curves while 4 BL Lacs and 2 FSRQs had slow, smooth light curves. Some objects changed their red-noise character significantly between repeated K2 observations. The optical characteristics of OJ~287 derived from the short-cadence K2 light curves changed between observations made before and after the predicted passage of the suspected secondary supermassive black hole through the accretion disk of the primary supermassive black hole. The average slopes of the periodogram power spectral densities of the BL Lacs' and FSRQs' light curves differed significantly, by $\approx 12$\%, with the BL Lac slopes being steeper, and a KS test with a $p$-value of 0.039 indicates that these samples probably come from different populations; however, this result is not as strongly supported by PSRESP analyses. Differences in the origin of the jets from the ergosphere or accretion disk in these two classes could produce such a disparity, as could different sizes or locations of emission regions within the jets.
