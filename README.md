  Recent studies on dwarf galaxies reveal that some of them harbor a massive black hole (BH), which is believed to have a similar mass of the Supermassive BH "seeds" at early times. The origin and growth of the primitive BHs are still open questions, since these BH seeds are hardly observed at high redshifts. Therefore, massive BH of dwarf galaxies can be the perfect candidates to untangle BH "seeds" properties and their influence on their host galaxy evolution, since massive BH may preserve their initial conditions due to its quiet merger and accretion histories. We use optical integral field unit observations, obtained with the Gemini GMOS-IFU, to study the gas emission and kinematics in four dwarf galaxies, candidates to host massive BH, based on the analysis of their [Fe X] luminosities measured from SDSS spectra. The [Fe X] emission line is not detected in our GMOS in any of the galaxies, prompting speculation that its absence in our recent data may stem from a past tidal disruption event coinciding with the observation period of the SDSS data. All galaxies exhibit extended gas emissions, and the spatially resolved emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams present values that suggest AGN photoionization from the [S II] - BPT diagram. The gas velocity fields of all galaxies are indicative of disturbed rotation patterns, with no detection of gas outflows in any of the sources. Although the [S II] - BPT diagrams indicate AGN photoionization, further confirmation through multi-wavelength observations is required to validate this scenario.

  The impact of winds and jet-inflated bubbles driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to significantly affect the host galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM) and regulate star formation. To explore this scenario, we perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to model the interaction between turbulent star-forming clouds and highly pressurised AGN-driven outflows, focusing on the effects of self-gravity. Our results demonstrate that the cloudlets fragmented by the wind can become gravitationally bound, significantly increasing their survival time. While external pressurisation leads to a global collapse of the clouds in cases of weaker winds ($10^{42}-10^{43}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$), higher-power winds ($10^{44}-10^{45}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$) disperse the gas and cause localised collapse of the cloudlets. We also demonstrate that a kinetic energy-dominated wind is more efficient in accelerating and dispersing the gas than a thermal wind with the same power. The interaction can give rise to multi-phase outflows with velocities ranging from a few 100 to several 1000~${\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. The mass outflow rates are tightly correlated with the wind power, which we explain by an ablation-based mass-loss model. Moreover, the velocity dispersion and the virial parameter of the cloud material can increase by up to one order of magnitude through the effect of the wind. Even though the wind can suppress or quench star formation for about 1 Myr during the initial interaction, a substantial number of gravitationally bound dense cloudlets manage to shield themselves from the wind's influence and subsequently undergo rapid gravitational collapse, leading to an enhanced star formation rate (SFR).

  Strong AGN heating provides an alternative means for the disruption of cluster cool cores (CCs) to cluster mergers. In this work we present a systematic Chandra study of a sample of 108 nearby ($z&lt;0.1$) galaxy clusters, to investigate the effect of AGN heating on CCs. About 40% of clusters with small offsets between the BCG and the X-ray centre ($\le50$ kpc) have small CCs. For comparison, 14 of 17 clusters with large offsets have small CCs, which suggests that mergers or sloshing can be efficient in reducing the CC size. Relaxed, small CC clusters generally have weak radio AGNs ($P_{1.4\rm GHz}&lt;10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$), and they show a lack of systems hosting a radio AGN with intermediate radio power ($2\times10^{23}&lt;P_{1.4\rm GHz}&lt;2\times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). We found that the strongest circumnuclear ($&lt;1$ kpc) X-ray emission only exists in clusters with strong radio AGN. The duty cycle of relaxed, small CC clusters is less than half of that for large CC clusters. It suggests that the radio activity of BCGs is affected by the properties of the surrounding gas beyond the central $\sim10$ kpc, and strong radio AGNs in small X-ray CCs fade more rapidly than those embedded in large X-ray CCs. A scenario is also presented for the transition of large CCs and coronae due to radio AGN feedback. We also present a detailed analysis of galaxy cluster 3C 129.1 as an example of a CC remnant possibly disrupted by radio AGN.

  JWST observations have the potential to provide unprecedented constraints on the history of reionization and the sources responsible for the ionizing photons due to the detection of large populations of faint galaxies at $z\gg6$. Modelling reionization requires knowing both the number of ionizing photons that are produced by galaxies and the fraction of those photons that escape into the intergalactic medium. Observational estimates of these values generally rely on spectroscopy for which large samples with well-defined selection functions remain limited. To overcome this challenge, we present an implicit likelihood inference (ILI) pipeline trained on mock photometry to predict the escaped ionizing luminosity of individual galaxies ($\dot{n}_{\rm ion}$) based on photometric magnitudes and redshifts. Compared to traditional SED-fitting methods, the new ILI pipeline is consistently more accurate and significantly faster. We deploy the method on a sample of 4,559 high-redshift galaxies from the JADES Deep survey, finding a gentle redshift evolution of $\log_{10}(\dot{n}_{\rm ion}) = (0.08\pm0.01)z + (51.60\pm0.06)$, with late-time values for $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$ consistent with theoretical models and observations. We measure the evolution of the volume-averaged ionized fraction and optical depth to find that observed populations of star-forming galaxies are capable of driving reionization to completion at $z\sim 5.3$ without the need for AGN or other exotic sources. The $20\%$ of UV-brightest galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-18.5$) in our sample can reionize only $\sim30\%$ of the survey volume, demonstrating that faint LyC emitters are crucial for reionization.
