  Recent high resolution mapping of the circum-nuclear regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has revealed the existence of geometrically thin nuclear disks, in general randomly oriented with respect to their galaxy hosts. These molecular tori have typical radii of 10~pc, and contain a few 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ of H$_2$, with H$_2$ column densities between 10$^{23}$ and 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. We mapped two of the most massive of these molecular tori with higher resolution, in order to unveil their morphology and kinematics, their possible warp and clumpiness, and derive their stability and life-time. We used the highest resolution possible with ALMA (16~km baseline) in Band 7, taking into account for mapping CO(3-2) and HCO$^+$(4-3) the compromise between sensitivity and resolution.   New features are discovered at the high resolution, obtained with a beam of 0.015\arcsec, equivalent to $\sim$ 1~pc scale, at their $\sim$ 15~Mpc distance. The molecular torus in NGC~613 appears like a ring, depleted in molecular gas near the center. The depletion region is displaced by 3~pc towards the NW from the AGN position, meaning some $m=1$ asymmetry in the torus.   The molecular torus in NGC~1672 has now a different position angle from previous observations, and is edge-on, revealing a geometrically very thin torus, with a clear warp. This confirms that the classical model of a simple geometrically thick dusty torus is challenged by high resolution observations. The nuclear disks appear clumpy, and slightly lopsided. The molecular outflow in NGC~613 is now resolved out. Well inside the sphere of influence of the black holes (BH), we are now able to determine more accurately their mass, for those Seyfert spiral galaxies, in a region of the M-sigma relation where the scatter is maximum.

  To improve our knowledge of nuclear emission in luminous QSOs at Cosmic Noon, we studied the X-ray emission of the WISE/SDSS-selected hyper-luminous (WISSH) QSO sample: 85 broad-line AGN with $L_{bol}&gt;few\times 10^{47}\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at $z\sim 2-4$. Our aim is to characterise their X-ray spectra and explore relations between X-ray luminosity and other bands, comparing powerful QSOs with the general AGN population. We performed spectral analysis for about half of the sample; 16 sources were analysed via their hardness ratio; for the others we estimated their intrinsic luminosity $L_{2-10\,keV}$. Only 8 sources are undetected. We report a large dispersion in $L_{2-10\,keV}$ despite the narrow distribution of $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\,\r{A}}$ and $\lambda L_{6\,\mu m}$ (about one-third of the sources classified as X-ray weak). This suggests differences in X-ray corona and accretion flow physics between hyper-luminous and less powerful AGN. X-ray photon index distribution is consistent with that of lower-$z$, lower-$L_{bol}$ AGN, and does not depend on the Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$) or X-ray weakness. Most WISSH QSOs with intrinsic absorption estimates show little to no obscuration ($N_H \le 5\times 10^{22}\,cm^{-2}$). Among the obscured sources we find blue QSOs without broad absorption lines within the "forbidden region" of the $Log(N_H)-Log(\lambda_{Edd})$ plane, typically occupied by dust-reddened QSOs and associated with intense feedback. We confirm a correlation between $L_{2-10\,keV}$ and CIV line blueshift, a tracer of nuclear ionized outflows. Multi-wavelength data and complete X-ray coverage enabled the investigation of the disk-corona interplay at the highest luminosity regimes. The broad distribution of bolometric correction and X-ray - to - optical index suggest caution when using $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\,\r{A}}$ or $L_{6\,\mu m}$ as direct X-ray proxy for individual luminous QSOs.
