  The Unification Model of AGN suggests that all AGN galaxies should exhibit similar line ratios in their spectra. NGC 5548, a Seyfert I, underwent obscuration -- similar to naturally obscured Seyfert II galaxies -- due to an outflowing accretion wind, resulting in absorption. As per the Model, a Seyfert I and a Seyfert II should show similar flux ratios during their respective obscuration states. In this note, we present a comparison of emission fluxes between NGC 5548 and NGC 1068, a Seyfert II. We present the CLOUDY prediction of NGC 5548, which underpredicts the line ratios compared to observations, likely due to SED choices. The differing observed line ratios of NGC 5548 and NGC 1068 suggest additional unknown factors in the unification model.

  We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning $0 &lt; z &lt; 7.5$, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon ($z \sim 1$-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with \texttt{GELATO} for emission-line galaxies and \texttt{pPXF} fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.

  A damped random walk (DRW) process is often used to describe the temporal UV/optical continuum variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, recent investigations have shown that this model fails to capture the full spectrum of AGN variability. In this work, we model the 22-year-long light curves of $21,767$ quasars, spanning the redshift range $0.28 &lt; z &lt; 2.71$, as a noise-driven damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) process. The light curves, in the optical $g$ and $r$ bands, are collected and combined from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, and the Zwicky Transient Facility. A DHO process can be defined using four parameters, two for describing its long-term behavior/variability, and the other two for describing its short-term behavior/variability. We find that the best-fit DHO model describes the observed variability of our quasar light curves better than the best-fit DRW model. Furthermore, the best-fit DHO parameters exhibit correlations with the rest-frame wavelength, the Eddington ratio, and the black hole mass of our quasars. Based on the power spectral density shape of the best-fit DHOs and these correlations, we suggest that the observed long-term variability of our quasars can be best explained by accretion rate or thermal fluctuations originating from the accretion disk, and the observed short-term variability can be best explained by reprocessing of X-ray variability originating from the corona. The additional information revealed by DHO modeling emphasizes the need to go beyond DRW when analyzing AGN light curves delivered by next-generation wide-field time-domain surveys.

  We present a study of quasar host galaxy 3C 297 which is home to a powerful bent-jet radio source suggesting vigorous interaction with a dense ISM and/or jet precession. Archival HST imaging showed interestingly perturbed morphology of the host with a bright ~30 kpc arc feature, extended filamentary structure of line-emitting gas and clumpy blue excess emission co-spatial with the radio hotspots. Our VLT/SINFONI integral-field observations reveal complex, spatially-resolved H{\alpha}+[NII] emission in this source. A prominent blue-shifted wing in H{\alpha} indicates an ionized gas flow extending out to ~18 kpc from the nuclear region. Combining our SINFONI narrow-H{\alpha} data with archival HST/UV and VLA imaging, we map the young stellar population in the host and compare the spatial distribution of star-forming regions with the ionized gas motion and jet structure. In the attempt to characterize the feedback mechanisms in this chaotic system, we suggest that the powerful radio source dominates the feedback with possible contribution from radiation pressure due to AGN accretion. We also propose that the expanding jet cocoon likely shocked the ISM, triggering a kpc-scale ionized gas outflow and new starbursts that enhanced ongoing merger-induced star formation.   

Serendipitous discovery of a young cluster of galaxies at $z \sim 0.5$

  Using a 90 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation in the 0.3--7 keV band, along with complementary Low-Frequency Array and Karl G.~Jansky Very Large Array data in the 120--168 MHz and 1--2 GHz ranges, we study the diffuse emission around the nearby dwarf galaxy KUG~1138+327. Our analysis reveals a diffuse X-ray feature on the southern side, disconnected from the galactic disk. This feature exhibits a hard X-ray spectrum, which is highly unusual for an outflow from a dwarf galaxy. We interpret the irregularly shaped feature as hot plasma in a young galaxy cluster at redshift 0.5, supported by X-ray spectral fitting and consistent with the optical redshift of the central elliptical galaxy of a known cluster identified by a red sequence. Additionally, we detect a radio lobe east of the X-ray feature, likely produced by an AGN offset from the cluster center and confined primarily by ram pressure from the ambient medium. The lobe shows a steep nonthermal radio spectrum, suggesting a cosmic-ray age of $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{7}$~yr. Assuming energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields, we estimate the lobe's total energy to be $\sim 9 \times 10^{56}~\mathrm{erg}$, comparable to the thermal energy in the same volume. This study thus identifies a background young cluster projected next to KUG~1138+327 and highlights the potentially significant role of off-center AGN feedback in shaping the intracluster medium.   

Hot, cold, and multi-component accretion flows around supermassive black

  We develop a model for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) accreting below their Eddington limit, focusing on systems where hot, advection-dominated flows become viable. We specifically explore the spectral appearance of multi-component accretion flows where the solution can independently transition between cold, thin disks and hot, advection-dominated torii depending on the local accretion rate. Using a three-disk model, we compute spectral energy distributions for four possible accretion configurations and assess their observational signatures, including which frequencies might reflect variability at the binary orbital period. The spectral modeling reveals that binary accretion can self-consistently account for many of the properties of standard AGN, while the variability analysis shows that hydrodynamic modulation at the binary period is most likely in the thermal emission and low-frequency synchrotron components. Doppler boosting of emitting material bound to a single binary component would also induce periodic variability. We apply our model to the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and demonstrate that a mixed-component accretion state (plus a jet feature) can self-consistently capture the observed broadband spectrum. Our model offers a framework for interpreting candidate SMBHBs and motivates future multi-wavelength follow-up of potential multi-messenger sources, as well as more detailed future modeling of multi-component binary accretion.
