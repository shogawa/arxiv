  We evaluate the contribution to the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background (IGRB) coming from Radio Galaxies (RGs), the subclass of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the highest misalignment from the line of sight (l.o.s.). Since only a small number of RGs are detected in gamma rays compared to the largest known radio population, the correlation between radio and gamma-ray emission serves as a crucial tool to characterize the gamma-ray properties of these sources. We analyse the population of RGs using two samples. The first sample contains 26 sources individually detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at gamma rays. The second sample contains 210 RGs for which the gamma-ray emission is not significantly detected by the LAT. We use a stacking analysis to characterize the average properties of the gamma-ray emission of the two samples, separately at first and then combined. We then evaluate the correlation between their gamma-ray emission and the emission from their radio core at 5 GHz, and we use it to determine their contribution to the IGRB. Due to the limited number of RGs detected at the gamma-rays, information on the gamma-ray luminosity function is limited. The correlation between the gamma-ray emission and the emission of the radio core allows us to characterize it starting from the luminosity function of the radio cores, which is modeled with greater accuracy due to the larger number of sources detected at these frequencies. We find that the diffuse emission as extrapolated from the properties of the subthreshold RGs is lower than the one inferred from detected RGs, showing that the contribution of the population of RGs to the IGRB is lower than the previous estimates and it is around the 30% level of the IGRB intensity.

  We report the first 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation that captures the full, self-consistent evolution from the late inspiral through merger and subsequent recoil of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) with misaligned spins embedded in an equilibrated circumbinary disk (CBD). Our full numerical simulation follows the final 40 orbits of the inspiral and merger of the binary, following an initial phase of 165 orbits of CBD evolution toward equilibrium. We find that the jets, launched from the minidisks surrounding each black hole, are tilted toward the black hole spin direction close to the individual black holes, but align with the binary's total angular momentum at larger distances. Following the merger, the remnant black hole receives a recoil kick exceeding 1000 km/s. Remarkably, it retains its gravitationally bound CBD as if it were ejected from a galactic nucleus. Furthermore, the jet launched by the recoiling remnant black hole preserves the large-scale orientation established during the late inspiral. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity emerges from a region in close proximity to the black hole, suggesting that the accretion disk surrounding the recoiling remnant would remain the most luminous feature postmerger, persisting for long enough to be observable by modern telescopes (hours in the case of LISA sources). These findings introduce a direct, first-principles model for the recoil of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), offering a comprehensive theoretical basis to support and elucidate both ongoing and future observational efforts.

  Accretion rates in radio galaxies are typically estimated from optical and total radio flux measurements, incorporating emission from the core, jets, and lobes. These estimates can be used to investigate the link between observed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission properties and the underlying accretion physics of their Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). However, while optical and core radio emission trace the ongoing accretion episode, extended jet and lobe structures may result from past AGN activity. Therefore, accretion rates inferred from spatially unresolved radio observations may be systematically overestimated, a bias whose prevalence and extent have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this study, using a sample of 121 local radio-loud galaxies with spatially resolved radio components, we assess this effect by estimating their \textit{Eddington}-scaled accretion rates ($\lambda$) using both the common methodology which considers total radio fluxes and a simple but novel approach that treats core and extended emission as signatures of distinct accretion phases. Our results show that the former method systematically overestimates the $\lambda$ by a factor of $\sim 3$, affecting the accretion mode classification in approximately $11\%$ of sources. This discrepancy appears to correlate with radio size, with the most extended galaxies indicating a transition in accretion disk mode. Such a bias could affect AGN classification in unresolved high-redshift radio surveys. Our results motivate re-examining accretion rate calculations from AGN radio surveys and align with the AGN unification model for radio galaxies, revealing a clearer link between accretion disk physics and optical spectral properties.

  We utilize a large sample of $\sim$113,000 galaxies ($z &lt; 0.3$) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with high-quality data to compare star formation rates (SFRs) across multiple diagnostic methods and examine their connection to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) strength, indicated by Eddington ratio. Our sample encompassed star-forming (SF), composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies. Our analysis utilizes various SFRs indicators, including observed infrared flux ($\rm SFR_{FIR}$) from AKARI/Herschel ($\sim$4,100 sources), the MPA-JHU catalog ($\rm SFR_{Dn4000}$), the ANN catalog ($\rm SFR_{ANN}$), the GSWLC catalog ($\rm SFR_{SED}$ and $\rm SFR_{MIR}$), as well as \OII\ and \Ha\ emission lines ($\rm SFR_{[OII]}$ and $\rm SFR_{H\alpha}$). Within SF galaxies, SFRs measurements from different tracers exhibited differences, with offsets and scatter below 0.26 dex and 0.29 dex, respectively. Moreover, non-SF galaxies (composite, Seyfert, and LINER) displayed discrepancies among SFR tracers, particularly for LINER galaxies, with offsets below 0.86 dex and a scatter of 0.57 dex. Additionally, our findings revealed robust correlations between SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs) with Eddington ratios. Eddington ratio exhibited gradual transitions in the (s)SFRs-stellar mass diagrams. Galaxies with high Eddington ratios displayed high star formation activity, similar to blue SF galaxies. Furthermore, we observed decreasing sSFR trends from SF galaxies to composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies. Our results may provide insight into our understanding of (s)SFRs traced by different approaches and their connection to AGN activities.

  We present a comprehensive long-term multi-wavelength study of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 3822, based on 17 years (2008 to 2025) of X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and optical observations.The dataset includes observations from Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, the Very Large Telescope, and the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. Our multiwavelength light curve analysis reveals flux variations across X-ray to optical/UV bands, with an increased variability amplitude at shorter wavelengths. X-ray spectral analysis indicates the presence of intrinsic absorption during the 2016 and 2022 observations; however, this absorption disappeared before and after these epochs. The presence and absence of the absorber are attributed to clouds moving in and out of the line of sight. During the long-term monitoring period, the bolometric luminosity of the source varies between ($1.32-17)\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Optical spectroscopic monitoring reveals changing-look (CL) behaviour in NGC~3822, characterized by the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines (BELs). These CL transitions are associated with changes in the Eddington ratio rather than changes in the obscuration. The BELs appear only when the Eddington ratio is relatively high ($\sim 3.8\times10^{-3}$) and disappear when it drops to a lower value ($\sim 0.9\times10^{-3}$).

  Context: Most active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to be surrounded by a dusty molecular torus on the parsec scale which is often embedded within a larger circumnuclear disk (CND). AGN are fuelled by the inward transport of material through these structures and can launch multi-phase outflows that influence the host galaxy through AGN feedback. Aims: We use the Circinus Galaxy as a nearby laboratory to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for feeding the torus and launching a multi-phase outflow in this Seyfert-type AGN, as these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: We analysed observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of the Circinus nucleus at angular resolutions down to 13 mas (0.25 pc). We traced dust and the ionised outflow using 86-665 GHz continuum emission, and studied the morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. Results: We find that the Circinus CND hosts molecular and dusty spiral arms, two of which connect directly to the torus. We detect inward mass transport along these structures and argue that the non-axisymmetric potential generated by these arms is the mechanism responsible for fuelling the torus. We estimate a feeding rate of 0.3-7.5 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, implying that over 88% of the inflowing material is expelled in a multi-phase outflow before reaching the accretion disk. The inferred torus feeding time scale (120 kyr - 2.7 Myr) suggests that variability in AGN activity may be driven by changes in torus feeding. On parsec scales, the ionised outflow is traced by optically thin free-free emission. The outflow is stratified, with a slightly wider opening angle in the molecular phase than in the dusty and ionised components. The ionised outflow is launched or collimated by a warped accretion disk at a radius of r ~ 0.16 pc, and its geometry requires an anisotropic launching mechanism.
