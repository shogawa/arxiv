  Narrow emission lines in a galaxy's spectrum that show double peaks indicate the presence of distinct gas components with different velocities, and its physical origin remains uncertain. This study uses galaxies from the final MaNGA data release to detect double-peaked narrow emission-line spaxels (DPSs) by examining the double Gaussian profiles of the H$ \alpha $-[N \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}] doublets across all MaNGA spaxels. A total of 5,420 DPSs associated with 304 double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies (DPGs) are identified, each DPG containing a minimum of 5 DPSs and being free from overlap with other galaxies. We find that DPSs can be categorized into three groups according to their central distance $r/R_e$ and the velocity difference $\Delta v$ between their two components: the inner low-$\Delta v$, inner high-$\Delta v$ and outer DPSs. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the DPGs into their DPSs, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of statistical correlations between barred DPGs and inner low-$\Delta v$ DPSs, AGN-hosting DPGs and inner high-$\Delta v$ DPSs, as well as tidal DPGs and outer DPSs.

  We present a novel way to probe inelastic dark matter using cosmic-ray (CR) cooling in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Dark matter (DM) in the vicinity of supermassive black holes may scatter off CRs, resulting in the rapid cooling of CRs for sufficiently large cross sections. This in turn can alter the high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes detected from these sources. We show that AGN cooling bounds obtained through the multimessenger data of NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 allow to reach unprecedently large mass splittings for inelastic DM ($\gtrsim$ TeV), orders of magnitude larger than those probed by direct detection experiments and DM capture in neutron stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooling bounds from AGNs can probe thermal light DM with small mass splittings. This provides novel and complementary constraints in parts of a parameter space accessible solely by colliders and beam dump experiments.

  We present star formation rates (SFR), the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), and the SFR-dependent MZR across redshifts 4 to 10 using 81 star-forming galaxies observed by the JWST NIRSpec employing both low-resolution PRISM and medium-resolution gratings, including galaxies from the JADES GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields, the JWST-PRIMAL Legacy Survey, and additional galaxies from the literature in Abell 2744, SMACS-0723, RXJ2129, BDF, COSMOS, and MACS1149 fields. These galaxies span a 3 dex stellar mass range of $10^7 &lt; M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} &lt; 10^{10}$, with an average SFR of $7.2 \pm 1.2 M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ and an average metallicity of $12+{\rm log(O/H)} = 7.91 \pm 0.08$. Our findings align with previous observations up to $z=8$ for the MZR and indicate no deviation from local universe FMR up to this redshift. Beyond $z=8$, we observe a significant deviation $\sim 0.27$ dex) in FMR, consistent with recent JWST findings. We also integrate CEERS (135 galaxies) and JADES (47 galaxies) samples with our data to study metallicity evolution with redshift in a combined sample of 263 galaxies, revealing a decreasing metallicity trend with a slope of $0.067 \pm 0.013$, consistent with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, but contradicts with FIRE simulations. We introduce an empirical mass-metallicity-redshift (MZ-$z$ relation): $12+{\rm log(O/H)}=6.29 + 0.237 \times{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) - 0.06 \times (1+z)$, which accurately reproduces the observed trends in metallicity with both redshift and stellar mass. This trend underscores the ``Grand Challenge'' in understanding the factors driving high-redshift galactic metallicity trends, such as inflow, outflow, and AGN/stellar feedback -- and emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger samples and enhanced simulations.
