Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys offer a unique new landscape in which to learn in both spatial and spectroscopic dimensions and could help uncover previously unknown insights into galaxy evolution. In this work, we demonstrate a new unsupervised deep learning framework using Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory Network Autoencoders to encode generalized feature representations across both spatial and spectroscopic dimensions spanning $19$ optical emission lines (3800A $&lt; λ&lt;$ 8000A) among a sample of $\sim 9000$ galaxies from the MaNGA IFS survey. As a demonstrative exercise, we assess our model on a sample of $290$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and highlight scientifically interesting characteristics of some highly anomalous AGN.

Neutral gas outflows play a crucial role in the baryon cycle of galaxies, their properties provide key insights into the transition from star formation to quiescence. In this work, we investigate the neutral gas outflow of 23 massive ($M_\star = 10^{10.1-11.6}\,\rm M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z=2.82--4.61, selected from the JWST NIRSpec (R~1000) and NIRCam program DeepDive. We trace the neutral gas outflows using the NaI Doublet absorption lines and detect excess NaI D in 13/23 (57%) targets, of which 7/23 (30%) show blueshifted absorption with velocity offsets $|Δv|$ &gt;~ 150 km/s. The z ~ 3.5 targets have $Δv$ similar to those of their local counterparts; they are also equivalent when compared in SFR--$Δv$ space. We derive mass outflow rates and identify the most extreme neutral gas outflow rate $\log(\dot M_{\rm out} / \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr}^{-1})=2.68\pm0.27$ beyond the local Universe, coincident with an X-ray AGN. For all NaI D detected systems, the inferred mass outflow rate can, in principle, suppress ongoing star formation; however, the outflows are unlikely to escape their hosts, suggesting recycling on relatively short timescales (~3--180 Myr), depending on the assumed potential and launching radius. All NaI D detected targets occupy the LI(N)ER region of the BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but we find no strong correlation between ongoing AGN and the neutral outflow: 2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs are NaI D undetected -- yet, the outflows can be powered by fossil/episodic AGNs, and one broad-line target shows a possible P-Cygni profile that indicates strong outflows. As neutral outflows alone are not able to permanently quench star formation by removing gas in our sample at z ~ 3.5, the presence of gas cycling in and out of massive passive systems may instead be the signature of feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes.
