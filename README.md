  Recent observations are shedding light on the important role that active galactic nuclei (AGN) play in the production of high-energy neutrinos. In this study, we focus on one object, 5BZB J0630-2406, which is among the blazars recently proposed as associated with neutrino emission during the first 7-yr IceCube observations. Modelling the quasi-simultaneous, broad-band spectral energy distribution, we explore various scenarios from purely leptonic to lepto-hadronic models, testing the inclusion of external photon fields. This theoretical study provides a complementary testing ground for the proposed neutrino-blazar association. Despite being historically classified as a BL Lac, our study shows that 5BZB J0630-2406 belongs to the relatively rare sub-class of high-power flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Our results indicate that interactions between protons and external radiation fields can produce a neutrino flux that is within the reach of the IceCube detector. Furthermore, the spectral shape of the X-ray emission suggests the imprint of hadronic processes related to very energetic protons.

  We have identified a broad absorption line (BAL) outflow in the HST/STIS spectrum of the quasar QSO B0254-3327B at velocity $v=-3200\text{ km s$^{-1}$}$. The outflow has absorption troughs from ions such as Ne VIII, Na IX, Si XII, and Ne V. We also report the first detection of S XIV absorption troughs, implying very high ionization. Via measurement of the ionic column densities, photoionization analysis, and determination of the electron number density of the outflow, we found the kinetic luminosity of the outflow system to be up to $\sim1\%$ of the quasar's Eddington luminosity, or $\sim2\%$ of the bolometric luminosity, making it a potential contributor to AGN feedback. A solution with two ionization phases was needed, as a single phase was not sufficient to satisfy the constraints from the measured ionic column densities. We find that the ionization parameter of the very high-ionization phase of the outflow is within the expected range of an X-ray warm absorber as described by arXiv:astro-ph/0309096. We also examined the physical properties of the outflow of Q0254-334 along with previously studied extreme UV outflows, with a total sample of 24 outflow systems, finding a weak negative correlation between outflow velocity and distance from the central source. The very high-ionization phase of the Q0254-334 outflow has one of the highest ionization parameters of UV absorption outflows to date, which we attribute to the presence of S XIV.

  The latest entry in the jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) family is the Fanaroff-Riley type 0 (FR0) radio galaxies. They share several observational characteristics, e.g., nuclear emission and host galaxy morphology, with FR I sources; however, they lack extended, kiloparsec-scale radio structures, which are the defining features of canonical FR I and II sources. Here we report the identification of 7 gamma-ray emitting AGN as FR0 radio sources by utilizing the high-quality observations delivered by ongoing multi-wavelength wide-field sky surveys, e.g., Very Large Array Sky Survey. The broadband observational properties of these objects are found to be similar to their gamma-ray undetected counterparts. In the gamma-ray band, FR0 radio galaxies exhibit spectral features similar to more common FR I and II radio galaxies, indicating a common gamma-ray production mechanism and the presence of misaligned jets. Although the parsec-scale radio structure of FR0s generally exhibits a wide range, with about half having emission on opposite sides of the core, the gamma-ray detected FR0s tend to have dominant cores with core-jet structures. We conclude that dedicated, high-resolution observations are needed to unravel the origin of relativistic jets in this enigmatic class of faint yet numerous population of compact radio sources.   

On the origin of star-formation quenching in massive galaxies at $z
  \gtrsim 3$ in the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG

  Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG, we perform a comprehensive analysis of quiescent, massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$. The goal is to understand what suppresses their star formation so early in cosmic time, and how other similar mass galaxies remain highly star-forming. We find that active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback is the primary cause of halting star formation in early, massive galaxies. Not only do the central supermassive black holes of the quenched galaxies have earlier seed times, but they also grow faster than in star-forming galaxies. As a result, the quenched galaxies are exposed to AGN feedback for longer, and experience the kinetic, jet mode of the AGN feedback earlier than the star-forming galaxies. The release of kinetic energy reduces inflows of gas while likely maintaining outflows, which keeps a low cold gas fraction and decreases the star formation of the galaxies down to a state of quiescence. In addition to AGN feedback, we also investigate the influence of the large-scale environment. While mergers do not play a significant role in the quenching process, the quenched galaxies tend to reside in more massive halos and denser regions during their evolution. As this provides a greater initial amount of infalling gas to the galaxies, the large-scale environment can mildly affect the fate of the central black hole growth and, via AGN feedback, contribute to star-formation quenching.

  We consider the effect of including an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) component when fitting spectral energy distributions of 109 spectroscopically confirmed $z\approx 3.5-12.5$ galaxies with JWST. Remarkably, we find that the resulting cosmic star formation history is $\approx 0.9$ dex lower at $z\gtrsim 9.5$ when an AGN component is included in the fitting. This alleviates previously reported excess star formation at $z\gtrsim 9.5$ compared to models based on typical baryon conversion efficiencies inside dark matter halos. We find that the individual stellar masses and star formation rates can be as much as $\approx 4$ dex lower when fitting with an AGN component. These results highlight the importance of considering both stellar mass assembly and super massive black hole growth when interpreting the light distributions of among the first galaxies to ever exist.

  Merger events can trigger gas accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) sitting at the centre of galaxies, and form close pairs of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The fraction of AGN in pairs gives key information to constrain the environmental properties and evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. However, the identification of dual AGN is difficult, and only very few have been found in the distant Universe so far. We report the serendipitous discovery of a triple AGN and four dual AGN (one considered as a candidate), with projected separations in the range 3-28 kpc. Their AGN classification is mostly based on classical optical emission line flux ratios, as observed with the Near-InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and is complemented with additional multi-wavelength diagnostics. The identification of these multiple AGN out of the 17 AGN systems in our GA-NIFS survey (i.e. ~ 20-30%), suggests that they might be more common than expected from the most recent cosmological simulations, which predict a fraction of dual AGN at least one order of magnitude smaller. This work highlights the exceptional capabilities of NIRSpec for detecting distant dual AGN, and prompts new investigations to better constrain their fraction across the cosmic time, and to inform upcoming cosmological simulations.
