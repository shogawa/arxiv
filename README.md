  A fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have double-peaked H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Mg II broad lines attributed to emission from rotating gas in the accretion disk. Using optical spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of AGN selected via ultrahard X-rays from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we systematically identify 71 double-peaked emitters amongst 343 broad-line AGN with redshifts $0.004&lt;z&lt;0.297$ and 2-10 KeV X-ray luminosities of log 40-45.7 (erg/s), and provide their best-fit accretion disk geometry parameters. We find that ~21% of X-ray selected broad-line AGN are double-peaked emitters (DPEs), consistent with rates previously reported for $z&lt;0.2$ broad-line AGN selected for strong optical variability in ZTF. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a single-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the double-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher masses by ~0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ~0.3 dex than other broad-line AGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray luminosities, and higher [OI] $\lambda$6302 to narrow H$\alpha$ flux ratios than other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from other broad-line AGN in the $L_{\rm bol}$ vs $M_{\rm BH}$ relation or their X-ray to radio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert types over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of multi-wavelength properties when comparing DPEs to other broad-line AGN, including optical and mid-IR variability levels, and the rate of changing-look events. We discuss the two populations in the context of multi-component disk-wind models of the AGN broad line region and consider how unrecognized contributions of disk emission to the broad lines introduce biases in virial SMBH mass estimates.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to play a central role in quenching star formation by removing or destroying molecular gas from host galaxies via radiation-pressure driven outflows and/or radio jets. Some studies of cold molecular gas in galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$) show that AGN have less cold gas ($&lt;$100 K) compared to mass-matched star-forming galaxies. However, cold gas could also be shock-heated to warmer phases, detectable via H$_{2}$ transitions in the rest-frame near- and mid-infrared spectra. The Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) of the Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard JWST has opened a unique window to observe these emission lines in galaxies at Cosmic Noon. We present the first detection of hot molecular gas in cid_346, an X-ray AGN at $z\sim2.2$, via the H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transition at 2.12 $\mu$m. We measure a hot molecular gas mass of $\sim 8.0 \times 10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is $\sim 10^{5}-10^{6}$ times lower than the cold molecular gas mass. cid_346 is located in an environment with extended gas structures and satellite galaxies. This is supported by detection of hot and cold molecular gas out to distances $&gt;$10 kpc in MIRI/MRS and ALMA data, respectively and ancillary NIRCam imaging that reveals two satellite galaxies at distances of $\sim$0.4 arcsec (3.3 kpc) and $\sim$0.9 arcsec (7.4 kpc) from the AGN. Our results tentatively indicate that while the CO(3-2)-based cold gas phase dominates the molecular gas mass at Cosmic Noon, H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transitions are effective in tracing hot molecular gas locally in regions that may lack CO emission.

  We investigate the influence of supernova (SN) feedback on the satellites of elliptical host galaxies using hydrodynamic simulations. Utilizing a modified version of the GADGET-3 code, we perform cosmological zoom-in simulations of 11 elliptical galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^{11} M_{\odot} &lt; M_{*} &lt; 2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We conduct two sets of simulations with identical initial conditions: the Fiducial model, which includes a three-phase SN mechanical wind, and the weak SN feedback model, where nearly all SN energy is released as thermal energy with a reduced SN wind velocity. Our comparison shows minimal differences in the elliptical host galaxies, but significant variations in the physical properties of satellite galaxies. The weak SN feedback model produces a larger number of satellite galaxies compared to the Fiducial model, and significantly more than observed. For satellite galaxies with stellar masses above $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$, the weak SN feedback model generates approximately five times more satellites than observed in the xSAGA survey. Most of these overproduced satellites have small stellar masses, below $10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, satellites in the weak SN feedback model are about 3.5 times more compact than those observed in the SAGA survey and the Fiducial model, with metallicities nearly 1 dex higher than observed values. In conclusion, the satellite galaxies in the Fiducial model, which includes mechanical SN feedback, exhibit properties more closely aligned with observations. This underscores the necessity of incorporating both mechanical AGN and SN feedback to reproduce the observed properties of elliptical galaxy and their satellites in simulations.
