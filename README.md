  We present a study of the morphology of star formation and the associated nuclear activity in a sample of 8 closely interacting southern galaxies, which are in different stages of interaction, starting with nearly merged nuclei that have one prominent bulge to more widely spaced interacting galaxies. We have used Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) observations from the Ultraviolet Imaging telescope (UVIT), near-Infrared observations from the infrared survey facility telescope (IRSF) and archival optical data from the VLT/MUSE integral field spectrograph. Analysing resolved stellar populations across the disk of the interacting galaxies can provide unique insights into how interactions affect galaxy properties, such as morphology, star formation rates and chemical composition. We take advantage of the unprecedented capabilities of MUSE and UVIT to carry out a highly detailed spatially and spectrally resolved study of star formation rate, star formation histories, metallicity and AGN activity in the sample of eight interacting galaxies which are in different stages of interaction. Most of our sample galaxies are gas-rich and show evidence of recent, massive star formation in tidal tails, rings and spiral arms. This is evident from their FUV and H$\alpha$ emissions, which trace young, massive star-forming regions. We compared the star formation rate in the barred and unbarred galaxies in our sample and found that the barred galaxies do not show significant enhancement in star formation rate or large-scale difference in star formation morphology compared to unbarred galaxies. IC5250 and NGC7733N, show extended nuclear outflows of size $\sim$ 5 kpc and 8 kpc respectively.

  In this paper we investigate the role of AGN feedback on the late stage evolution of elliptical galaxies by performing high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation in the {\it MACER} framework. By comparing models that take into account different feedback mechanisms, namely AGN and stellar feedback, we find that AGN feedback is crucial in keeping the black hole in a low accretion state and suppressing the star formation. We then compare the energy from AGN radiation and wind deposited in the galaxy and find that only wind can compensate for the radiative cooling of the gas in the galaxy. Further, we investigate which plays the dominant role, the wind from the cold (quasar) or hot (radio) feedback modes, by examining the cumulative energy output and impact area to which the wind can heat the interstellar medium and suppress star formation. Our results indicate that first, although AGN spends most of its time in hot (radio) mode, the cumulative energy output is dominated by the outburst of the cold mode. Second, only the impact area of the cold-mode wind is large enough to heat the gas in the halo, while the hot-mode wind is not. Additionally, the cold-mode wind is capable of sweeping up the material from stellar mass loss. These results indicate the dominant role of cold-mode wind. The limitations of our model, including the absence of jet feedback, are discussed.

  We separately assess elemental abundances in AGNs' broad and narrow emission line regions (BLR and NLR), based on a critical assessment of published results together with new photoionization models. We find 1) He/H enhancements in some AGN, exceeding what can be explained by normal chemical evolution and confirm 2) super-solar {\alpha} abundance, though to a lesser degree than previously reported. We also reaffirm 3) a N/O ratio consistent with secondary production; 4) solar or slightly sub-solar Fe abundance; and 5) red-shift independent metallicity, in contrast with galactic chemical evolution. We interpret 6) the larger metallicity in the BLR than NRL in terms of an in situ stellar evolution and pollution in AGN discs (SEPAD) model. We attribute: a) the redshift independence to the heavy element pollutants being disposed into the disc and accreted onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH); b) the limited He excess to the accretion-wind metabolism of a top-heavy population of evolving massive main sequence stars; c) the super-solar CNO enrichment to the nuclear synthesis during their post-main-sequence evolution; d) the large N/O to the byproduct of multiple stellar generations; and e) the Mg, Si, and Fe to the ejecta of type II supernovae in the disc. These results provide supporting evidence for f) ongoing self-regulated star formation, g) adequate stellar luminosity to maintain marginal gravitational stability, h) prolific production of seeds and i) dense coexistence of subsequently-grown residual black hole populations in AGN discs.

  We present the first results of a high-cadence Swift monitoring campaign ($3-4$ visits per day for $75$ days) of the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 6814 characterizing its variability throughout the X-ray and UV/optical wavebands. Structure function analysis reveals an X-ray power law ($\alpha=0.5^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$) that is significantly flatter than the one measured in the UV/optical bands ($\langle\alpha\rangle\approx1.5$), suggesting different physical mechanisms driving the observed variability in each emission region. The structure function break-time is consistent across the UV/optical bands ($\langle\tau\rangle\approx2.3~\mathrm{d}$), suggesting a very compact emission region in the disc. Correlated short time-scale variability measured through cross-correlation analysis finds a lag-wavelength spectrum that is inconsistent with a standard disc reprocessing scenario ($\tau\propto\lambda^{4/3}$) due to significant flattening in the optical wavebands. Flux-flux analysis finds an extremely blue AGN spectral component ($F_{\nu}\propto\lambda^{-0.85}$) that does not follow a standard accretion disc profile ($F_{\nu}\propto\lambda^{-1/3}$). While extreme outer disc truncation ($R_{\mathrm{out}}=202\pm5~r_g$) at a standard accretion rate ($\dot{m}_{\mathrm{Edd}}=0.0255\pm0.0006$) may explain the shape of the AGN spectral component, the lag-wavelength spectrum requires more modest truncation ($R_{\mathrm{out}}=1,382^{+398}_{-404}~r_g$) at an extreme accretion rate ($\dot{m}_{\mathrm{Edd}}=1.3^{+2.1}_{-0.9}$). No combination of parameters can simultaneously explain both results in a self-consistent way. Our results offer the first evidence of a non-standard accretion disc in NGC 6814.
