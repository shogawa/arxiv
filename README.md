  We present two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of $\sim$kpc-scale AGN jets with mean jet powers in the range $1-7\times10^{45}\,$erg~s$^{-1}$, in which the jet power varies (through variation of the Lorentz factor) according to a flicker or pink noise power spectrum. We find the morphology and dynamics of the jet-cocoon system depends on the amplitude of the variability with a clear correspondence between the shape of the cocoon and the historical activity. The jet advances quickly during high-power states, whereas quiescent periods instead produce passive periods of inflation resembling Sedov-Taylor blast waves. Periods of high activity preferentially produce hotspots and create stronger backflow as they maximise the pressure gradient between the jet head and cocoon. The variability can also lead to propagating internal shock structures along the jet. Our work suggests that variability and flickering in the jet power has important implications, which we discuss, for observations of radio galaxies, ultrahigh energy cosmic ray acceleration and jet power to luminosity correlations. We explore the link between morphology and fuelling, and suggest that chaotic cold accretion should introduce a relatively small scatter in radio luminosity ($\sim0.2$ dex) and modest imprints on morphology; sources such as Hercules A and Fornax A, which show evidence for more dramatic variability, may therefore require redder power spectra, or be triggered by mergers or other discrete events. We suggest ways to search for jet flickering observationally and propose that radio galaxies may be an important diagnostic of Myr timescale AGN fuelling, due to their `long-term memory'.

  We present the redshift evolution of quasar luminosity functions decomposed by halo mass, galaxy mass, supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, and Eddington ratio, as well as SMBH kinetic/radiative energy output ratios from TRINITY, a flexible empirical model that self-consistently infers the halo--galaxy--SMBH connection that match observational data. Key findings include: 1) The normalization of QLF increases by ~3-4 dex from z~10 to z~4, due to the fast mass build-up of different SMBH populations; 2) From z~4 to z~1, less massive galaxies and SMBHs make up bigger and bigger fractions of QLFs, due to the AGN downsizing effect; 3) At z~0, massive haloes/galaxies/SMBHs are responsible for most bright quasars due to low Eddington ratios among all SMBHs; 4) The bright ends of quasar luminosity functions (QLFs) are dominated by SMBHs that are at least 0.3 dex over-massive relative to the median SMBH mass-galaxy mass relation; 5) QLFs at z~6-7 are dominated by SMBHs accreting at Eddington ratios 0.1 &lt; $\eta_\mathrm{rad}$ &lt; 1, but super-Eddington AGNs dominate QLFs towards z~9-10.
