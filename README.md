  Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a new class of high redshift (high-$z$, $z&gt;4$) compact galaxies which are red in the rest-frame optical and blue in the rest-frame UV as V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs), referred to as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). It is very likely that LRDs host obscured broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In the meanwhile, Green pea galaxies (GPs), which are compact dwarf galaxies at low redshift, share various similar properties with high redshift star-forming galaxies. Here we aim to find the connection between the LRDs and GPs hosting broad-line AGNs (BLGPs). With a sample of 19 BLGPs obtained from our previous work, we further identify 7 GPs with V-shaped rest-frame UV-to-optical SEDs that are likely local analogs to LRDs. These V-shaped BLGPs exhibit faint UV absolute magnitudes and sub-Eddington rates similar to those of LRDs. Three of them occupy a similar region as LRDs in the BPT diagram, suggesting they have similar ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicities to LRDs. These similarities suggest that V-shaped BLGPs can be taken as local analogs of high-redshift LRDs. In addition, most (16/19) BLGPs, including 6 V-shaped BLGPs, host over-massive black holes above the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{*}$ relation, making it the first sample of galaxies hosting over-massive black holes at $z&lt;0.4$. These findings will help us learn more about the formation and co-evolution of early galaxies and black holes.

  In this study, we demonstrate some of the caveats in common statistical methods used for analysing astronomical variability timescales. We consider these issues specifically in the context of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and use a more practical approach compared to mathematics literature, where the number of formulae may sometimes be overwhelming. We conducted a thorough literature review both on the statistical properties of light-curve data, specifically in the context of sampling effects, as well as on the methods used to analyse them. We simulated a wide range of data to test some of the known issues in AGN variability analysis as well as to investigate previously unknown or undocumented caveats. We discovered problems with some commonly used methods and confirmed how challenging it is to identify timescales from observed data. We find that interpolation of a light curve with biased sampling, specifically with bias towards flaring events, affects its measured power spectral density in a different manner than those of simulated light curves. We also find that an algorithm aiming to match the probability density function of a light curve has often been used incorrectly. These new issues appear to have been mostly overlooked and not necessarily addressed before, especially in astronomy literature.

  The interactions between jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their stellar environments significantly influence jet dynamics and emission characteristics. In low-power jets, such as those in Fanaroff-Riley I (FR I) galaxies, the jet-star interactions can notably affect jet deceleration and energy dissipation.   Recent numerical studies suggest that mass loading from stellar winds is a key factor in decelerating jets, accounting for many observed characteristics in FR I jets. Additionally, a radio-optical positional offset has been observed, with optical emission detected further down the jet than radio emission. This observation may challenge traditional explanations based solely on recollimation shocks and instabilities.   This work utilizes the radiative transfer code RIPTIDE to generate synthetic synchrotron maps, from a population of re-accelerated electrons, in both radio and optical bands from jet simulations incorporating various mass-loading profiles and distributions of gas and stars within the ambient medium.   Our findings emphasize the importance of mass entrainment in replicating the extended and diffuse radio/optical emissions observed in FR I jets and explaining the radio-optical offsets. These offsets are influenced by the galaxy's physical properties, the surrounding stellar populations, and observational biases. We successfully reproduce typical radio-optical offsets by considering a mass-load equivalent to $10^{-9}~M_\odot \cdot \rm{yr}^{-1} \cdot \rm{pc}^{-3}$. Overall, our results demonstrate that positive offset measurements are a promising tool for revealing the fundamental properties of galaxies and potentially their stellar populations, particularly in the context of FR I jets.

  We use a sample of 11 $z\approx0.2-0.5$ ($z_{\text{med.}} = 0.36$) galaxy clusters from the Cluster Lensing And Supernovae survey with Hubble (CLASH) to analyse the angular dependence of satellite galaxy colour $(B-R)$ and passive galaxy fractions ($f_{\text{pass.}}$) with respect to the major axis of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). This phenomenon has been dubbed as \say{anisotropic quenching}, \say{angular conformity} or \say{angular segregation}, and it describes how satellite galaxies along the major axis of the BCG are more likely to be quenched than those along the minor axis. We are the first to measure anisotropic quenching out to $3R_{200}$ ($R_{200\text{, med.}} \approx 933$ \si{\kilo\parsec}) from the cluster centre. A highly significant anisotropic quenching signal is found for satellites with a peak in $(B-R)$ and $f_{\text{pass.}}$ along the major axis. We find that the anisotropic quenching signal is significant out to at least $2.5R_{200}$, and the amplitude of the sinusoidal fit peaks at $\approx1.25R_{200}$. This is the first time the radial peak of the anisotropic quenching signal has been measured directly. Finally, we find that $f_{\text{pass.}}$ is significantly higher along the major axis for fixed values of local surface density. The density drops less rapidly along the major axis and so satellites spend more time being pre-processed here compared to the minor axis. We therefore conclude that pre-processing in large-scale structure, and not active galactic nuclei (AGN) outflows, is the likely cause of the anisotropic quenching signal in massive galaxy clusters, however this may not be the cause in lower mass halos.
