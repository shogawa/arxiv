  We present the number densities and physical properties of the bright galaxies spectroscopically confirmed at $z\sim7-14$. Our sample is composed of 53 galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}\sim7-14$, including recently-confirmed galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}=12.34-14.32$ with JWST, as well as new confirmations at $z_\mathrm{spec}=6.583-7.643$ with $-24&lt; M_\mathrm{UV}&lt; -21$ mag using ALMA and Keck. Our JWST/NIRSpec observations have also revealed that very bright galaxy candidates at $z\sim10-13$ identified from ground-based telescope images before JWST are passive galaxies at $z\sim3-4$, emphasizing the necessity of strict screening and spectroscopy in the selection of the brightest galaxies at $z&gt;10$. The UV luminosity functions derived from these spectroscopic results are consistent with a double power-law function, showing tensions with theoretical models at the bright end. To understand the origin of the overabundance of bright galaxies, we investigate their morphologies using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution images obtained in various surveys including PRIMER and COSMOS-Web. We find that $\sim70\%$ of the bright galaxies at $z\sim7$ exhibit clumpy morphologies with multiple sub-components, suggesting merger-induced starburst activity, which is consistent with SED fitting results showing bursty star formation histories. At $z\gtrsim10$, bright galaxies are classified into two types of galaxies; extended ones with weak high-ionization emission lines, and compact ones with strong high-ionization lines including NIV]$\lambda$1486, indicating that at least two different processes (e.g., merger-induced starburst and compact star formation/AGN) are shaping the physical properties of the brightest galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ and are responsible for their overabundance.

  We present Virgil, a MIRI extremely red object (MERO) detected with the F1000W filter as part of the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). Virgil is a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z_{spec} = 6.6312\pm 0.0019$ (from VLT/MUSE) with a rest-frame UV-to-optical spectral energy distribution (SED) typical of LAEs at similar redshifts. However, MIRI observations reveal an unexpected extremely red color at rest-frame near-infrared wavelengths, $\rm F444W - F1000W = 2.33 \pm 0.06$. Such steep rise in the near-infrared, completely missed without MIRI imaging, is poorly reproduced by models including only stellar populations and hints towards the presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Interestingly, the overall SED shape of Virgil resembles that of the recently discovered population of Little Red Dots (LRDs) but does not meet their compactness criterion: at rest-frame UV-optical wavelengths Virgil's morphology follows a 2D-S\'ersic profile with average index $n = 0.93^{+0.85}_{-0.31}$ and $r_e = 0.43$~pkpc. Only at MIRI wavelengths Virgil is unresolved due to the coarser PSF. We also estimate a bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol} = (8.4-11.1)\times 10^{44}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ and a supermassive black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = (4-7)\times 10^7\rm ~ M_\odot$ in agreement with recently reported values for LRDs. This discovery demonstrates the crucial importance of deep MIRI surveys to find AGN amongst high-$z$ galaxies that otherwise would be completely missed and raises the question of how common Virgil-like objects could be in the early Universe.

  Circumnuclear star formation (SF) is generally seen in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN); however, the connection between the AGN activity and SF in them is less well understood. To explore this connection on scales of a few tens of parsec to a few tens of kiloparsec and larger, we carried out an investigation of SF in seven Seyfert type AGN and one LINER galaxy, using observations with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board {\it AstroSat} in the near ultra-Violet (NUV; 2000-3000 \AA) and far ultra-Violet (FUV; 2000-3000 \AA) bands. A total of 1742 star-forming regions were identified, having size scales of 0.010 to 63.642 kpc$^2$. Considering all the galaxies, we found a positive correlation between their total surface density of SF ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) and extinction. For five galaxies, namely NGC 1365, NGC 4051, NGC 4321, NGC 5033 and NGC 6814, we found a gradual decrease of both extinction and $\Sigma_{SFR}$ from the centre to the outer regions. Four sources are found to lie in the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies, and the other four are away from MS. We found the ratio of the star formation rate (SFR) in the nuclear region to the total SFR to be positively correlated with the Eddington ratio. This points to the influence of AGN on enhancing the SF characteristics of the hosts. However, the impact is dominant only in the central nuclear region with no significant effect on the larger scales probed in this work.

  We combined a principal component analysis (PCA) and spectroscopy to investigate the origin of the soft excess in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564 with XMM-Newton observations over a period of ten years. We find that the principal components in different epochs are very similar, suggesting stable variability patterns in this source. More importantly, although its spectra could be equally well fitted by the two soft excess models, simulations show that the principal components from the relativistically smeared reflection model match the data well. At the same time, the principal components from the warm corona model show significant inconsistency. This finding indicates that the soft excess in Ark 564 originates from the relativistically smeared reflection, rather than the Comptonization in the warm corona, thereby favoring the reflection origin or the "hybrid" origin of the soft excess. Furthermore, the presence of the narrow absorption features in the spectra suggests that the soft excess is unlikely to originate from absorptions due to possible outflowing winds. Our results indicate that the PCA coupled with spectral analysis is a promising approach to exploring the origin of the soft excess in active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

  We present multi-frequency (5-345 GHz) and multi-resolution radio observations of 1ES 1927+654, widely considered one of the most unusual and extreme changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGN). The source was first designated a CL-AGN after an optical outburst in late 2017 and has since displayed considerable changes in X-ray emission, including the destruction and rebuilding of the X-ray corona in 2019-2020. Radio observations prior to 2023 show a faint and compact radio source not unusual for radio-quiet AGN. Starting in February 2023, 1ES 1927+654 began exhibiting a radio flare with a steep exponential rise, reaching a peak 60 times previous flux levels, and has maintained this higher level of radio emission for nearly a year. The 5-23 GHz spectrum is broadly similar to gigahertz-peaked radio sources, which are understood to be young radio jets less than ~1000 years old. Recent high-resolution VLBA observations at 23.5 GHz now show resolved extensions on either side of the core, with a separation of 0.14 pc, consistent with a new and mildly relativistic bipolar outflow. A steady increase in the soft X-ray band (0.3-2 keV) concurrent with the radio may be consistent with jet-driven shocked gas, though further observations are needed to test alternate scenarios. This source joins a growing number of CL-AGN and tidal disruption events which show late-time radio activity, years after the initial outburst.
