  Active galactic nucleus (AGN) driven outflows can have a significant impact on the evolution of the host galaxy. In this work, we compare the properties of galaxies that hosts AGNs with and without outflows. Our sample consists of 103 AGNs identified by mid-IR color-color selection, and confirmed with optical spectroscopy at a redshift range of 0.3 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 0.9. We fit the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 line using spectra from the zCOSMOS survey to identify and to study the occurrence of outflows. We find that ionized outflows are present in $\sim$25\% of our sample, with the largest incidence at the highest [OIII] and X-ray luminosity bins. The fastest outflows are found in the more extended and massive galaxies. We do not observe a difference in the star formation rate of AGNs with outflows compared to AGNs without outflows. From visual inspection and non-parametric morphological studies, we obtain that outflows are preferentially observed in galaxies with disk-type and elliptical morphologies.

  The existence of accreting supermassive black holes up to billions of solar masses at early cosmological epochs (in the context of this work, redshifts z&gt;=6) requires very fast growth rates which is challenging to explain. The presence of a relativistic jet can be a direct indication of activity and accretion status in active galactic nuclei (AGN), constraining the radiative properties of these extreme objects. However, known jetted AGN beyond z~6 are still very rare. The radio-emitting AGN J2331+1129 has recently been claimed as a candidate BL Lac object at redshift z=6.57, based on its synchrotron-dominated emission spectrum and the lack of ultraviolet/optical emission lines. It is a promising candidate for the highest-redshift blazar known to date. The aim of the observations described here was to support or refute the blazar classification of this peculiar source. We performed high-resolution radio interferometric imaging observations of J2331+1129 using the Very Long Baseline Array at 1.6 and 4.9 GHz in 2022 Feb. The images revealed a compact but slightly resolved, flat-spectrum core feature at both frequencies, indicating that the total radio emission is produced by a compact jet and originates from within a central 10-pc scale region. While these are consistent with the radio properties of a BL Lac object, the inferred brightness temperatures are at least an order of magnitude lower than expected from a Doppler-boosted radio jet, leaving the high-redshift BL Lac identification still an open question.
