  The Time Domain Field (TDF) near the North Ecliptic Pole in JWST's continuous-viewing zone will become a premier "blank field" for extragalactic science. JWST/NIRCam data in a 16 arcmin$^2$ portion of the TDF identify 4.4 $\mu$m counterparts for 62 of 63 3 GHz sources with S(3 GHz) &gt; 5 {\mu}Jy. The one unidentified radio source may be a lobe of a nearby Seyfert galaxy, or it may be an infrared-faint radio source. The bulk properties of the radio-host galaxies are consistent with those found by previous work: redshifts range from 0.14 to 4.4 with a median redshift of 1.33. The radio emission arises primarily from star formation in $\sim 2/3$ of the sample and from an active galactic nucleus in $\sim 1/3$, but just over half the sample shows evidence for an AGN either in the spectral energy distribution or by radio excess. All but three counterparts are brighter than magnitude 23 AB at 4.4 $\mu$m, and the exquisite resolution of JWST identifies correct counterparts for sources for which observations with lower angular resolution would mis-identify a nearby bright source as the counterpart when the correct one is faint and red. Up to 11% of counterparts might have been unidentified or misidentified absent NIRCam observations.

  We apply machine learning algorithms to classify Infrared (IR)-selected targets for NASA's upcoming SPHEREx mission. In particular, we are interested in classifying Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), which are essential for understanding the star formation process. Our approach differs from previous work, which has relied heavily on broadband color criteria to classify IR-bright objects, and are typically implemented in color-color and color-magnitude diagrams. However, these methods do not state the confidence associated with the classification and the results from these methods are quite ambiguous due to the overlap of different source types in these diagrams. Here, we utilize photometric colors and magnitudes from seven near and mid-infrared bands simultaneously and employ machine and deep learning algorithms to carry out probabilistic classification of YSOs, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and main-sequence (MS) stars. Our approach also sub-classifies YSOs into Class I, II, III and flat spectrum YSOs, and AGB stars into carbon-rich and oxygen-rich AGB stars. We apply our methods to infrared-selected targets compiled in preparation for SPHEREx which are likely to include YSOs and other classes of objects. Our classification indicates that out of $8,308,384$ sources, $1,966,340$ have class prediction with probability exceeding $90\%$, amongst which $\sim 1.7\%$ are YSOs, $\sim 58.2\%$ are AGB stars, $\sim 40\%$ are (reddened) MS stars, and $\sim 0.1\%$ are AGN whose red broadband colors mimic YSOs. We validate our classification using the spatial distributions of predicted YSOs towards the Cygnus-X star-forming complex, as well as AGB stars across the Galactic plane.

  VERITAS is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT) array most sensitive to gamma rays in the very-high-energy (VHE) energy band (85 GeV - 30 TeV). As a part of its active galactic nuclei (AGN) program, VERITAS focuses on the identification and follow-up of AGN flares reported by other multiwavelength observatories. Between October 15th and October 19th, 2020, VERITAS followed up on the Fermi-LAT and MAGIC detections of a flare of the intermediate-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae (IBL) object, B2 1811+31, located at a redshift of z=0.117. In this work, we present preliminary scientific results from the analysis of B2 1811+31's 2020 flare, including the corresponding Fermi-LAT light curve and VERITAS detection analysis.

  With the advancement of technology, machine learning-based analytical methods have pervaded nearly every discipline in modern studies. Particularly, a number of methods have been employed to estimate the redshift of gamma-ray loud active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are a class of supermassive black hole systems known for their intense multi-wavelength emissions and violent variability. Determining the redshifts of AGNs is essential for understanding their distances, which, in turn, sheds light on our current understanding of the structure of the nearby universe. However, the task involves a number of challenges such as the need for meticulous follow-up observations across multiple wavelengths and astronomical facilities. In this study, we employ a simple yet effective deep learning model with a single hidden layer having $64$ neurons and a dropout of 0.25 in the hidden layer, on a sample of AGNs with known redshifts from the latest AGN catalog, 4LAC-DR3, obtained from Fermi-LAT. We utilized their spectral, spatial, and temporal properties to robustly predict the redshifts of AGNs as well quantify their associated uncertainties, by modifying the model using two different variational inference methods. We achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.784 on the test set from the frequentist model and 0.777 and 0.778 from both the variants of variational inference, and, when used to make predictions on the samples with unknown redshifts, we achieve mean predictions of 0.421, 0.415 and 0.393, with standard deviations of 0.258, 0.246 and 0.207 from the models, respectively.

  We explore the relationship between the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) power spectrum amplitude and the halo mass and redshift of galaxy clusters in South Pole Telescope (SPT) data, in comparison with three $N$-body simulations combined with semi-analytical gas models of the intra-cluster medium. Specifically, we calculate both the raw and fractional power contribution to the full tSZ power spectrum amplitude at $\ell = 3000$ from clusters as a function of halo mass and redshift. We use nine mass bins in the range $1 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot\ h^{-1} &lt; M_{500} &lt; 2 \times 10^{15}\ M_\odot\ h^{-1}$, and two redshift bins defined by $0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.59$ and $0.59 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$. We additionally divide the raw power contribution in each mass bin by the number of clusters in that bin, as a metric for comparison of different gas models. At lower masses, the SPT data prefers a model that includes a mass-dependent bound gas fraction component and relatively high levels of AGN feedback, whereas at higher masses there is a preference for a model with a lower amount of feedback and a complete lack of non-thermal pressure support. The former provides the best fit to the data overall, in regards to all metrics for comparison. Still, discrepancies exist and the data notably exhibits a steep mass-dependence which all of the simulations fail to reproduce. This suggests the need for additional mass- and redshift-dependent adjustments to the gas models of each simulation, or the potential presence of contamination in the data at halo masses below the detection threshold of SPT-SZ. Furthermore, the data does not demonstrate significant redshift evolution in the per-cluster tSZ power spectrum contribution, in contrast to most model predictions.
