  We present a methodological framework for studying galaxy evolution by utilizing Graph Theory and network analysis tools. We study the evolutionary processes of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and quasars and the underlying physical processes, such as star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, through the application of Graph Theoretical analysis tools. We extract, process and analyse mid-infrared spectra of local (z &lt; 0.4) ULIRGs and quasars between 5-38 microns through internally developed Python routines, in order to generate similarity graphs, with the nodes representing ULIRGs being grouped together based on the similarity of their spectra. Additionally, we extract and compare physical features from the mid-IR spectra, such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission and silicate depth absorption features, as indicators of the presence of star-forming regions and obscuring dust, in order to understand the underlying physical mechanisms of each evolutionary stage of ULIRGs. Our analysis identifies five groups of local ULIRGs based on their mid-IR spectra, which is quite consistent with the well established fork classification diagram by providing a higher level classification. We demonstrate how graph clustering algorithms and network analysis tools can be utilized as unsupervised learning techniques for revealing direct or indirect relations between various galaxy properties and evolutionary stages, which provides an alternative methodology to previous works for classification in galaxy evolution. Additionally, our methodology compares the output of several graph clustering algorithms in order to demonstrate the best-performing Graph Theoretical tools for studying galaxy evolution.

  We present high-resolution VLT/UVES spectroscopy and a detailed analysis of the unique Broad Absorption-Line system towards the quasar SDSS J165252.67+265001.96. This system exhibits low-ionization metal absorption lines from the ground states and excited energy levels of Fe II and Mn II, and the meta-stable 2^3S excited state of He I. The extended kinematics of the absorber encompasses three main clumps with velocity offsets of -5680, -4550, and -1770 km s$^{-1}$ from the quasar emission redshift, $z=0.3509\pm0.0003$, derived from [O II] emission. Each clump shows moderate partial covering of the background continuum source, $C_f \approx [0.53; 0.24; 0.81]$. We discuss the excitation mechanisms at play in the gas, which we use to constrain the distance of the clouds from the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) as well as the density, temperature, and typical sizes of the clouds. The number density is found to be $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^4\rm cm^{-3}$ and the temperature $T_e \sim 10^4\rm\,K$, with longitudinal cloudlet sizes of $\gtrsim0.01$ pc. Cloudy photo-ionization modelling of He I$^{*}$, which is also produced at the interface between the neutral and ionized phases, assuming the number densities derived from Fe II, constrains the ionization parameter to be $\log U \sim -3$. This corresponds to distances of a few 100 pc from the AGN. We discuss these results in the more general context of associated absorption-line systems and propose a connection between FeLoBALs and the recently-identified molecular-rich intrinsic absorbers. Studies of significant samples of FeLoBALs, even though rare per se, will soon be possible thanks to large dedicated surveys paired with high-resolution spectroscopic follow-ups.
