  A quadruply lensed source, J125856.3-031944, has been discovered using the DELVE survey and WISE W1 - W2 colors. Followup direct imaging carried out with the MPIA 2.2 m and the Baade 6.5 m telescopes is analyzed, as is spectroscopy from the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope. The lensed image configuration is kite-like, with the faintest image 2 magnitudes fainter than the other three. Redward of 6000 AA that image is badly blended with the lensing galaxy, which is elongated along the symmetry axis of the kite. Magellan direct imaging carried out in Sloan g permits better deblending. As the lensed image configuration is nearly circular, simple models give individual magnifications of at least 25 for the 3 brighter images. The source's narrow emission lines and low intrinsic luminosity qualify it as a type 2 AGN.

  X-ray polarimetry has been suggested as a prominent tool for investigating the geometrical and physical properties of the emissions from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The successful launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) on 9 December 2021 has expanded the previously restricted scope of polarimetry into the X-ray domain, enabling X-ray polarimetric studies of AGN. Over a span of two years, IXPE has observed various AGN populations, including blazars and radio-quiet AGN. In this paper, we summarize the remarkable discoveries achieved thanks to the opening of the new window of X-ray polarimetry of AGN through IXPE observations. We will delve into two primary areas of interest: first, the magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration mechanisms in the jets of radio-loud AGN, such as blazars, where the relativistic acceleration process dominates the spectral energy distribution; and second, the geometry of the hot corona in radio-quiet AGN. Thus far, the IXPE results from blazars favor the energy-stratified shock acceleration model, and they provide evidence of helical magnetic fields inside the jet. Concerning the corona geometry, the IXPE results are consistent with a disk-originated slab-like or wedge-like shape, as could result from Comptonization around the accretion disk.

  In this study, we investigate the impact of local stellar radiation in cosmological zoom simulations of the formation of Milky Way-sized galaxies. We include the radiation field as an additional feedback component that is computed alongside gravity with a tree code in an optically thin approximation. We resimulate the initial conditions of five Milk Way-like systems taken from the Auriga project with and without stellar radiation, and study the effects of local stellar radiation on several properties of the galaxies and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Similar to previous findings, we observe that local stellar radiation can modify gas cooling in the circumgalactic medium and thus suppress star formation and the surface densities of young stars and HI gas, while having little impact on the total gas content. Even though the magnitude of the effect we find is smaller than reported in earlier work, the radiation field is thus clearly an important component in simulations of late time galaxies. In particular, it also suppresses the peak of the rotation curve and reduces the mass of the stellar bulge. In the CGM region, the young stellar radiation exceeds the external UVB and dominates the radiation field within the virial halo at all redshifts. Nevertheless, we find that the local stellar radiation has overall little impact on the radial density and temperature profile of the CGM gas. The metallicity profile is slightly reduced, however, as well as the HI and MgII column densities within $\sim 0.3\,R_{\rm vir}$. In contrast, we find that the OVI column density is hardly impacted by the radiation field. Additional effects can be expected from the radiation of the central AGN during phases of quasar activity, which has not yet been included in the simulations of the present study.

  Methods.We applied distinct selection criteria to attain an SFG sample with minimal AGN contamination. Multiple approaches were used to estimate the intrinsic extinction, SFR and gas-phase metallicity for the SFGs. In conjunction with findings in the literature, we examined the correlation between SFRs and stellar masses ($M_*$), as well as the metallicity evolution depending on $M_*$. Finally, the 3D relationship between $M_*$, SFR and metallicity, is also studied.} Results. From the initial spectroscopic sample of 409 FIR-selected objects from the Lockman--SpReSO catalogue, 69 (17\%) AGNs have been identified and excluded, which is nearly double the percentage found in local studies, leaving a sample of 340 SFGs. The analysis of the $M_*$--SFR relationship revealed that Lockman--SpReSO IR-selected SFGs show signs of evolution at redshifts $z&gt;0.4$, shifting above the main sequence, with a mean value of $\sim0.4$ dex. They are located within the starburst galaxy region since 78\% of the galaxies fall into this category. In addition, no evident flattening was found in the relation to specific SFR with redshift for $\log M_* (M_\odot) \gtrsim 10.5$. In line with the $M_*$--metallicity relation (MZR) outcomes published in previous studies for optically selected SFGs, however, during the analysis of the MZR, it was found that IR-selected SFGs exhibit lower metallicities than those anticipated on the basis of their $M_*$ and redshift. During the investigation of the 3D $M_*$--SFR--metallicity relation (FP), it was established that the research sample is consistent with relations in the existing literature, with an average scatter of $\sim0.2$ dex. However, a re-calibration of the FP when using the SFR obtained from the IR luminosity is required and, in this case, no attenuation in the correlation for $\log M_* (M_\odot) \gtrsim 10.5$ is observed.

  We present the study on the relationship between SMBHs and their host galaxies using our variability-selected AGN sample ($i_\mathrm{AB} \leq 25.9,\ z \leq 4.5$) constructed from the HSC-SSP Ultra-deep survey in the COSMOS field. We estimated the BH mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}=10^{5.5-10}\ M_{\odot}$) based on the single-epoch virial method and the total stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{star}=10^{10-12}\ M_{\odot}$) by separating the AGN component with SED fitting. We found that the redshift evolution of the BH-stellar mass ratio ($M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\mathrm{star}$) depends on the $M_\mathrm{BH}$ which is caused by the no significant correlation between $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and $M_\mathrm{star}$. Variable AGNs with massive SMBHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}&gt;10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$) at $1.5&lt;z&lt;3$ show considerably higher BH-stellar mass ratios ($&gt;\sim1\%$) than the BH-bulge ratios ($M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\mathrm{bulge}$) observed in the local universe for the same BH range. This implies that there is a typical growth path of massive SMBHs which is faster than the formation of the bulge component as final products seen in the present day. For the low-mass SMBHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}&lt;10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$) at $0.5&lt;z&lt;3$, on the other hand, variable AGNs show the similar BH-stellar mass ratios with the local objects ($\sim 0.1\%$) but smaller than those observed at $z &gt; 4$. We interpret that host galaxies harboring less massive SMBHs at intermediate redshift have already acquired sufficient stellar mass, although high-z galaxies are still in the early stage of galaxy formation relative to those at the intermediate/local universe.   

Stacking X-ray Observations of "Little Red Dots": Implications for their
  AGN Properties

  Recent {\em James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)} observations have revealed a population of compact extragalactic objects at $z\gtrsim4$ with red near-infrared colors, which have been dubbed as ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). The spectroscopically-selected LRDs exhibit broad H$\alpha$ emission lines, which has led to the conclusion that type-I active galactic nuclei (AGN) are harbored in the galaxies' dust-reddened cores. However, other mechanisms, like strong outflowing winds, could also produce broad H$\alpha$ emission lines, and thus, the nature of LRDs is still under debate. In this work, we test the AGN hypothesis for LRDs by stacking the archival {\em Chandra} observations of 19 spectroscopically-selected LRDs. We obtain non-detections in both the soft $(0.5-2\text{ keV})$ and the hard $(2-8\text{ keV})$ X-ray band after stacking, and put upper limits on the X-ray luminosities of these LRDs. We find that the soft band upper limit is $\sim1$ dex lower than the expected level from the $L_\text{X}-L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ relation, while the hard band upper limit is consistent with this relation. This result suggests that LRDs and typical type-I AGNs have significantly different properties. We consider it unlikely that absorption is the main reason for the observed low $L_\text{X}/L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ ratios of LRDs. Alternatively, we discuss two plausible hypotheses: (1) LRDs have intrinsically weak X-ray emissions, (2) fast, galactic-scale outflows have a major contribution to the observed broad H$\alpha$ lines. Our findings indicate that empirical relations (e.g., for black hole mass measurements) established for typical type-I AGNs should be used with caution when analyzing the properties of LRDs.
