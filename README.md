  Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGN) have been observed to change optical spectral type. Mrk 1018 is unique: first classified as a type 1.9 Seyfert galaxy, it transitioned to a type 1 before returning to its initial classification after approximately 30 years. We present a high-cadence monitoring programme that caught a major outburst in 2020. Due to sunblock, only the decline could be observed. We studied X-ray, UV, optical, and IR before and after the outburst to investigate the responses of the AGN structures. We derived a u'-band light curve of the AGN contribution alone. The flux increased by a factor of the order of 13. We confirmed this in other optical bands and determined the shape and speed of the decline in each waveband. The shapes of H beta and H alpha were analysed before and after the event. Two XMM-Newton observations from before and after the outburst were also exploited. The outburst is asymmetric, with a swifter rise than decline. The decline is best fit by a linear function, ruling out a tidal disruption event. The optical spectrum shows no change approximately 8 months before and 17 months after. The UV flux increased slightly after the outburst but the X-ray primary flux is unchanged. However, the 6.4 keV Iron line has doubled in strength. IR data taken 13 days after the observed optical peak show an increased emission level. Calculating the distance of the broad-line region and inner edge of the torus from the supermassive black hole can explain the multi-wavelength response to the outburst, in particular: i) the unchanged H beta and H alpha lines, ii) the unchanged primary X-ray spectral components, iii) the rapid and extended infrared response, as well as iv) the enhanced emission of the reflected 6.4 keV line. The outburst was due to a dramatic and short-lasting change in the intrinsic accretion rate. We discuss different models as potential causes.

  We report the discovery of the ``mm fundamental plane of black-hole accretion'', which is a tight correlation between the nuclear 1 mm luminosity ($L_{\rm \nu, mm}$), the $2$ -- $10$~keV X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X,2-10}$) and the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) with an intrinsic scatter ($\sigma_{\rm int}$) of $0.40$ dex. The plane is found for a sample of 48 nearby galaxies, most of which are radiatively-inefficient, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN). Combining these sources with a sample of high-luminosity (quasar-like) nearby AGN, we find that the plane still holds. We also find that $M_{\rm BH}$ correlates with $L_{\rm \nu, mm}$ at a highly significant level, although such correlation is less tight than the mm fundamental plane ($\sigma_{\rm int}=0.51$ dex). Crucially, we show that spectral energy distribution (SED) models for both advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and compact jets can explain the existence of these relations, which are not reproduced by the standard torus-thin accretion disc models usually associated to quasar-like AGN. The ADAF models reproduces the observed relations somewhat better than those for compact jets, although neither provides a perfect prediction. Our findings thus suggest that radiatively-inefficient accretion processes such as those in ADAFs or compact (and thus likely young) jets may play a key role in both low- and high-luminosity AGN. This mm fundamental plane also offers a new, rapid method to (indirectly) estimate SMBH masses.

  Black hole driven outflows in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) may interact with their interstellar medium (ISM) affecting star formation. Such feedback processes, reminiscent of those seen in massive galaxies, have been reported recently in some dwarf galaxies. However, such studies have usually been on kiloparsec and larger scales and our knowledge on the smallest spatial scales to which this feedback process can operate is unclear. Here we demonstrate radio jet-ISM interaction on the scale of an asymmetric triple radio structure of $\sim$10 parsec size in NGC 4395. This triplet radio structure is seen in the 15 GHz continuum image and the two asymmetric jet like structures are situated on either side of the radio core that coincides with the optical {\it Gaia} position. The high resolution radio image and the extended [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission, indicative of an outflow, are spatially coincident and are consistent with the interpretation of a low power radio jet interacting with the ISM. Modelling of the spectral lines using CLOUDY and MAPPINGS, and estimation of temperature using Gemini and MaNGA integral field spectroscopic data suggest shock ionization of the gas. The continuum emission at 237 GHz, though weak was found to spatially coincide with the AGN, however, the CO(2-1) line emission was found to be displaced by around 1 arcsec northward of the AGN core. The spatial coincidence of molecular H2$\lambda$2.4085 along the jet direction, the morphology of ionised [OIII]$\lambda$5007 and displacement of CO(2-1) emission argues for conditions less favourable for star formation at $\sim$5 parsec.
