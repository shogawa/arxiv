We investigate the presence and origin of neutral gas outflows and inflows in 13 post-starburst (PSB) and quiescent galaxies at redshifts 1.8 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 4.6, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the EXCELS survey. NaD absorption profiles reveal that 3 out of 13 exhibit blueshifted absorption indicative of outflows, and a further 2 objects show signs of inflowing gas. Outflow velocities range from $\approx$ 300 - 1200 kms$^{-1}$, and we find gas flows are detected exclusively in objects that quenched $\lt$ 600 Myr ago. This result holds when we include comparable objects from recent literature. We derive mass outflow rates over two orders of magnitude higher than current levels of star formation in our sample, indicating that the winds are unlikely to be driven by supernovae, and likely play a significant role in keeping the galaxies quenched. The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded. We then compare with the EAGLE simulation to explore a potential 'outflow cycle', finding that our observations are consistent with a model in which z $\sim$ 3 quiescent galaxies undergo short $\simeq$ 5 Myr periods of AGN activity strong enough to drive outflows, which occur every $\simeq$ 40 Myr on average. This AGN activity drives observable outflows that persist for up to $\simeq$ 10 Myr after the AGN fades, followed by a $\simeq$ 20 Myr lull, and a subsequent short inflow, which eventually re-ignites AGN activity, and the cycle repeats.

Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC~1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($&lt;1\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.

AGN hosting water megamaser disks enable exceptionally precise geometric determinations of Black Hole (BH) mass, distance, inclination, and dynamical center. In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond Sgr~A* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC~4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\sim$10~mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC~4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\lesssim 100$~Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC~4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.

IceCube observations point to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as promising contributors to the observed astrophysical neutrino flux. Close to the central black hole, protons can be accelerated through magnetic reconnection to very high energies and subsequently interact with abundant X-ray photons in the source, leading to neutrino production. We investigate whether the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can originate, via proton acceleration, in reconnection-powered coronae of non-jetted AGN. We create a library of neutrino spectral templates, over a large grid of values for the three key model parameters: the proton plasma magnetization of the corona $σ_{\rm p}$, the X-ray coronal luminosity, and the black hole mass. Synchrotron cooling of pions and muons plays a significant role due to the large coronal magnetic fields. We couple the single-source model with a mock AGN catalog, consistent with the observed X-ray and mid-infrared AGN samples at redshifts $z=0-4$, to infer the diffuse neutrino flux. Coronal emission satisfactorily explains the most recent IceCube measurements of the diffuse neutrino flux up to energies of $\sim 1$~PeV, provided that $\sim$10\% of the AGN coronae have $σ_{\rm p} \sim 10^5$, while the rest are distributed over a range of lower magnetizations. Coronal emission is suppressed at higher energies by pion and muon cooling, so that another population is required, with jetted AGN being strong candidates.

Light curves represent astronomical time series of flux measured across one or more photometric bands. With the rapid growth of large-scale sky surveys, time-domain astronomy has become an essential area of modern astrophysical research. Interactive visualization of extensive light-curve datasets plays a key role in exploring transient phenomena and in planning large follow-up campaigns. In this work, we introduce two web-based platforms designed for interactive light-curve visualization: Fulu, for transient event studies, and VALC, for investigations of low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These tools provide a user-friendly interface for examining, comparing, and interpreting vast collections of astronomical light curves, supporting scientific discovery.

Massive quenched galaxies at z&gt;3 challenge models of early galaxy evolution, as their rapid formation and abrupt quenching require efficient feedback, often linked to active galactic nuclei (AGN). The quiescent galaxy GS10578 at z=3.1 is a key example of this population. Previous JWST/NIRSpec IFU data revealed an AGN outflow and uncovered a compact pair of AGN separated by ~5 kpc. In addition, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy has identified a third AGN candidate at a projected distance of ~30 kpc, associated with a luminous Lya emitter (LAE2) characterised by high-ionisation UV lines, although rest-frame optical diagnostics were not previously available. We aim to confirm the nature of LAE2 using rest-frame optical diagnostics enabled by new JWST data, and to characterise the physical and ionisation properties of both LAE2 and a distinct nearby Lya emitter (LAE1) that lacks any detectable continuum counterpart. We analyse new NIRSpec IFU observations targeting the optical nebular lines of LAE1 and LAE2, complemented with MUSE data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We extract integrated and spatially resolved spectra, construct emission-line maps, and use standard diagnostic diagrams to determine ionisation sources and kinematics. LAE2 exhibits line ratios fully consistent with an embedded AGN. Its optical lines display a clumpy morphology and irregular kinematics on sub-kpc scales. Except for Lya, LAE1 remains undetected in all nebular lines and in JWST imaging. The similarity of the LAE1 and LAE2 Lya profiles in both velocity and flux suggests that LAE1 traces resonantly scattered emission rather than in-situ star formation. Our analysis reveals that the environment of GS10578 contains both multi-black-hole activity and gas structures on tens-of-kpc scales, offering new insights into how feedback and satellite interactions influence the late evolutionary stages of quenched massive galaxies.
