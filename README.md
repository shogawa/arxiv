  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are extremely variable in the X-ray band down to very short time scales. However, the driver of the X-ray variability is still poorly understood. Previous results suggest that the hot corona, which is responsible for the primary Comptonized emission observed in AGN, should have an important role in driving the X-ray variability. In this work, we investigate the connection between the X-ray amplitude variability and the coronal physical parameters, namely the temperature ($kT$) and optical depth ($\tau$). We present the spectral and timing analysis of 46 NuSTAR observations corresponding to a sample of 20 AGN. For each source we derive the coronal temperature and optical depth through X-ray spectroscopy, and we compute the normalized excess variance for different energy bands at a time scale of $10$ ks. We find a strong inverse correlation between $kT$ and $\tau$, with correlation coefficient $r&lt;-0.9$ and negligible null probability. No clear dependence between the temperature and physical properties such as the black hole mass and the Eddington ratio is found. We also find that the observed X-ray variability does not correlate with either the coronal temperature or optical depth under the thermal equilibrium assumption, while it is anti-correlated with the black hole mass. These results can be interpreted in a scenario where one possibility is that the observed X-ray variability could be mainly driven by variations in coronal physical properties on a time scale of less than $10$ ks, whereas we assume thermal equilibrium at such time scales in this paper, given the capability of the currently available hard X-ray telescopes. However, it is also possible that the X-ray variability is mostly driven by the absolute size of the corona, which depends on the supermassive black hole mass, rather than by its physical properties.   

Connecting the radio AGN life cycle to feedback: Ionised gas is more

  In the host galaxies of radio AGN, kinematically disturbed gas due to jet-driven feedback is a widely observed phenomenon. Simulations predict that the impact of jets on the surrounding gas changes as they grow. Useful insights into this phenomenon can be obtained by characterising radio AGN into different evolutionary stages and studying their impact on gas kinematics. We present a systematic study of the [OIII] gas kinematics for a sample of 5720 radio AGN up to $z\sim0.8$ with a large 1.4 GHz luminosity range of $\approx10^{22.5}-10^{28}$W/Hz, and 1693 [OIII] detections. Taking advantage of the wide frequency coverage of LOFAR and VLA surveys from $144-3000$MHz, we determine the radio spectral shapes, using them to characterise sources into different stages of the radio AGN life cycle. We determine the [OIII] kinematics from SDSS spectra and link it to the life cycle. Our main conclusion is that the [OIII] gas is $\sim$3 times more likely to be disturbed in the peaked spectrum (PS) sources (that represent a young phase of activity) than non-peaked spectrum (NPS) sources (that represent more evolved sources) at $z&lt;0.4$. This changes to a factor of $\sim$2 at $z&gt;0.4$. This shows that on average, the strong impact of jets is limited to the initial stages of the radio AGN life cycle. At later stages, the impact on gas is more gentle. We also determine the dependence of this trend on 1.4GHz and [OIII] luminosities and find that the difference between the two groups increases with 1.4GHz luminosity. Young radio AGN with $L_\mathrm{1.4GHz}&gt;10^{25}$W/Hz have the most extreme impact on [OIII]. Using a stacking analysis, we are further able to trace the changing impact on [OIII] in the high-frequency peaked spectrum (i.e. youngest), low-frequency peaked spectrum ("less young"), and non-peaked spectrum (evolved) radio AGN.
