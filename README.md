  We present a search for luminous, long-duration ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs) similar to the unprecedented discovery of the extreme, ambiguous event AT2021lwx with a $&gt;150$ d rise time and luminosity $10^{45.7}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We use the Lasair transient broker to search Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data for transients lasting more than one year and exhibiting smooth declines. Our search returns 59 events, seven of which we classify as ANTs assumed to be driven by accretion onto supermassive black holes. We propose the remaining 52 are stochastic variability from regular supermassive black hole accretion rather than distinct transients. We supplement the seven ANTs with three nuclear transients in ZTF that fail the light curve selection but have clear single flares and spectra that do not resemble typical AGN. All but one of these 10 ANTs have a mid-infrared flare from an assumed dust echo, implying the ubiquity of dust around the black holes giving rise to ANTs. No events are more luminous than AT2021lwx, but one (ZTF19aamrjar) has twice the duration and a higher integrated energy release. On the other extreme, ZTF20abodaps reaches a luminosity close to AT2021lwx with a rise time $&lt;20$ d and that fades smoothly in $&gt;600$ d. We define a portion of rise-time versus flare amplitude space that selects ANTs with $\sim50$ per cent purity against variable active galactic nuclei. We calculate a volumetric rate of $\gtrsim 3\times10^{-11}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the events being caused by tidal disruptions of intermediate and high-mass stars.

  3C 275.1 is a blue quasar at $z=0.55522$, hosting powerful outflows and residing in a complex environment. We present a serendipitously detected giant nebula surrounding 3C 275.1, which shows morphological features resembling those of objects known as "jellyfish galaxy", with extremely long tails of ionized gas extending to 170 kpc in projection. We analyze its optical spectra taken by the MUSE on the VLT. The brighter part of this giant nebula exceeds 100 kpc, whose rotation curve does not flatten out, is very different from those of normal spiral galaxies. This system shares some characteristics common to those formed via ram pressure stripping (RPS), yet its long narrow tails and higher ionization are unusual compared to known tails in jellyfish galaxies, not fully consistent with a simple RPS scenario. Our photoionization simulation and the inferred short recombination timescale both suggest that besides the quasar 3C 275.1, an extra source of ionization is necessary to keep the gas ionized at such distance from the nucleus, which could be related to RPS, tidal interaction or AGN outflow, providing new evidence of active dynamical interaction of a galaxy with the intracluster medium.

  We use a sample of 64 nearby (D=7-45 Mpc) disk galaxies including 45 AGN and 19 non-AGN, that have high spatial resolution multiline CO observations obtained with the ALMA and/or PdBI arrays to study the distribution of cold molecular gas in their circumunuclear disks (CND). We analyze whether the concentration of cold molecular gas changes as a function of the X-ray luminosity in the 2-10 keV range ($L_{\rm X}$). We also study the concentration of the hot molecular gas using NIR data obtained for the H2 1-0S(1) line. We find a turnover in the distribution of the cold molecular gas concentration as a function of $L_{\rm X}$ with a breakpoint which divides the sample into two branches: the AGN build-up branch ($L_{\rm X}\leq10^{41.5\pm0.3}$erg/s) and the AGN feedback branch ($L_{\rm X}\geq10^{41.5\pm0.3}$erg/s) . Lower luminosity AGN and non-AGN of the AGN build-up branch show high cold molecular gas concentrations and centrally peaked radial profiles on nuclear ($r\leq50$~pc) scales. Higher luminosity AGN of the AGN feedback branch, show a sharp decrease in the concentration of molecular gas and flat or inverted radial profiles. The cold molecular gas concentration index ($CCI$), defined as the ratio of surface densities at $r\leq50$~pc and $r\leq200$~pc , namely $CCI \equiv$~log$_{\rm 10}(\Sigma^{\rm gas}_{\rm 50}/\Sigma^{\rm gas}_{\rm 200}$), spans a factor ~4-5 between the galaxies lying at the high end of the AGN build-up branch and the galaxies of the AGN feedback branch. The concentration and radial distributions of the hot molecular gas in our sample follow less extreme trends as a function of the X-ray luminosity. These observations confirm, on a three times larger sample, previous evidence found by the GATOS survey that the imprint of AGN feedback on the CND-scale distribution of molecular gas is more extreme in higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies of the local universe.

  We report here our comparative analysis of active galactic nucleus (AGN) and star formation (SF) characteristics of a sample of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) and broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLS1) galaxies. Our sample consisted of 373 BLS1 and 240 NLS1 galaxies spanning the redshift 0.02 to 0.8. The broad-band spectral energy distribution, constructed using data from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared, was modelled using CIGALE to derive the basic properties of our sample. We searched for differences in stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and AGN luminosity in the two populations. We also estimated new radiation-pressure corrected black hole masses for our sample of BLS1 and NLS1 galaxies. While the virial black hole mass (MBH) of BLS1 galaxies is similar to their radiation-pressure corrected MBH values, the virial MBH values of NLS1 galaxies are underestimated. We found that NLS1 galaxies have a lower MBH of log (MBH) = 7.45 +/- 0.27 and a higher log (Eddington ratio) of -0.72 +/- 0.22 than BLS1 galaxies, which have log (MBH) and log (Eddington ratio) of 8.04 +/- 0.26 and -1.08 +/- 0.24, respectively. The distributions of stellar mass, SFR, and specific star formation (sSFR = SFR/stellar mass) for the two populations are indistinguishable. This analysis is based on an independent approach and contradicts reports in the literature that NLS1 galaxies have a higher SF than BLS1 galaxies. While we found that AGN luminosity increases with stellar mass, luminosity of SF flattens at high stellar mass for both BLS1 and NLS1 galaxies. The reason may be that SF is suppressed by AGN feedback at stellar mass higher than 10^11 solar mass or that the AGN fuelling mechanism is decoupled from SF. Separating the sample into radio-detected and radio-undetected subsamples, we found no difference in their SF properties suggesting that the effect of AGN jets on SF is negligible.   

Propagation of GRB Relativistic Jets in AGN Disks and Its Implication

  The accretion disks of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) harboring in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are considered to be an ideal site for producing different types of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The detectability of these GRB phenomena hidden in AGN disks is highly dependent on the dynamical evolution of the GRB relativistic jets. By investigating the reverse and forward shock dynamics due to the interaction between the jets and AGN disk material, we find that the relativistic jets can successfully break out from the disks only for a sufficiently high luminosity and a long enough duration. In comparison, relatively normal GRB jets are inclined to be choked in the disks, unless the GRBs occur near an SMBH with relatively low mass (e.g., $\sim 10^6M_{\odot}$). For the choked jets, unlike normal GRB prompt and afterglow emission, we can only expect to detect emission from the forward shock when the shock is very close to the edge of the disks, i.e., the shock breakout emission and subsequent cooling of the shock.

  JWST has revealed a population of compact and extremely red galaxies at $z&gt;4$, which likely host active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present a sample of 434 ``little red dots'' (LRDs), selected from the 0.54 deg$^2$ COSMOS-Web survey. We fit galaxy and AGN SED models to derive redshifts and physical properties; the sample spans $z\sim5$-$9$ after removing brown dwarf contaminants. We consider two extreme physical scenarios: either LRDs are all AGN, and their continuum emission is dominated by the accretion disk, or they are all compact star-forming galaxies, and their continuum is dominated by stars. If LRDs are AGN-dominated, our sample exhibits bolometric luminosities $\sim10^{45-47}$ erg\,s$^{-1}$, spanning the gap between JWST AGN in the literature and bright, rare quasars. We derive a bolometric luminosity function (LF) $\sim100$ times the (UV-selected) quasar LF, implying a non-evolving black hole accretion density of $\sim10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ from $z\sim2$-$9$. By contrast, if LRDs are dominated by star formation, we derive stellar masses $\sim10^{8.5-10}\,M_\odot$. MIRI/F770W is key to deriving accurate stellar masses; without it, we derive a mass function inconsistent with $\Lambda$CDM. The median stellar mass profile is broadly consistent with the maximal stellar mass surface densities seen in the nearby universe, though the most massive $\sim50$\% of objects exceed this limit, requiring substantial AGN contribution to the continuum. Nevertheless, stacking all available X-ray, mid-IR, far-IR/sub-mm, and radio data yields non-detections. Whether dominated by dusty AGN, compact star-formation, or both, the high masses/luminosities and remarkable abundance of LRDs implies a dominant mode of early galaxy/SMBH growth.

  JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at $z &gt; 4$, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their spectral energy distributions can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes eight LRDs from the CEERS survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) at 0.53 $\mu m$ rest-frame. We find that the SEDs of all the LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with the best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 40% and 85%. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies -- by $\sim 2$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases -- compared to the local $M_{\bullet} - M_{\star}$ relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-$z$ Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.
