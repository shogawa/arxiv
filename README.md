  It has been suggested that merging black hole (BH) binaries in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs formed through two-body scatterings via the gas-capture process may explain a significant fraction of BH mergers in AGN and a non-negligible contribution to the observed rate from LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of BH and binary BH formation, evolution and mergers across the observed AGN mass function using a novel physically motivated treatment for the gas-capture process derived from hydrodynamical simulations of BH-BH encounters in AGN and varying assumptions on the AGN disc physics. The results suggest that gas-captured binaries could result in merger rates of 0.73 - 7.1Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. Most mergers take place near the outer boundary of the accretion disk, but this may be subject to change when migration is considered. The BH merger rate in the AGN channel in the Universe is dominated by AGN with supermassive BH masses on the order of 10$^{7} M_\odot$ , with 90% of mergers occurring in the range 10$^{6} M_\odot$ - 10$^{8} M_\odot$ . The merging mass distribution is flatter than the initial BH mass power law by a factor $\Delta \xi$ = 1.1 to 1.2, as larger BHs can align with the disc and successfully form binaries more efficiently. Similarly, the merging mass ratio distribution is flatter, therefore the AGN channel could easily explain the high mass and unequal mass ratio detections such as GW190521 and GW190814. When modelling the BH binary formation process using a simpler dynamical friction treatment, we observe very similar results, where the primary bottleneck is the alignment time with the disk. We find the most influential parameters on the rates are the anticipated number of BHs and their mass function. We conclude that AGN remain an important channel for consideration, particularly for gravitational wave detections involving one or two high mass BHs.

  We measure the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the third-year release of the Dark Energy Survey, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) maps from Planck, and X-ray maps from ROSAT. We investigate the possibility of developing a physical model able to jointly describe both measurements, simultaneously constraining the spatial distribution and thermodynamic properties of hot gas. We find that a relatively simple model is able to describe both sets of measurements and to make reasonably accurate predictions for other observables (the tSZ auto-correlation, its cross-correlation with X-rays, and tomographic measurements of the bias-weighted mean gas pressure). We show, however, that contamination from X-ray AGN, as well as the impact of non-thermal pressure support, must be incorporated in order to fully resolve tensions in parameter space between different data combinations. We obtain simultaneous constraints on the mass scale at which half of the gas content has been expelled from the halo, $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_c)=14.83^{+0.16}_{-0.23}$, on the polytropic index of the gas, $\Gamma=1.144^{+0.016}_{-0.013}$, and on the ratio of the central gas temperature to the virial temperature $\alpha_T=1.30^{+0.15}_{-0.28}$.

  We present a detailed investigation into the abundance and morphology of high redshift quenched galaxies at $3 &lt; z &lt; 7$ using James Webb Space Telescope data in the NEP, CEERS and JADES fields. Within these fields, we identify 90 candidate passive galaxies using specific star formation rates modelled with the BAGPIPES SED fitting code, which is more effective at identifying recently quenched systems than the classical UVJ method. With this sample of galaxies, we find number densities broadly consistent with other works and a rapidly evolving passive fraction of high mass galaxies ($\log_{10}{(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})} &gt; $ 9.5) between $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$. We find that the fraction of galaxies with low star formation rates and mass 9.5 $ &lt; \log_{10}{(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})} &lt; $ 10.5 decreases from $\sim$25% at $3 &lt; z &lt; 4$ to $\sim$2% at $5 &lt; z &lt; 7$. Our passive sample of galaxies is shown to exhibit more compact light profiles compared to star-forming counterparts and some exhibit traces of AGN activity through detections in either the X-ray or radio. At the highest redshifts ($z &gt; 6.5$) passive selections start to include examples of 'little red dots' which complicates any conclusions until their nature is better understood.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powerful sources of panchromatic radiation. All AGN emit in X-rays, contributing around $\sim 5-10\%$ of the AGN bolometric luminosity. The X-ray emitting region, popularly known as the corona, is geometrically and radiatively compact with a size typically $\lesssim 10 \, R_{\rm G}$ (gravitational radii). The rapid and extreme variability in X-rays also suggest that the corona must be a dynamic structure. Decades of X-ray studies have shed much light on the topic, but the nature and origin of AGN corona are still not clearly understood. This is mostly due to the complexities involved in several physical processes at play in the high-gravity, high-density and high-temperature region in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). It is still not clear how exactly the corona is energetically and physically sustained near a SMBH. Since corona is ubiquitously found in AGN, is there something fundamental about the accretion process that produces it? In this review we discuss the X-ray observational properties of the corona in radio quiet AGN.

  A core sample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs with simultaneous XMM-Newton X-ray and UV observations is compiled from archive to probe the nature of soft X-ray excess (SE). In the first paper of this series, our focus centers on scrutinizing the spectral profile of the soft excess. Of the sources, $\approx$ 71% (42/59) exhibit powerlaw-like (po-like) soft excess, while $\approx$ 29% (17/59) exhibit blackbody-like (bb-like) soft excess. We show a cut-off powerlaw could uniformly characterize both types of soft excesses, with median Ecut of 1.40 keV for po-like and 0.14 keV for bb-like. For the first time, we report a robust and quantitative correlation between the SE profile and SE strength (the ratio of SE luminosity to that of the primary powerlaw continuum in 0.5 - 2.0 keV), indicating that stronger soft excess is more likely to be po-like, or effectively has a higher Ecut. This correlation cannot be explained by ionized disk reflection alone, which produces mostly bb-like soft excess (Ecut $\sim$ 0.1 keV) as revealed by relxilllp simulation. Remarkably, we show with simulations that a toy hybrid scenario, where both ionized disk reflection (relxilllp, with all reflection parameters fixed at default values except for ionization of the disk) and warm corona (compTT, with temperature fixed at 1 keV) contribute to the observed soft excess, can successfully reproduce the observed correlation. This highlights the ubiquitous hybrid nature of the soft X-ray excess in AGNs, and underscores the importance of considering both components while fitting the spectra of soft excess.   

Ultra Diffuse Dwarf Galaxies Hosting Pseudo-bulges

  By analyzing data from DESI Legacy Imaging Survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey, we have identified five ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) featuring central pseudo-bulges. These UDGs display blue pseudo-bulges with S\'ersic indices $n&lt;2.5$ and effective radii spanning 300-700 pc, along with bluer thin stellar disks exhibiting low surface brightness and expansive effective radii that align with the UDG definition. The rotation velocities of these UDGs, determined using HI line widths and optical inclinations, exceed those of most dwarf galaxies of similar mass, suggesting the high halo spins or substantial dark matter halos. We propose that these UDGs likely formed through mergers of dwarf galaxies lacking old stars in their progenitors, resulting in the development of central bulge-like structures during starbursts triggered by the mergers, while also enhancing their halo spin. Subsequent gas accretion facilitated the formation of extended stellar disks. It is also worth noting the possibility that these UDGs could alternatively represent ``failed $L^{\star}$ galaxies'' with massive dark matter halos but reduced star formation efficiencies. If future high-resolution HI observations confirm the presence of massive halos around these UDGs, they may have formed due to intense AGN feedback in the early universe, and may be the descendants of ``little red dots'' observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by heightened central black hole masses and intensified accretion and feedback processes in the early universe.
