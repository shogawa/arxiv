  We report the detection of continuum excess in the rest-frame UV between 3000 {\AA} and 3550 {\AA} in the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, a galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 10.603. The shape of the continuum excess resembles a Balmer continuum but has a break around 3546 {\AA} in the rest frame, which is 100 {\AA} bluewards to the Balmer limit at 3646 {\AA}. A Balmer continuum model alone cannot fit the spectrum, implying a different origin for the continuum excess. The absence of the Balmer jump indicates an electron temperature of $\sim 3\times 10^4$ K, which is significantly higher than the temperature of $T_{e}({\rm O^{2+}}) \approx 1.3\times 10^{4}$ K inferred from [OIII]$\lambda 4363$. The temperature difference must result from mixing of different ionized regions: the Balmer emission mainly arises from dense and hot clouds in the Broad Line Region, close to the accreting black hole, whereas the forbidden lines originate from less dense and colder gas in the host galaxy (although these ionized regions are kinematically similar in GN-z11 due to its small BH mass). We propose a potential explanation for the observed continuum excess to come from a complex of FeII emission, which shows a characteristic jump bluewards to the Balmer limit as previously seen in the spectra of many lower-redshift quasars. Through comparisons with Cloudy models, we show an Fe abundance or an overall metallicity above $\sim 1/3$ solar is likely needed. Besides the FeII emission, part of the small blue bump might also be associated with an OIII Bowen fluorescent line, a line often enhanced in dense AGN-ionized gas. Finally, the spectrum provides further evidence against Wolf-Rayet or massive stars dominating the nebular emission in GN-z11.

  We present a model of radio continuum emission associated with star formation (SF) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) implemented in the Shark semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. SF emission includes free-free and synchrotron emission, which depend on the free-electron density and the rate of core-collapse supernovae with a minor contribution from supernova remnants, respectively. AGN emission is modelled based on the jet production rate, which depends on the black hole mass, accretion rate and spin, and includes synchrotron self-absorption. Shark reproduces radio luminosity functions (RLFs) at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz for 0 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 4, and scaling relations between radio luminosity, star formation rate and infrared luminosity of galaxies in the local and distant universe in good agreement with observations. The model also reproduces observed number counts of radio sources from 150 MHz to 8.4 GHz to within a factor of two on average, though larger discrepancies are seen at the very bright fluxes at higher frequencies. We use this model to understand how the radio continuum emission from radio-quiet AGNs can affect the measured RLFs of galaxies. We find current methods to exclude AGNs from observational samples result in large fractions of radio-quiet AGNs contaminating the "star-forming galaxies" selection and a brighter end to the resulting RLFs. We investigate how this effects the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) and show that AGN contamination can lead to evolution of the IRRC with redshift. Without this contamination our model predicts a redshift- and stellar mass-independent IRRC, except at the dwarf-galaxy regime.

  Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a surprisingly abundant population of faint, dusty active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z~4-7. Together with the presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at z&gt;6, this raises questions about the formation and growth histories of early black holes. Current theories for the formation of seed black holes from the death of the first stars (i.e. light seeds) and/or the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds (i.e. heavy seeds) still lack observational confirmation. Here, we present LID-568, a low-mass (7.2e6Msun) black hole hosting powerful outflows that is observed in an extreme phase of rapid growth at z~4. This object is similar to other JWST-discovered faint AGN populations, but is bright in X-ray emission and accreting at more than 4000% of the limit at which radiation pressure exceeds the force of gravitational attraction of the black hole (i.e. super-Eddington accretion). Analysis of JWST NIRSpec/IFU data reveals spatially extended Ha emission with velocities of ~ -600 - -500 km/s relative to the central black hole, indicative of robust nuclear-driven outflows. LID-568 represents an elusive low-mass black hole experiencing super-Eddington accretion as invoked by models of early black hole formation. This discovery showcases a previously undiscovered key parameter space and offers crucial insights into rapid black hole growth mechanisms in the early universe.

  novel spatial correlation analysis

  The primary formation channel for the stellar-mass Binary Black Holes which have been detected merging by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration is yet to be discerned. One of the main obstacles is that such Gravitational Wave (GW) events are not in general expected to produce an Electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. This might not be the case if the mergers happen in gaseous environments, such as the accretion discs of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Recently, 20 AGN flares detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility have been investigated as potential counterparts of GW events by Graham et al. (2023). We present a new spatial correlation analysis involving such events that uses the up-to-date posterior samples of 78 mergers detected during the third observing run of the LVK collaboration. We apply a likelihood method which takes into account the exact position of the EM signal within the 3D sky map of the GW events. We find that current data favour the hypothesis of no causal connection between the detected mergers and the AGN flares. We place an upper limit of 0.155 at a 90 per cent credibility level on the fraction of coalescences that are physically related to a flare. Moreover, we show that the mass distribution of the merging binaries that appear in coincidence with AGN flares, characterised by values typically larger than the ones of the full population of GW events, is also consistent with the no-connection hypothesis. This is because of a positive correlation between the binary mass and the reconstruction volume.   

Is the James Webb Space Telescope detecting too many AGN candidates?

  In less than two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already accelerated significantly our quest to identify active massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years of the Universe's history. At the time of writing, about 50 AGN detections and candidates have been identified through spectroscopy, photometry, and/or morphology. Broad-line AGN are about a hundred times more numerous than the faint end of the UV-bright quasar population at z~5-6. In this paper, we compare the observational constraints on the abundance of these AGN at z~5 to the populations of AGN produced in large-scale cosmological simulations. Assuming a null fraction of obscured simulated AGN, we find that while some simulations produce more AGN than discovered so far, some others produce a similar abundance or even fewer AGN in the bolometric luminosity range probed by JWST. Keeping in mind the large uncertainty on the constraints, we discuss the implications for the theoretical modeling of BH formation and evolution in case similar constraints continue to accumulate. At the redshift of interest, the simulated AGN populations diverge the most at Lbol~1e44 erg/s (by more than a dex in the bolometric luminosity function). This regime is most affected by incompleteness in JWST surveys. However, it holds significant potential for constraining the physical processes determining the assembly of BHs (e.g., seeding, feedback from supernova and AGN) and the current abundance of broad-line AGN with &gt;1e44.5 erg/s.

  Feedback is the key physical mechanism regulating galaxy formation. Stars in galaxies form when baryons radiatively cool down and fall into gravitational wells. Eventually, star formation quenches as gas is depleted and/or perturbed by feedback processes, no longer being able to collapse and condense. For massive galaxies, astronomers identify feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (active galactic nuclei, AGN) as the main agent responsible for quenching. We report the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of a massive, completely quiescent galaxy at $z=3.714$ (Jekyll) and its neighborhood. Jekyll is part of a galaxy pair with a compact, dusty, massive star-forming companion (Hyde). We find large amounts of ionized and neutral gas in the intergalactic medium around the pair, yet Jekyll has remained quiescent for more than 500~Myr. The emitting gas is consistent with AGN photoionization, but no AGN is observed in Jekyll. We find that, in contrast to standard scenarios, AGN in satellite galaxies can be critical contributors for keeping massive galaxies quiescent in the early Universe. After the accelerated formation and quenching of the massive central galaxy, tidally induced gas stripping additionally contributes to the star-formation regulation on subsequent satellite galaxy generations.
