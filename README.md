  Our aim is to understand how the interplay between AGN feedback and merge processes can effectively turn cool-core galaxy clusters into hot-core clusters in the modern universe. Additionally, we also aim to clarify which parameters of the AGN feedback model used in simulations can cause an excess of feedback at the scale of galaxy groups while not efficiently suppressing star formation at the scale of galaxy clusters. To obtain robust statistics of the cool-core population, we compare the modern Universe snapshot (z=0.25) of the largest Magneticum simulation (Box2b/hr) with the eROSITA eFEDS survey and Planck SZ-selected clusters observed with XMM-Newton. Additionally, we compare the AGN feedback injected by the simulation in radio mode with Chandra observations of X-ray cavities, and LOFAR observations of radio emission. We confirm a decreasing trend in cool-core fractions towards the most massive galaxy clusters, which is well reproduced by the Magneticum simulations. This evolution is connected with an increased merge activity that injects high-energy particles into the core region, but it also requires thermalization and conductivity to enhance mixing through the ICM core, where both factors are increasingly efficient towards the high mass end. On the other hand, AGN feedback remains as the dominant factor at the scale of galaxy groups, while its relative impact decreases towards the most massive clusters. The problems suppressing star formation in simulations are not caused by low AGN feedback efficiencies. They root in the definition of the black hole sphere of influence used to distribute the feedback, which decreases as density and accretion rate increase. Actually, a decreasing AGN feedback efficiency towards low-mass galaxy groups is required to prevent overheating.

  We investigate the kinematical and dynamical properties of cluster galaxy populations classified according to their dominant source of gas ionization, namely: star-forming (SF) galaxies, optical active galactic nuclei (AGN), mixed SF plus AGN ionization (transition objects, T), and quiescent (Q) galaxies. We stack 8892 member galaxies from 336 relaxed galaxy clusters to build an ensemble cluster and estimate the observed projected profiles of numerical density and velocity dispersion, $\sigma_P(R)$, of each galaxy population. The MAMPOSSt code and the Jeans equations inversion technique are used to constrain the velocity anisotropy profiles of the galaxy populations in both parametric and non-parametric ways. We find that Q (SF) galaxies display the lowest (highest) typical cluster-centric distances and velocity dispersion values. Transition galaxies are more concentrated and tend to exhibit lower velocity dispersion values than SF galaxies. Galaxies that host an optical AGN are as concentrated as Q galaxies but display velocity dispersion values similar to those of the SF population. MAMPOSSt is able to find equilibrium solutions that successfully recover the observed $\sigma_P(R)$ profile only for the Q, T, and AGN populations. We find that the orbits of all populations are consistent with isotropy in the inner regions, becoming increasingly radial with the distance from the cluster centre. These results suggest that Q galaxies are in equilibrium within their clusters, while SF galaxies have more recently arrived in the cluster environment. Finally, the T and AGN populations appear to be in an intermediate dynamical state between those of the SF and Q populations.

  We present Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the compact group HCG 57, and optical integral field spectroscopy of the interacting galaxy pair HCG 57A/D. These two spiral galaxies recently suffered an off-axis collision with HCG 57D passing through the disk of A. We find evidence of a gas bridge linking the galaxies, containing ~10^8 Msol of hot, ~1 keV thermal plasma and warm ionized gas radiating in H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [OIII] and [NII] lines. The optical emission lines in the central regions of HCG 57D show excitation properties consistent with HII-regions, while the outer rim of HCG 57D, parts of the bridge and the outer regions of HCG 57A show evidence of shocked gas consistent with shock velocities of 200-300 km/s. In contrast, the X-ray emitting gas requires a collision velocity of ~650-750 km/s to explain the observed temperatures. These different shock velocities can be reconciled by considering the contributions of rotation to collision velocity in different parts of the disks, and the clumpy nature of the pre-shock medium in the galaxies, which likely lead to different shock velocities in different components of the turbulent post-shocked gas. We examine the diffuse X-ray emission in the group members and their associated point sources, identifying X-ray AGN in HCG 57A, B, and D. We also confirm the previously reported ~1 keV intra-group medium and find it to be relaxed with a low central entropy (18.0+-1.7 kev cm^2 within 20 kpc) but a long cooling time (5.9+-0.8 Gyr).

  We present a detailed analysis of AT 2020nov, a tidal disruption event (TDE) in the center of its host galaxy, located at a redshift of $z = 0.083$. AT 2020nov exhibits unique features, including double-peaked Balmer emission lines, a broad UV/optical flare, and a peak log luminosity in the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) estimated at $\sim$$45.66^{+0.10}_{-0.33} \; \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}$. A late-time X-ray flare was also observed, reaching an absorbed luminosity of $1.67 \times 10^{43} \; \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}$ approximately 300 days after the UV/optical peak. Multi-wavelength coverage, spanning optical, UV, X-ray, and mid-infrared (MIR) bands, reveals a complex spectral energy distribution (SED) that includes MIR flaring indicative of dust echoes, suggesting a dust covering fraction consistent with typical TDEs. Spectral modeling indicates the presence of an extended, quiescent disk around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a radius of $\sim$$5.06^{+0.59}_{-0.77} \times 10^4 \; \mathrm{R_g}$. The multi-component SED model, which includes a significant EUV component, suggests that the primary emission from the TDE is reprocessed by this extended disk, producing the observed optical and MIR features. The lack of strong AGN signatures in the host galaxy, combined with the quiescent disk structure, highlights AT 2020nov as a rare example of a TDE occurring in a galaxy with a dormant but extended pre-existing accretion structure.

  The Gamma-ray detection from an astrophysical object indicates the presence of an extreme environment where high-energy radiation is produced. With the continuous monitoring of the Gamma-ray sky by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), leading to deeper sensitivity, the high-energy Gamma-ray emission has now been detected from a diverse class of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN). Here, we present the results of a multiwavelength study of the radio source DA~362, which was reported to be a blazar candidate of uncertain type. However, it was recently identified as a bona fide compact symmetric object (CSO) based on its sub-kpc, bi-polar radio morphology, and lack of radio variability. This makes DA~362 the only fourth Gamma-ray emitting object of this enigmatic class of radio-loud AGN. Using five very long baseline interferometry observations covering 1996-2018, we found the jet separation velocity to be subluminal ($v_{\rm app}\sim 0.2c$), thus supporting its CSO nature. Its Fermi-LAT observations revealed a Gamma-ray flaring activity, a phenomenon never detected from the other three Gamma-ray detected CSOs. This object is bright in the near-infrared band but extremely faint in the optical-ultraviolet filters, hinting at possible obscuration. The Swift X-Ray Telescope observation of DA 362 reveals an extremely hard X-ray spectrum, though a strong claim cannot be made due to large uncertainties. We conclude that deeper observations are needed to probe the broadband properties of this enigmatic object and to understand the origin of high-energy Gamma-ray emission.

  This paper presents a deep MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) covering the rest-frame optical spectrum of the GN-z11 galaxy. The [OIII]5008 and H$\alpha$ emission lines are detected and spectroscopically resolved. The line profiles are well-modeled by a narrow Gaussian component with intrinsic FWHMs of 189$\pm$25 and 231$\pm$52 kms$^{-1}$, respectively. We do not find any evidence of a dominant broad H$\alpha$ emission line component tracing a Broad Line Region in a type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, a broad ($\sim$430-470 kms$^{-1}$) and weak ($&lt;$ 20-30%) H$\alpha$ line component, tracing a minor AGN contribution in the optical, cannot be ruled out completely with the sensitivity of the present data. The physical and excitation properties of the ionized gas are consistent with a low-metallicity starburst forming stars at a rate of SFR(H$\alpha$)$=$24 $\pm$3$M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. The electron temperature of the ionized gas is $T_{\mathrm{e}}$(O$^{++}$)$=$14000$\pm$2100K, while the direct-$T_{\mathrm{e}}$ gas-phase metallicity is 12+$\log$(O/H)$=$7.91$\pm$0.07 (Z=0.17$\pm$0.03Z$_{\odot}$). The optical line ratios locate GN-z11 in the starburst or AGN region but more consistent with those of local low-metallicity starbursts and high-$z$ luminous galaxies detected at redshifts similar to GN-z11. We conclude that the MRS optical spectrum of GN-z11 is consistent with that of a massive, compact, and low-metallicity starburst galaxy. Due to its high SFR and stellar mass surface densities, close to that of the densest stellar clusters, we speculate that GN-z11 could be undergoing a feedback-free, highly efficient starburst phase. Additional JWST data are needed to validate this scenario, and other recently proposed alternatives, to explain the existence of bright compact galaxies in the early Universe.

  We develop a simple method to search for changing-look (CL) active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates, and conduct a test run. In this method, optical variations of AGNs are monitored and CL-AGNs may appear to have a pattern of being bluer when in brightening flare-like events. Applying this method, previously-classified type 2 AGNs that show the bluer-when-brighter (BWB) pattern are selected. Among more than ten thousands type 2 AGNs classified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we find 73 candidates with possibly the strongest BWB pattern. We note that 13 of them have previously been reported as CL-AGNs. We have observed nine candidates, and found that five among them showed the CL transition from type 2 to type 1. In addition, we also test extending the selection to previously-classified type 1 AGNs in the SDSS by finding sources with a possible redder-when-brighter pattern, but none of the three sources observed by us is found to show the transition from type 1 to type 2. We discuss the variation properties in both the success and failure cases, and plan to observe more candidates selected with the method. From the observational results, a detailed comparison between the CL-AGNs and none CL-AGNs will help quantitatively refine the selection criteria and in turn allow us to configure the general properties of CLAGNs.
