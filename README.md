  Black hole accretion in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is coupled to the evolution of their host galaxies. Outflowing winds in AGN can play an important role in this evolution through the resulting feedback mechanism. Multi-wavelength spectroscopy is key for probing the intertwined physics of inflows and outflows in AGN. However, with the current spectrometers, crucial properties of the ionized outflows are poorly understood, such as their coupling to the accretion rate, their launching mechanism, and their kinetic power. In this paper we discuss the need for simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for tackling outstanding questions on these outflows in AGN. The instrumental requirements for achieving the scientific objectives are addressed. We demonstrate that these requirements would be facilitated by the proposed Arcus Probe mission concept. The multi-wavelength spectroscopy and timing by Arcus would enable us to establish the kinematics and ionization structure of the entire ionized outflow, extending from the vicinity of the accretion disk to the outskirts of the host galaxy. Arcus would provide key diagnostics on the origin, driving mechanism, and the energetics of the outflows, which are useful benchmarks for testing various theoretical models of outflows and understanding their impact in AGN.

  The occurrence frequency distributions of fluxes (F) and fluences or energies (E) observed in astrophysical observations are found to be consistent with the predictions of the fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model, which predicts power law slopes with universal constants of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux and $\alpha_E=(5/3)\approx 1.67$ for the fluence. The energy integrated over the power law-like (size distribution) energy range is found to be finite for these power law slopes with $\alpha_E &lt; 2$, which refutes earlier claims of a divergent energy integral that has been postulated in the energy budget of solar and stellar nanoflare scenarios. The theoretial FD-SOC model approximates the microscopic cellular automaton models satisfactorily with the macroscopic scaling law of classical diffusion. The universal scaling laws predict the size distributions of numerous astrophysical phenomena, such as solar flares, stellar flares, coronal mass ejections (CME), auroras, blazars, galactic fast radio bursts (FRB), active galactic nuclei (AGN), gamma-ray bursts (GRB), soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGB), and black-hole systems (BH), while coherent solar radio bursts, random radio bursts, solar energetic partices (SEP), cosmic rays, and pulsar glitches require non-standard SOC models.

  We present the first multi-band centimeter detection of POX 52, a nearby dwarf galaxy believed to habor a robust intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). We conducted the deep observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), spanning frequencies from 4.5 to 10 GHz, as well as the sensitive observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) operating in its most extended A-configuration at S band (2--4 GHz) and C band (4--8 GHz). In the ATCA observations, the source shows a compact morphology, with only one direction marginally resolved. The higher resolution of the VLA allowed us to slightly resolve the source, fitting it well with a two-dimensional Gaussian model. The detected radio emission confirms the presence of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity, indicating either a low-power jet or AGN-driven winds/outflows. Our dual-epoch observations with ATCA and VLA, together with previous non-detection flux density upper limits, reveal radio emission variability spanning two decades. In addition, we find that POX 52 aligns well with the low-mass extension of the fundamental plane for high-accretion, radio-quiet massive AGNs.

  JWST observations have unveiled faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high-redshift that provide insights on the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their coevolution with galaxies. However, disentangling stellar from AGN light in these sources is challenging. Here, we use an empirical approach to infer the average stellar mass of 6 faint broad line (BL) Halpha emitters at z = 4 - 5 with BH masses ~ 6 (4 - 15)x10^6 Msun, with a method independent of their spectral energy distribution (SED). We use the deep JWST/NIRcam grism survey ALT to measure the over-densities around BL-Halpha emitters and around a spectroscopic reference sample of ~300 galaxies. In our reference sample, we find that Mpc-scale over-density correlates with stellar mass, while pair counts are flat below ~50 kpc due to satellites. Their large-scale environments suggest that BL-Halpha emitters are hosted by galaxies with stellar masses ~5x10^7 Msun, ~40 times lower than those inferred from galaxy-only SED fits. Adding measurements around more luminous z~6 AGNs, we find tentative correlations between line width, BH mass and the over-density, suggestive of a steep BH to halo mass relation. The main implications are (1) when BH masses are taken at face value, we confirm extremely high BH to stellar mass ratios of ~10 %, (2) the low stellar mass galaxies hosting growing SMBHs are in tension with typical hydrodynamical simulations, except those without feedback, (3) a 1 % duty cycle implied by the host mass hints at super-Eddington accretion, which may imply over-estimated SMBH masses, (4) the masses are at odds with a high stellar density interpretation of the line broadening, (5) our results imply a diversity of galaxy masses, environments and SEDs among AGN samples, depending on their luminosity.

  Galaxy mergers have been shown to trigger AGN in the nearby universe, but the timescale over which this process happens remains unconstrained. The Multi-Model Merger Identifier (MUMMI) machine vision pipeline has been demonstrated to provide reliable predictions of time post-merger (T_PM) for galaxies selected from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared and Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) up to T_PM=1.76 Gyr after coalescence. By combining the post-mergers identified in UNIONS with pre-coalescence galaxy pairs, we can study the triggering of AGN throughout the merger sequence. AGN are identified using a range of complementary metrics: mid-IR colours, narrow emission lines and broad emission lines, which can be combined to provide insight into the demographics of dust and luminosity of the AGN population. Our main results are: 1) Regardless of the metric used, we find that the peak AGN excess (compared with a matched control sample) occurs immediately after coalescence, at 0 &lt; T_PM &lt; 0.16 Gyr. 2) The excess of AGN is observed until long after coalescence; both the mid-IR selected AGN and broad line AGN are more common than in the control sample even in the longest time bin of our sample (0.96 &lt; T_PM &lt; 1.76 Gyr). 3) The AGN excess is larger for more luminous and bolometrically dominant AGN, and we find that AGN in post-mergers are generally more luminous than secularly triggered events. 4) A deficit of broad line AGN in the pre-merger phase, that evolves into an excess in post-mergers is consistent with evolution of the covering fraction of nuclear obscuring material. Before coalescence, tidally triggered inflows increase the covering fraction of nuclear dust; in the post-merger regime feedback from the AGN clears (at least some of) this material. 5) The statistical peak in the triggering of starbursts occurs contemporaneously with AGN, within 0.16 Gyr of coalescence.

  Distant quasars (QSOs) in galaxy overdensities are considered key actors in the evolution of the early Universe. In this work, we studied the kinematic and physical properties of the BR1202-0725 system at z=4.7, one of the most overdense fields known in the early Universe, consisting of a QSO, a submillimeter galaxy (SMG), and three Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters. We used data from the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) to analyze the rest-frame optical emission of each source in the system. We estimated a bolometric luminosity of log($L_{\rm bol}/$[erg/s]) = 47.2 $\pm$ 0.4 and a black hole mass of log($M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot$) = 10.1 $\pm$ 0.5 for the QSO, which are consistent with previous measurements obtained with ground-based observations. The NIRSpec spectra of the SMG revealed instead unexpected [OIII] and H$\alpha$+[NII] profiles. The overall [OIII] line profile is blue-shifted by more than 700 km/s relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Additionally, both the [OIII] and H$\alpha$+[NII] lines show prominent broad (1300 km/s), blueshifted wings associated with outflowing ionized gas. The analysis of NIRSpec and X-ray observations indicates that the SMG likely hosts an accreting supermassive black hole as supported by the following results: (i) the excitation diagnostic diagram is consistent with ionization from an active galactic nucleus (AGN); (ii) the X-ray luminosity is higher than $10^{44}$ erg/s; and (iii) it hosts a fast outflow ($v_{\rm out}$ = 5000 km/s), comparable to those observed in luminous QSOs. Therefore, the QSO-SMG pair represents one of the highest-redshift double AGN to date, with a projected separation of 24 kpc. Finally, we investigated the environment of this system and found four new galaxies at the same redshift of the QSO and within a projected distance of 5 kpc from it. This overdense system includes at least ten galaxies in only 980 kpc$^2$.
