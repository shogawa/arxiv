  The presence of evolved stars in high-redshift galaxies can place valuable indirect constraints on the onset of star formation in the Universe. Thus we use a combination of PEARLS GTO and public NIRCam photometric data to search for Balmer break candidate galaxies at $7 &lt; z &lt; 12$. We find that our Balmer break candidates at $z \sim 10.5$ tend to be older (115 Myr), have lower inferred [O III] + H$\beta$ emission line equivalent widths (120 \r{A}), have lower specific star formation rates (6 Gyr$^{-1}$) and redder UV slopes ($\beta = -1.8$) than our control sample of galaxies. However, these trends all become less strong at $z \sim 8$, where the F444W filter now probes the strong rest-frame optical emission lines, thus providing additional constraints on the current star formation activity of these galaxies. These weaker trends likely reflect the bursty nature of these Epoch of Reionisation galaxies, which can lead to a disconnect between their current star formation activity and SED profiles, and their more extended star formation history. We discuss how strong emission lines, the cumulative effect of weak emission lines, dusty continua and AGN can all contribute to the photometric excess seen in the rest-frame optical, thus mimicking the signature of a Balmer break. Additional medium-band imaging will thus be essential to more robustly identify Balmer break galaxies. However, the Balmer break alone cannot serve as a definitive proxy for the stellar age of galaxies, being complexly dependent on the star formation history. Ultimately, deep NIRSpec continuum spectroscopy and MIRI imaging will provide the strongest indirect constraints on the formation era of the first galaxies in the Universe, thereby revealing when cosmic dawn breaks.

  We present a new energy transport code that models the time dependent and non-linear evolution of spectra of cosmic-ray nuclei, their secondaries, and photon target fields. The software can inject an arbitrary chemical composition including heavy elements up to iron nuclei. Energy losses and secondary production due to interactions of cosmic ray nuclei, secondary mesons, leptons, or gamma-rays with a target photon field are available for all relevant processes, e.g., photo-meson production, photo disintegration, synchrotron radiation, Inverse Compton scattering, and more. The resulting x-ray fluxes can be fed back into the simulation chain to correct the initial photon targets, resulting in a non-linear treatment of the energy transport. The modular structure of the code facilitates simple extension of interaction or target field models. We will show how the software can be used to improve predictions of observables in various astrophysical sources such as jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN). Since the software can model the propagation of heavy ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays inside the source it can precisely predict the chemical composition at the source. This will also refine predictions of neutrino emissions - they strongly depend on the chemical composition. This helps in the future to optimize the selection and analyses of data from the IceCube neutrino observatory with the aim to enhance the sensitivity of IceCube and reduce the number of trial factors.

  The Active Galatic Nuclei(AGN) disk has been proposed as a potential channel for the merger of binary black holes. The population of massive stars and black holes in AGN disks captured from the nuclei cluster plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of binary formation and final merger rate within the AGN disks. In this paper, we investigate the capture process using analytical and numerical approaches. We discover a new constant integral of motion for one object's capture process. {Applying this result to the whole population of the nuclei cluster captured by the AGN disk, we find that the population of captured objects} depends on the angular density and eccentricity distribution of the nuclei clusters and is effectively independent of the radial density profile of the nuclei cluster and disk models. An isotropic nuclei cluster with thermal eccentricity distribution predicts a captured profile $\dd N/\dd r\propto r^{-1/4}$. The captured objects are found to be dynamically crowded within the disk. Direct binary formation right after the capture would be promising, especially for stars. The conventional migration traps that help pile up single objects in AGN disks for black hole mergers might not be required.

  We present an analysis of the ultra-violet (UV) observations of two Seyfert type active galactic nuclei (AGN), namely NGC$~$4051 and NGC$~$4151. These observations aimed at studying the star formation in the hosts of these AGN were carried out with the ultra-violet imaging telescope on board AstroSat in far-UV. A total of 193 and 328 star-forming regions (SF) were identified using SExtractor in NGC$~$4051 and NGC$~$4151, respectively. Using aperture photometry of the identified SF regions, we estimated the star formation rates (SFRs). We found NGC$~$4051 to have the lowest SFR with a median value of 3.16 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ while for NGC$~$4151, we found a median SFR of 0.012 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

  We present a comprehensive multi-wavelength study of 5 poststarburst galaxies with $M_\ast &gt; 10^{11} M_\odot$ at $z\sim 0.7$, examining their stars, gas, and current and past star-formation activities. Using optical images from the Subaru telescope and Hubble Space Telescope, we observe a high incidence of companion galaxies and low surface brightness tidal features, indicating that quenching is closely related to interactions between galaxies. From optical spectra provided by the LEGA-C survey, we model the stellar continuum to derive the star-formation histories and show that the stellar masses of progenitors ranging from $2\times10^9 M_\odot$ to $10^{11} M_\odot$, undergoing a burst of star formation several hundred million years prior to observation, with a decay time scale of $\sim100$ million years. Our ALMA observations detect CO(2-1) emission in four galaxies, with the molecular gas spreading over up to $&gt;1"$, or $\sim10$ kpc, with a mass of up to $\sim2 \times10^{10} M_\odot$. However, star-forming regions are unresolved by either the slit spectra or 3~GHz continuum observed by the Very Large Array. Comparisons between the star-formation rates and gas masses, and the sizes of CO emission and star-forming regions suggest a low star-forming efficiency. We show that the star-formation rates derived from IR and radio luminosities with commonly-used calibrations tend to overestimate the true values because of the prodigious amount of radiation from old stars and the contribution from AGN, as the optical spectra reveal weak AGN-driven outflows.

  The tight correlations between the masses of supermassive black holes (BHs) and the properties of their host galaxies suggest that BHs coevolve with galaxies. However, what is the link between BH mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and the properties of the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the nearby Universe? We measure stellar masses ($M_*$), colors, and structural properties for $\sim11,500$ $z\leq0.35$ broad-line AGNs, nearly 40 times larger than that in any previous work. We find that early-type and late-type AGNs follow a similar $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relation. The position of AGNs on the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ plane is connected with the properties of star formation and BH accretion. Our results unveil the evolutionary paths of galaxies on the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ plane: objects above the relation tend to evolve more horizontally with substantial $M_*$ growth; objects on the relation move along the local relation; and objects below the relation migrate more vertically with substantial $M_{\rm BH}$ growth. These trajectories suggest that radiative-mode feedback cannot quench the growth of BHs and their host galaxies for AGNs that lie below the relation, while kinetic-mode feedback hardly suppress long-term star formation for AGNs situated above the relation. This work provides important constraints for numerical simulations and offers a framework for studying the cosmic coevolution of supermassive BHs and their host galaxies.
