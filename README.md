  The distribution of baryons provides a significant way to understand the formation of galaxy clusters by revealing the details of its internal structure and changes over time. In this paper, we present theoretical studies on the scaled profiles of physical properties associated with the baryonic components, including gas density, temperature, metallicity, pressure and entropy as well as stellar mass, metallicity and satellite galaxy number density in galaxy clusters from $z=4$ to $z=0$ by tracking their progenitors. These mass-complete simulated galaxy clusters are coming from THE THREE HUNDRED with two runs: GIZMO-SIMBA and Gadget-X. Through comparisons between the two simulations, and with observed profiles which are generally available at low redshift, we find that (1) the agreements between the two runs and observations are mostly at outer radii $r \gtrsim 0.3r_{500}$, in line with the self-similarity assumption. While Gadget-X shows better agreements with the observed gas profiles in the central regions compared to GIZMO-SIMBA; (2) the evolution trends are generally consistent between the two simulations with slightly better consistency at outer radii. In detail, the gas density profile shows less discrepancy than the temperature and entropy profiles at high redshift. The differences in the cluster centre and gas properties imply different behaviours of the AGN models between Gadget-X and GIZMO-SIMBA, with the latter, maybe too strong for this cluster simulation. The high-redshift difference may be caused by the star formation and feedback models or hydrodynamics treatment, which requires observation constraints and understanding.

  X-ray polarimetry is a powerful tool to probe the geometry of the hot X-ray corona in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Here, we present our results on the characterisation of the X-ray polarization of the radio-quiet Seyfert-type AGN IC 4329A at a redshift of $z$ = 0.016. This is based on observations carried out by the {\it Imaging X-ray Polarimeter (IXPE)}. {\it IXPE} observed IC 4329A on January 5, 2023, for a total observing time of 458 ks. From the model-independent analysis, we found a polarization degree ($\Pi_{X}$) of 3.7$\pm$1.5$\%$ and a polarization position angle ($\Psi_{X}$) of 61$^{\circ}$$\pm$12$^{\circ}$ in the 2$-$8 keV energy range (at 1$\sigma$ confidence level). This is also in agreement with the values of $\Pi_{X}$ and $\Psi_{X}$ of 4.7$\pm$2.2$\%$ and 71$^{\circ}$ $\pm$14$^{\circ}$ respectively obtained from spectro-polarimetric analysis of the I, Q and U Stokes spectra in the 2$-$8 keV energy band (at the 90$\%$ confidence). The value of $\Pi_X$ in the 2-8 keV band obtained from the model-independent analysis is lower than the minimum detectable polarization (MDP) value of 4.5$\%$. However, $\Pi_X$ obtained from spectro-polarimetric analysis in the 2-8 keV band is larger than the MDP value. In the 3-5 keV band, we found $\Pi_X$ of 6.5 $\pm$ 1.8, which is larger than the MDP value of 5.5$\%$. The observed moderate value of $\Pi_{X}$ obtained from the analysis of the {\it IXPE} data in the 3$-$5 keV band argues against a spherical lamp$-$post geometry for the X-ray corona in IC 4329A; however, considering simulations, the observed polarization measurements tend to favour a conical shape geometry for the corona. This is the first time measurement of X-ray polarization in IC 4329A. Measurements of the X-ray polarization in many such radio-quiet AGN will help in constraining the geometry of the X-ray corona in AGN.

  We investigate the coalescence of massive black hole ($M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 10^{6}~\rm M_{\odot}$) binaries (MBHBs) at $6&lt;z&lt;10$ by adopting a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, zoomed-in on biased ($ &gt;3 \sigma$) overdense regions ($M_h\sim 10^{12}~\rm M_{\odot}$ dark matter halos at $z = 6$) of the Universe. We first analyse the impact of different resolutions and AGN feedback prescriptions on the merger rate, assuming instantaneous mergers. Then, we compute the halo bias correction factor due to the overdense simulated region. Our simulations predict merger rates that range between 3 - 15 $\rm yr^{-1}$ at $z\sim 6$, depending on the run considered, and after correcting for a bias factor of $\sim 20-30$.   For our fiducial model, we further consider the effect of delay in the MBHB coalescence due to dynamical friction. We find that 83 per cent of MBHBs will merge within the Hubble time, and 21 per cent within 1 Gyr, namely the age of the Universe at $z &gt; 6$. We finally compute the expected properties of the gravitational wave (GW) signals and find the fraction of LISA detectable events with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR $&gt;$ 5) to range between 66-69 per cent. However, identifying the electro-magnetic counterpart of these events remains challenging due to the poor LISA sky localization that, for the loudest signals ($\mathcal M_c\sim 10^6~\rm M_{\odot}$ at $z=6$), is around 10 $\rm deg^2$.
