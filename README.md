  Dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with comparable masses are commonly witnessed among the major merged galaxies with interaction remnants. Considering almost every massive galaxy is associated with multiple dwarf satellites around it, minor mergers involving galaxies with disproportional stellar masses should be much more common than major mergers, which would naturally lead to black hole (BH) pairs with significantly different masses. However, dual AGNs generated by minor mergers involving one or two dwarf galaxies are exceptionally rare and understudied. Moreover, good estimates of the masses of both BHs are not yet available to test this idea. Here we report the evidence of a dual AGN candidate with mass ratio $\sim$7:1 located in an undisturbed disk galaxy. We identify the central BH with mass of $9.4 \times 10^6M_\odot$ from its radio emission as well as AGN-driven galactic-scale biconical outflows. The off-centered BH generates obvious broad and narrow emission-line regions, which gives us a robust estimation of a $1.3 \times 10^6M_\odot$ BH mass. We explore alternative scenarios for explaining the observational features of this system, including the complex gas kinematics triggered by central AGN activity and dust attenuation of the broad-line region of the central BH, finding that they failed to fully account for the kinematics of both the redshifted off-centered broad and narrow emission-line components.

  We model continuous gravitational wave (CW) sources detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), using the ASTRID cosmological simulation. The most detectable single sources are in the low-frequency bins and are produced by the most supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers (with M_BH ~ 10^10 - 10^11 solarmass) in the most massive galaxies M_star ~ 10^12 solarmass. Remarkably, these mergers (mostly at z&lt; 0.3) occur within massive galaxies residing at the center of galaxy clusters. Particularly striking in ASTRID is a triple merger event, where two subsequent mergers in the same cluster core generate high-detection-probability CW signals at ~ 2nHz and ~ 10nHz. We expect electromagnetic signatures from these events: either single or dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) and massive host galaxies that are undergoing significant star formation. We establish a novel connection between these high-mass, central cluster mergers, occurring in galaxies with active star formation and AGN, and the formation process of the central cluster galaxy in ASTRID. This provides new insights into the low-frequency gravitational wave sky and informs future multi-messenger searches for PTA CW sources.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a key component of galaxy evolution due to feedback on the host from its supermassive black hole. The morphology of warm, in- and outflowing dusty material can reveal the nature of the onset of feedback, AGN feeding, and the unified model of AGN. Here we use the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) to image the dense, obscuring disk and extended dusty outflow region of NGC 1068. In Fizeau imaging mode the LBTI synthesizes the equivalent resolution of a 22.8 m telescope. The 8.7 $\mu$m Fizeau images of NGC 1068 {have an effective resolution of $47\times90$ mas ($3.3\times6.2$ pc)} in a 5" field of view after performing PSF deconvolution techniques described here. This is the only extragalactic source to be Fizeau imaged using the LBTI, and the images bridge the scales measured with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI; 0.5-5 pc) and those of single telescopes such as JWST and Keck ($&gt;15$ pc). The images detect and spatially resolve the low surface brightness mid-infrared (MIR) features in the AGN disk/wind region that are over-resolved by the VLTI. The images show strong correlation between MIR dust emission and near-infrared (NIR) emission of highly excited atomic lines observed by SINFONI. Such LBTI imaging is a precursor to infrared imaging using the upcoming generation of extremely large telescopes, with angular resolutions up to 6x better than JWST, the largest space telescope in orbit.

  The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been the first astrophysical source associated with high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, and it has emerged as the second-most-prominent hotspot in the neutrino sky over ten years of observations. Although neutrino production in blazars has traditionally been attributed to processes in the powerful relativistic jet, the observation of a significant neutrino flux from NGC 1068 -- presumably coming from the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) corona -- suggests that neutrinos can also be produced in the cores of AGN. This raises the question whether neutrino production in TXS~0506+056 is also associated with the core region. We study this scenario, focusing on the hypothesis that this blazar is a masquerading BL Lac, a high-excitation quasar with hidden broad emission lines and a standard accretion disk. We show that magnetic reconnection is an acceleration process necessary to reach tens of PeV proton energies, and we use observationally motivated estimates of the X-ray luminosity of the coronal region to predict the emission of secondaries and compare them to the observed multi-wavelength and neutrino spectra of the source. We find that the coronal neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 is too low to describe the IceCube observed neutrinos from this AGN, which in turn suggests that the blazar jet remains the preferred location for neutrino production.

  The quenching of star formation activity represents a critical phase for a non-negligible fraction of the observed galaxy population at all cosmic epochs, marking a transition from an epoch of intense mass growth to an extended period of passive evolution. Over the past years, we have collected a detailed characterization of how the fraction of quenched galaxies evolves as a function of cosmic time (it grows at later cosmic epochs), and correlates with the physical properties of galaxies (more massive galaxies, that also tend to be bulge-dominated, are more likely to be quenched) and with their environment (denser environments host larger fractions of quiescent galaxies). Different physical processes can lead to a suppression of star formation. These include internal processes (processes that do not depend on the environment in which galaxies live, e.g. stellar and AGN feedback mechanisms) and processes that instead depend on the environment (e.g. mergers, gas stripping processes). In this chapter, we summarize the observational and theoretical status of the field, highlighting the most recent results and the questions that are yet to be answered. We also summarize our view on the expected developments in the next few years.

  Nearby extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs) allow us to study primitive galaxy formation and evolution in greater detail than is possible at high redshift. This work, for the first time, promotes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to efficiently search for XMPs in multi-band imaging data based on their predicted N2 index (N2\,$\equiv\log$\{\rNii/\Ha\}). We developed a sequential characterisation pipeline, composed of three CNN procedures: (i) a classifier for metal-poor galaxies, (ii) a classifier for XMPs, and (iii) an N2 predictor. The pipeline is applied to over 7.7 million SDSS DR17 imaging data without SDSS spectroscopy. The predicted N2 values are used to select promising candidates for observations. This approach was validated by new observations of 45 candidates with redshifts less than 0.065 using the 2.54~m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) and the 4.1~m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope between 2023 and 2024. All 45 candidates are confirmed to be metal-poor, including 28 new discoveries. There are 18/45 galaxies lacking detectable \rNii\ lines ($S/N&lt;2$); for these, we report $2\sigma$ upper limits on their oxygen abundance. Our XMPs have estimated oxygen abundances of $7.1\leq$\OH$\leq8.7$ ($2\sigma$ upper limit), based on the N2 index, and 21 of them with estimated metallicity $&lt;0.1~Z_{\odot}$. Additionally, we identified 4 potential candidates of low-metallicity AGNs at $\lesssim0.1Z_{\odot}$. Finally, we found that our observed samples are mostly brighter in the $g-$band compared to other filters, similar to blueberry (BB) galaxies, resembling green pea galaxies and high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitters.

  We investigate the time delay incurred during ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) propagation over cosmological distances and its potential impact on the correlation between UHECR directions of arrival and sources such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), the UHECR chemical composition, and extragalactic magnetic field constraints. We propagate particles in different magnetic field configurations, spanning over an extended range of particle Larmor radii and magnetic field coherence lengths, also including attenuation losses. We find that UHECR delays could easily be comparable to (and longer than) AGN duty cycles, effectively erasing the correlation between known AGNs and UHECR anisotropies. We finally consider how strong constraints on the chemical composition of the heaviest UHECRs could enable a better characterization of extragalactic magnetic fields.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is a key physical mechanism proposed to regulate star formation, primarily in massive galaxies. In particular, cosmic rays associated with AGN jets have the potential to efficiently suppress cooling flows and quench star formation. The locus of cosmic ray production and their coupling to gas play a crucial role in the overall self-regulation process. To investigate this in detail, we conduct high-resolution, non-cosmological MHD simulations of a massive $10^{14} {\rm M_\odot}$ halo using the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model. We explore a variety of AGN jet feedback scenarios with cosmic rays, examining different values for the cosmic ray energy fraction in jets, cosmic ray coupling sites (in the black hole vicinity versus at the large-scale jet-driven shock front), and jet precession parameters. Our findings indicate that when cosmic rays are injected near the black hole, they efficiently inhibit black hole accretion by suppressing the density before the jet propagates out to large radii. As a result, this leads to episodic black hole accretion, with the jet not having sufficient energy flux to reach large radii and impact cooling flows. Conversely, if the cosmic rays are injected at the jet-driven shock front, not only does the jet sustain a higher overall energy flux for an extended period, but it also disperses cosmic rays out to larger radii, more effectively suppressing the cooling flow. Furthermore, the period and angle of jet precession can influence the position of shock fronts. We identify an optimal range of jet precession periods ($\sim$ tens of Myr) that generates shocks at the inner circumgalactic medium, where cooling flows are most severe. We report that this specific configuration offers the most effective scenario for cosmic rays at the shock front to suppress the cooling flow and star formation.   

A New Interpretation for the Hot Corona in Active Galactic Nuclei

  This work attempts to provide a new interpretation for the hot corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A thin   parabolic magnetic reconnection layer, anchored at the innermost disk and extending along the boundary of the   magnetic tower for a few tens of gravitational radii, serves as a hard-X-ray source above the disk. Within this   reconnection layer, the tearing instability leads to the formation of a chain of plasmoids, which contain relativistic   electrons that generate X-ray radiation through inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of soft photons emitted by the   accretion disk. Based on previous theoretical works and numerical simulations, we develop a heuristic framework   to parameterize the geometry and magnetization of the reconnection layer, as well as to compute both the power of   the IC-scattering radiation and the height of the reconnection layer. Our model allows for a quantitative   investigation of the relation between the height of the corona and the X-ray radiation luminosity, which can be   directly compared against the observed relation from X-ray reverberation mapping of individual AGNs. The   theoretical results are in good agreement with the observations of IRAS 13224-3809, indicating the validation of   our model.

  Hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources, such as bright extragalactic sources characterized by particularly soft X-ray spectra, offer a unique opportunity to study accretion onto supermassive black holes in extreme conditions. Examples of hyperluminous supersoft sources are tidal disruption events, systems exhibiting quasi-periodic eruptions, changing-look AGN, and anomalous nuclear transients. Although these objects are rare phenomena amongst the population of X-ray sources, we developed an efficient algorithm to identify promising candidates exploiting archival observations. In this work, we present the results of a search for hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources in the recently released Chandra catalog of serendipitous X-ray sources. This archival search has been performed via both a manual implementation of the algorithm we developed and a novel machine-learning-based approach. This search identified a new tidal disruption event, which might have occurred in an intermediate-mass black hole. This event occurred between 2001 and 2002, making it one of the first tidal disruption events ever observed by Chandra.
