  The characteristic timescale ($\tau$) of continuum variability of the accretion disk in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is known to be related to the thermal timescale, which is predicted to scale with AGN luminosity ($L$) and restframe wavelength ($\lambda_{\rm RF}$) as $t_{\rm th} \propto L^{0.5} \lambda_{\rm RF}^2$ in the standard disk model. Using multi-epoch spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project, we construct ultraviolet ensemble structure functions of luminous AGNs as a function of their luminosity and wavelength. Assuming that AGNs exhibit a single universal structure function when $\Delta t$ is normalized by $\tau$, wherein $\tau \propto L^{a} \lambda_{\rm RF}^{b}$, we find $a=0.50\pm0.03$ and $b=1.42\pm0.09$. While the value of $a$ aligns with the prediction from the standard disk model, $b$ is significantly smaller than expected, suggesting that the radial temperature (color) profile of the accretion disk is significantly steeper (shallower) than the standard disk model. Notably, this discrepancy with theory has been observed in previous studies based on spectroscopic reverberation mapping and gravitational microlensing. Although no current model of accretion disks fully matches our results, our findings provide valuable constraints for testing future physical models.

  We present an analysis of the cluster X-ray morphology and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in nine $z\sim1$ galaxy clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of $WISE$ Survey (MaDCoWS) observed with $Chandra$. Using photon asymmetry ($A_{\text{phot}}$) to quantify X-ray morphologies, we find evidence that the four most dynamically disturbed clusters are likely to be mergers. Employing a luminosity cut of $7.6\times10^{42}$ erg/s to identify AGN in the 0.7-7.0 keV, we show that the majority of these clusters host excess AGN compared to the local field. We use the cumulative number-count ($\log N-\log S$) model to predict AGN incidence in cluster isophotes under this luminosity cut. Our analysis finds evidence (at $&gt; 2\sigma$) of a positive correlation between AGN surface densities and photon asymmetry, suggesting that a disturbed cluster environment plays a pivotal role in regulating AGN triggering. Studying AGN incidence in cluster X-ray isophotes equivalent in area to $1.0r_{500}$, we find that the AGN space density inversely scales with cluster mass as $\sim M^{-0.5^{+0.18}_{-0.18}}$ at the 3.18$\sigma$ level. Finally, when we separately explore the cluster mass dependence of excess AGN surface density in disturbed and relaxed clusters, we see tentative evidence that the two morphologically distinct sub-populations exhibit diverging trends, especially near the outskirts, likely due to cluster merger-driven AGN triggering/suppression.

  We build upon the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model \texttt{FEGA24} (Formation and Evolution of GAlaxies, \citealt{contini2024d}), which integrates the latest prescriptions relevant to galaxy formation and evolution, alongside a comprehensive AGN feedback model. This model incorporates three modes of feedback: negative (preventing excessive cooling), positive (enhancing star formation), and hot gas ejection (expelling gas beyond the virial radius of halos). These modes operate in a coordinated manner: the negative mode regulates the cooling process, the positive mode promotes bursts of star formation, and the hot gas ejection mode expels gas beyond the virial radius when the AGN is sufficiently powerful. Our updated semi-analytic model, \texttt{FEGA25}, retains the qualitative and quantitative consistency of the analyses presented in \cite{contini2024d}, while delivering more robust results. Notably, \texttt{FEGA25} provides a more detailed characterization of the fraction of red galaxies as a function of stellar mass, predicts a main sequence of star-forming galaxies more consistent with observations, and estimates the fraction of hot gas in halos closer to observed values. These findings underscore the importance of a physical mechanism capable of ejecting hot gas beyond the virialized region of dark matter halos without significantly altering the stellar and cold gas components. Such a mechanism is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of other processes, such as cooling and star formation. Since supernova feedback is already modeled at its maximum efficiency, AGN feedback emerges as the natural candidate for this role.

  We present a spectroscopic study of the ``Disco Ball'' (SMDG0038365-064207), a rotationally-supported, red-sequence, ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) with a nuclear star cluster (NSC), multiple stellar clusters, and active star-forming regions using data obtained with KCWI on the Keck II Telescope. We calculate that the galaxy hosts $34\pm11$ ``globular" clusters. Kinematic measurements confirm rotation with a peak rotational velocity of at least 53km s$^{-1}$ and a dynamical mass within $r_{\rm e}$ of at least $10^{9.3 \pm 0.2}M_{\odot}$. Our dynamical estimates of the halo mass are consistent with that obtained using the number of globular clusters and together suggest $M_{\rm h}=10^{11.1\pm0.2}M_{\odot}$. The NSC may exhibit signatures of weak AGN activity. Our findings challenge two common assumptions: (1) clusters in some UDGs may be younger than generally assumed, and thus more luminous than standard globular clusters (GCs), affecting GC counts and the derived GC luminosity function in these UDGs, and (2) quiescent UDGs can be rotationally supported, making kinematic measurements viewing-angle dependent in such cases. The Disco Ball, while unremarkable in mass, size, projected structural properties, or color, reveals surprising complexity, highlighting the need for detailed studies of more UDGs.
