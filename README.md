  We make an in-depth analysis of different AGN jet models' signatures, inducing quiescence in galaxies with a halo mass of $10^{12} M_\odot$. Three jet models, including cosmic ray-dominant, hot thermal, and precessing kinetic jets, are studied at two energy flux levels each, compared to a jet-free, stellar feedback-only simulation. We examine the distribution of Mg II, O VI, and O VIII ions, alongside gas temperature and density profiles. Low-energy ions, like Mg II, concentrate in the ISM, while higher energy ions, e.g., O VIII, prevail at the AGN jet cocoon's edge. High-energy flux jets display an isotropic ion distribution with lower overall density. High-energy thermal or cosmic ray jets pressurize at smaller radii, significantly suppressing core density. The cosmic ray jet provides extra pressure support, extending cool and warm gas distribution. A break in the ion-to-mass ratio slope in O VI and O VIII is demonstrated in the ISM-to-CGM transition (between 10-30 kpc), growing smoothly towards the CGM at greater distances.

  We model the evolution of active galactic nuclei by constructing their radio luminosity functions. We use a set of surveys of varying area and depth, namely the deep COSMOS survey of $1,916$ AGN sources, the wide shallow 3CRR, 7C and 6CE surveys, containing together $356$ AGNs, and the intermediate XXL-North and South fields consisting of $899$ and $1,484$ sources, respectively. We also used the CENSORS, BRL, Wall $\&amp;$ Peacock and Config surveys, consisting respectively of $150$, $178$, $233$ and $230$ sources. Together, these surveys numbered $5,446$ AGN sources and constrained the luminosity functions at high redshift and over a wide range of luminosities (up to $z \approx 3$ and $\log (L / \mathrm{W Hz^{-1}}) \in [22,29])$. We concentrate on parametric methods within the Bayesian framework and show that the luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) model fits the data best, with evidence ratios varying from "strong" ($&gt;10$) to "decisive" ($&gt;100$) according to the Jeffreys interpretation. We determine the number density, luminosity density and kinetic luminosity density as a function of redshift, and observe a flattening of these functions at higher redshifts, not present in simpler models, which we explain by our use of the LDDE model. Finally, we divide our sample into subsets according to the stellar mass of the host galaxies in order to investigate a possible bimodality in evolution. We found a difference in LF shape and evolution between these subsets. All together, these findings point to a physical picture where the evolution and density of AGN cannot be explained well by simple models but require more complex models either via AGN sub-populations where the total AGN sample is divided into subsamples according to various properties such as, for example, optical properties and stellar mass, or via luminosity-dependent functions.

  We investigate the thermodynamics of close encounters between stellar mass black holes (BHs) in the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN), during which binary black holes (BBHs) may form. We consider a suite of 2D viscous hydrodynamical simulations within a shearing box prescription using the Eulerian grid code Athena++. We study formation scenarios where the fluid is either an isothermal gas or an adiabatic mixture of gas and radiation in local thermal equilibrium. We include the effects of viscous and shock heating, as well as optically thick cooling. We co-evolve the embedded BHs with the gas, keeping track of the energetic dissipation and torquing of the BBH by gas and inertial forces. We find that compared to the isothermal case, the minidiscs formed around each BH are significantly hotter and more diffuse, though BBH formation is still efficient. We observe massive blast waves arising from collisions between the radiative minidiscs during both the initial close encounter, and subsequent periapsis periods for successfully bound BBHs. These "disc novae" have a profound effect, depleting the BBH Hill sphere of gas and injecting energy into the surrounding medium. In analysing the thermal emission from these events, we observe periodic peaks in local luminosity associated with close encounters/periapses, with emission peaking in the optical/near-IR. In the AGN outskirts, these outbursts can reach 4% of the AGN luminosity in the IR band, with flares rising over 0.5-1year. Collisions in different disc regions, or when treated in 3D with magnetism, may produce more prominent flares.

  The superb image quality, stability and sensitivity of the JWST permit deconvolution techniques to be pursued with a fidelity unavailable to ground-based observations. We present an assessment of several deconvolution approaches to improve image quality and mitigate effects of the complex JWST point spread function (PSF). The optimal deconvolution method is determined by using WebbPSF to simulate JWST's complex PSF and MIRISim to simulate multi-band JWST/Mid-Infrared Imager Module (MIRIM) observations of a toy model of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Five different deconvolution algorithms are tested: (1) Kraken deconvolution, (2) Richardson-Lucy, (3) Adaptive Imaging Deconvolution Algorithm, (4) Sparse regularization with the Condat-V\~u algorithm, and (5) Iterative Wiener Filtering and Thresholding. We find that Kraken affords the greatest FWHM reduction of the nuclear source of our MIRISim observations for the toy AGN model while retaining good photometric integrity across all simulated wavebands. Applying Kraken to Galactic Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) multi-band JWST/MIRIM observations of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 5728, we find that the algorithm reduces the FWHM of the nuclear source by a factor of 1.6-2.2 across all five filters. Kraken images facilitate detection of a SE to NW $\thicksim$2".5 ($\thicksim$470 pc, PA $\simeq$115\deg) extended nuclear emission, especially in the longest wavelengths. We demonstrate that Kraken is a powerful tool to enhance faint features otherwise hidden in the complex JWST PSF.

  We present a two-dimensional study of the gas distribution, excitation and kinematics of the OH absorber galaxy IRAS 19154+2704 using Gemini GMOS-IFU observations. Its continuum image shows a disturbed morphology indicative of a past or on-going interaction. The ionised gas emission presents two kinematic components: a narrow ($\sigma\lesssim$300 km s$^{-1}$) component that may be tracing the gas orbiting in the galaxy potential and a broad ($\sigma\gtrsim$500 km s$^{-1}$) component which is produced by an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) driven outflow, with velocities reaching $-$500 km s$^{-1}$ which may exceed the escape velocity of the galaxy. The emission-line ratios and BPT diagrams confirm that the gas excitation in the inner $\sim$2 kpc is mainly due the AGN, while in regions farther away, a contribution from star formation is observed. We estimate a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm out}=4.0\pm2.6$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of 850 pc from the nucleus. The corresponding outflow kinetic power $\dot{E}_{\rm out} = (2.5\pm1.6)\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, is only $3\times10^{-4}$ L$_{\rm bol}$ (the AGN luminosity), but the large mass-outflow rate, if kept for a $\sim$10 Myr AGN lifecycle, will expel $\approx10^8$ M$_\odot$ in ionised gas alone. This is the 6th of a series of papers in which we have investigated the kinematics of ULIRGS, most of which are interacting galaxies showing OH Megamasers. IRAS19154 shows the strongest signatures of an active AGN, supporting an evolutionary scenario: interactions trigger AGN that fully appear in the most advanced stages of the interaction.

  We study dual AGN host galaxy morphologies at $z=2$ using the ASTRID simulation, selecting black hole (BH) pairs with small separation ($\Delta r&lt;30\rm{kpc}$), high mass ($M_{\text{BH,12}}&gt;10^7M_\odot$), and luminosity ($L_{\text{bol,12}}&gt;10^{43}\rm{erg/s}$). We kinematically decompose (using MORDOR) $\sim1000$ dual AGN hosts into standard components - a `disk' (thin and thick disk, pseudo-bulge) and 'bulge' (bulge and halo) and define disk-dominated galaxies by the disk-to-total $D/T\geq0.5$. In ASTRID, $60.9\pm2.1\%$ of dual AGN hosts (independent of separation) are disk-dominated, with the $D/T$ distribution peaking at $\sim0.7$. Notably, hosts of BH pairs have similar morphologies (most either both disk or bulge-dominated). In dual-AGN hosts, the $D/T$ increases from $\sim17\% $ at $M_{\rm *}\sim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ to $ 64\% $ for $M_{\rm *} \sim 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$, and the pseudo-bulge is the dominant component of the disk fraction at the high mass end. Moreover, dual AGN hosts exhibit a higher fraction of disk/large pseudo-bulge than single-AGN hosts. The Disk-to-Total ratio is approximately constant with BH mass or AGN luminosity. We also create mock images of dual AGN host galaxies, employing morphological fitting software Statmorph to calculate morphological parameters and compare them with our kinematic decomposition results. Around $83.3\pm2.4\%$ of galaxies display disk-like profiles, of which $\sim60.7\pm2.2\%$ are kinematically confirmed as disks. Se\'rsic indices and half-mass radii of dual AGN host galaxies align with observational measurements from HST at $z\sim2$. Around $34\%$ are identified as mergers from the $\text{Gini}-M_{20}$ relation. We find two dual AGN hosted by galaxies that exhibit disk-like se\'rsic index $n_{12}&lt;1$ and $(D/T)_{12}&gt;0.5$, which are in remarkable agreement with properties of recently discovered dual quasars in disk galaxies at $z\sim 2$.

  We report the time series analysis of TESS light curves of three blazars, BL Lacertae, 1RXS J111741.0+254858, and 1RXS J004519.6+212735, obtained using a customized approach for extracting AGN light curves. We find tentative evidence for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in these light curves that range from 2 to 6 days. Two methods of analysis are used for assessing their significance: generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms and weighted wavelet Z-transforms. The different approaches of these methods together ensure a robust measurement of the significance of the claimed periodicities. We can attribute the apparent QPOs to the kink instability model which postulates that the observed QPOs are related to the temporal growth of kinks in the magnetized relativistic jet. We confirm the application of this model to BL Lacertae and extend the kink instability model to the other two BL Lac objects.

  The black hole mass MBH is crucial in constraining the growth of supermassive BHs within their host galaxies. Since direct measurements of MBH with dynamical methods are restricted to a limited number of nearly quiescent nearby galaxies and a small minority of active galactic nuclei (AGN), we must rely on indirect methods. In this work, we utilize an unbiased, volume-limited, hard X-ray selected sample of AGN to compare the reliability of some commonly used indirect methods, emphasising those that can be applied to obscured AGN. Based on a subsample of AGN with MBH determined via dynamical methods, our study suggests that X-ray based techniques, such as the scaling method and the one based on the variability measured through the excess variance, are in good agreement with the dynamical methods. On the other hand, the M-sigma correlation based on inactive galaxies tends to systematically overestimate MBH, regardless of the level of obscuration. We provide a correcting factor that produces an acceptable agreement with dynamical values and can be used to quickly correct the MBH computed with this method. We also derive an alternative M-sigma correlation based on this unbiased sample of AGN with a slope considerably shallower than the ones obtained using inactive galaxies, suggesting that the latter correlation may not be appropriate to compute the MBH in AGN. Finally, we find that no quick fix can be applied to correct the MBH obtained from the fundamental plane of black hole activity, casting doubts on the reliability of this method.

  We present an improved study of the relation between supermassive black hole growth and their host galaxy properties in the local Universe (z &lt; 0.33). To this end, we build an extensive sample combining spectroscopic measurements of star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass from Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with specific Black Hole accretion rate (sBHAR, $\lambda_{\mathrm{sBHAR}} \propto L_{\mathrm{X}}/\mathcal{M}_{\ast}$) derived from the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue (3XMM-DR8) and the Chandra Source Catalogue (CSC 2.0). We find that the sBHAR probability distribution for both star-forming and quiescent galaxies has a power-law shape peaking at $\log\lambda_{\mathrm{sBHAR}}\sim -3.5$ and declining toward lower sBHAR in all stellar mass ranges. This finding confirms the decrease of AGN activity in the local Universe compared to higher redshifts. We observe a significant correlation between $\log\,\lambda_{\mathrm{sBHAR}}$ and $\log\,{\mathrm{SFR}}$ in almost all stellar mass ranges, but the relation is shallower compared to higher redshifts, indicating a reduced availability of accreting material in the local Universe. At the same time, the BHAR-to-SFR ratio for star-forming galaxies strongly correlates with stellar mass, supporting the scenario where both AGN activity and stellar formation primarily depend on the stellar mass via fuelling by a common gas reservoir. Conversely, this ratio remains constant for quiescent galaxies, possibly indicating the existence of the different physical mechanisms responsible for AGN fuelling or different accretion mode in quiescent galaxies.

  We measure the bolometric luminosity of a complete and unbiased 12 micron-selected sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe. For each galaxy we used a 10-band radio-to-X-ray Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) to isolate the genuine AGN continuum in each band, including sub-arcsecond measurements where available, and correcting those contaminated by the host galaxy. We derive the median SED of Seyfert type 1 AGN, Seyferts with hidden broad-lines (HBL), Seyferts of type 2, and LINER nuclei in our sample. The median Seyfert 1 SED shows the characteristic blue bump feature in the UV, but nevertheless the largest contribution to the bolometric luminosity comes from the IR and X-ray continua. The median SEDs of both HBL and type 2 AGN are affected by starlight contamination in the optical/UV. The median SED of HBL AGN is consistent with that of Seyfert 1's, when an extinction of Av = 1.2 mag is applied. The comprehensive SEDs allowed us to measure accurate bolometric luminosities and derive robust bolometric corrections for the different tracers. The 12 micron and the K-band nuclear luminosities have good linear correlations with the bolometric luminosity, similar to those in the X-rays. We derive bolometric corrections for either continuum bands (K-band, 12 micron, 2-10 keV and 14-195 keV) and narrow emission lines (mid-IR high ionization lines of [OIV] and [NeV] and optical [OIII]5007A) as well as for combinations of IR continuum and line emission. A combination of continuum plus line emission accurately predicts the bolometric luminosity up to quasar luminosities.

  X-ray continuum emission of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may be reflected by circumnuclear dusty tori, producing prominent fluorescence iron lines at X-ray frequencies. Here we discuss the broad-band emission of three radio-loud AGN belonging to the class of compact symmetric objects (CSOs), with detected narrow Fe\,K$\alpha$ lines. CSOs have newly-born radio jets, forming compact radio lobes with projected linear sizes of the order of a few to hundreds of parsecs. We model the radio--to--$\gamma$-ray spectra of compact lobes in J1511+0518, OQ+208, and 2021+614, which are among the nearest and the youngest CSOs known to date, and are characterized by an intrinsic X-ray absorbing column density of $N_{\rm H} &gt; 10^{23}$\,cm$^{-2}$. In addition to the archival data, we analyze the newly acquired {\it Chandra} X-ray Observatory and Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) observations, and also refine the $\gamma$-ray upper limits from the {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) monitoring. The new {\it Chandra} data exclude the presence of the extended X-ray emission components on scales larger than $1.5^{\prime \prime}$. The SMA data unveil a correlation of the spectral index of the electron distribution in the lobes and $N_{\rm H}$, which can explain the $\gamma$-ray quietness of heavily obscured CSOs. Based on our modeling, we argue that the inverse-Compton emission of compact radio lobes may account for the intrinsic X-ray continuum in all these sources. Furthermore, we propose that the observed iron lines may be produced by a reflection of the lobes' continuum from the surrounding cold dust.

  We present new 1.5-8.5 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations and 0.32-1.26 GHz Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of J0354-1340, which is the only known radio-quiet (RQ) or radio-intermediate (RI) narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy with a 100-kpc two-sided radio jet. A pc-scale one-sided jet in the southeast direction from the core emission is found in the VLBA observations, while the kpc-scale jet observed with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and GMRT is in the south-north direction. The core spectra on pc and kpc scales are presented in combination with the archival VLASS observations at 3.0 GHz and the VLA C configuration observations at 5.5 GHz. The pc-scale emission dominates the kpc-scale emission above ~ 5 GHz, and the spectrum is inverted due to synchrotron self-absorption. This indicates a compact synchrotron source with a size of ~ 0.04 pc, which is associated with either the jet base or the corona. A sub-kpc scale jet, which is unresolved on scales of ~ 3 arcsec, probably dominates the emission below ~ 5 GHz. Future radio observations can explore the jet structure between the pc and 100 kpc scales, the origin of their direction mismatch, and the pc-scale jet proper motion. It remains to be explored how common such large-scale jets are in RQ or RI AGN.
