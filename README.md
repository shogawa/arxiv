  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe, capable of regulating star formation in galaxies via radiative and mechanical feedback. While AGN feedback is well studied in host galaxies, its influence on neighbouring galaxies within the same large-scale environment remains less understood. In this work, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to examine how proximity to AGN affects star formation in nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to 2 Mpc. A control sample matched in stellar mass and local density allows us to isolate AGN-driven environmental effects, quantified through the $\Delta$SFR offset defined as the difference between a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and that of its matched controls. We find a significant and mass-dependent impact where $61\%$ of AGN-adjacent SFGs show suppressed star formation, while $39\%$ exhibit enhancement. Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the trends are statistically robust and consistent across the population. Suppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos, consistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally trigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN feedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such models can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings demonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting neighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent manner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often overlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale structures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale environmental regulation.

  We present results of optical identifications for Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) radio sources using the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). A cross-match between UNIONS and VLASS Epoch 2 catalogs yields 146,212 radio galaxies down to $r=24.5$ mag over a wide area of $\sim4,200\ \mathrm{deg^2}$. We perform g-dropout selections and find $&gt;200$ sources at $z\sim4$ optimistically. Of 63,019 sources with valid photo-$z$, 8,692 are at $z_\mathrm{photo}&gt;1$, and 1,171 are at $z_\mathrm{photo}&gt;2$. Based on spectral luminosities at 1.4 GHz using the valid photo-$z$, we identify $\sim49,000$ radio-loud AGNs (RLAGNs) with $\textit{L}_\mathrm{1.4GHz}&gt;10^{24}$ W/Hz, and all radio galaxies at $z&gt;1$ are RL. Adopting radio loudness instead, 138,266 out of 146,212 UNIONS-VLASS radio galaxies are RL. Thus, our catalog greatly increases the number counts of RLAGNs at $z&gt;1$. We further cross-match the UNIONS-VLASS catalog with LOw-Frequency ARray Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 144 MHz and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) at 1.4 GHz, yielding 101,671 UNIONS-VLASS-LoTSS, 79,638 -FIRST, and 64,672 -LoTSS-FIRST sources, respectively. This multifrequency radio dataset reveals sources of various spectral shapes, including the steep spectrum of aged populations, the peaked spectrum of young populations, and the upturned spectrum potentially associated with transient sources. The UNIONS-VLASS radio galaxies will be covered by the Euclid wide survey, offering legacy values to benefit multi-faceted studies related to RLAGNs and beyond.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by influencing the observational properties of their host galaxies. We investigate the host galaxy properties of X-ray selected AGNs, focusing on differences between obscured and unobscured AGNs, and between high-(log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$}$&gt;$0.5) and low-excitation sources (log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$$&lt;$0.5). We selected a sample of AGNs from the spectroscopic zCOSMOS survey with 0.5 $&lt; zsp &lt;$ 0.9 based on the Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagram and X-ray emission. AGNs were classified as obscured or unobscured using hydrogen column density, and as high- or low-excitation based on the [OIII]5007/H$\beta$ ratio. We analysed various AGN properties, including the hardness ratio, X-ray luminosity, emission line ratios such as the ionisation-level sensitive parameter O32=log([OIII]5007/[OII]3727), and the metallicity sensitive parameter R23=log(([OIII]5007+[OII]3727/H$\beta$), and the specific black hole accretion rate. Unobscured AGNs exhibit a more evident correlation between the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ionisation ratio and X-ray luminosity than obscured AGNs, while high-excitation obscured AGNs reach, on average, higher X-ray luminosities. Furthermore, high-excitation AGNs typically show high values of R23, suggesting low metallicities, similar to that observed in high-redshift galaxies (4 $&lt; z &lt;$ 6). We find a positive correlation between the parameters $\lambda$sBHAR and N$_H$, R23 and O32 parameters. The correlation suggests that AGNs with a high specific accretion rate have not only a higher production of high-energy photons, which ionise the surrounding medium more intensely, but are also usually associated with environments less enriched in heavy elements. These results provide insights into the complex interplay between AGN activity, host galaxy properties, and the role of obscuration in shaping galaxy evolution.

  We investigate the high-ionization, narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line in a sample of over 340 ultrahard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) drawn from the BASS project. The analysis includes measurements in individual and stacked spectra, and considers several key AGN properties such as X-ray luminosity, supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratios, and line-of-sight column density. The [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line is robustly detected in ~43% (146/341) of the AGN in our sample, with no significant trends between the detection rate and key AGN/SMBH properties. In particular, the detection rate remains high even at the highest levels of obscuration (&gt;70% for log[N_H/cm^-2] &gt; 23). On the other hand, even some of our highest signal-to-noise spectra (S/N &gt; 50) lack a robust [Ne v] detection. The typical (median) scaling ratios between [Ne v] line emission and (ultra-)hard X-ray emission in our sample are log L[Ne v]/L(14-150 keV) = -3.75 and log L[Ne v]/L(2-10 keV) = -3.36. The scatter on these scaling ratios, of ~0.5 dex, is comparable to, and indeed smaller than, what is found for other commonly used tracers of AGN radiative outputs (e.g., [O III] $\lambda$5007). Otherwise, we find no significant relations between the (relative) strength of [Ne v] and the basic AGN/SMBH properties under study, in contrast with simple expectations from models of SMBH accretion flows. Our results reaffirm the usability of [Ne v] as an AGN tracer even in highly obscured systems, including dual AGN and high redshift sources.

  Line broadening and variability are observational hallmarks of active galactic nuclei which allow us to measure supermassive black hole masses as well as constrain the geometry and kinematics of the emitting gas, with the most precise measurements requiring a degree of modeling. Two popular models of the broad-line region describe the emitting gas as either a distribution of puffed up clouds or a thin disk with strong velocity gradients. As we show in this work, key features in the reverberation mapping dataset obtained by the AGN STORM team in NGC 5548 cannot be accounted for by either simple model. In several emission lines the observed broad-line profile has a single peak yet the delay profile has a distinct double peak, strongly motivating a BLR with emission from multiple components. We demonstrate a few possibilities that may alleviate the tension and better represent the true nature of the broad-line emitting gas in NGC 5548 and beyond.

  We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases.   MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (&lt;25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material.   The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions.   Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet.   For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.
