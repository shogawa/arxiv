  We present a qualitative comparison between the host and black hole properties of radio galaxies in the MeerKAT GigaHertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration~(MIGHTEE) survey with the radio galaxy population in the SIMBA suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The MIGHTEE data includes a $\sim$1deg$^{2}$ pointing of the COSMOS field observed at 1.28GHz with the MeerKAT radio telescope and cross-matched with multi-wavelength counterparts to provide classifications of high and low excitation radio galaxies (HERGs and LERGs) along with their corresponding host properties. We compare the properties of the MIGHTEE HERGs and LERGs with that predicted by the SIMBA simulations where HERGs and LERGs are defined as radio galaxies dominated by cold or hot mode accretion respectively. We consider stellar masses $\;{M}_{*}$, star formation rates SFR, AGN bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$, and Eddington fraction $f_{\rm Edd}$, as a function of 1.4GHz radio luminosity and redshift. In both MIGHTEE and SIMBA, the properties of HERGs and LERGs are similar across all properties apart from SFRs due to differences in host cold gas content in SIMBA. We predict a population of HERGs with low $f_{\rm Edd}$ in SIMBA that are confirmed in the MIGHTEE observations and tied to the faint population at low $z$. The predictions from SIMBA with the MIGHTEE observations describe a regime where our understanding of the radio galaxy dichotomy breaks down, challenging our understanding of the role of AGN accretion and feedback in the faint population of radio galaxies.

  We investigate the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the brightest submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the COSMOS field. We utilize the bright sample of ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey (AS2COSMOS), which consists of 260 SMGs with $S_{\mathrm{870}\, \mu \mathrm{m}}=0.7\text{--}19.2\,\mathrm{mJy}$ at $z=0\text{--}6$. We perform optical to millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling for the whole sample. We identify 24 AGN-host galaxies from the SEDs. Supplemented by 23 X-ray detected AGNs (X-ray AGNs), we construct an overall sample of 40 AGN-host galaxies. The X-ray luminosity upper bounds indicate that the X-ray undetected SED-identified AGNs are likely to be nearly Compton thick or have unusually suppressed X-ray emission. From visual classification, we identify $25^{+6}_{-5}$\% of the SMGs without AGNs as major merger candidates. This fraction is almost consistent with the general galaxy population at $z\sim2$, suggesting that major mergers are not necessarily required for the enhanced star formation in SMGs. We also identify $47^{+16}_{-15}$\% of the AGN hosts as major merger candidates, which is about twice as high as that in the SMGs without AGNs. This suggests that major mergers play a key role in triggering AGN activity in bright SMGs.

  We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model feedback from Seyfert-type supermassive black hole (SMBH) jets onto galaxies with identical dark matter (DM) halos of log(M/M$_\odot$) ~ 11.8. The low mass, ~10$^6$ M$_\odot$, seed SMBHs, have been introduced when the parent DM halos have reached log(M/M$_\odot$) ~ 11, at z ~ 3.7. In a controlled experiment, we vary only the efficiency of the SMBH accretion and focus on galaxies and their immediate environment properties. Our results show that the AGN jet feedback has a substantial effect on the basic properties of Seyfert-type galaxies, such as morphology, gas fraction and distribution, star formation rate and distribution, bulge-to-disk ratio, DM halo baryon fraction, and properties of circumgalactic medium (CGM) and beyond. These have been compared to a galaxy with supernovae only feedback. We focus on the energy deposition by the jet in the ISM and IGM, and follow the expansion of the multiple jet cocoons to 2 Mpc. We find that the jet-ISM interaction gradually pushes the star formation to larger radii with increasing accretion efficiency, which results in increased mass of the outer stellar disk, which is best fit as a double-exponential disk. Furthermore, we compare our galaxies and their properties with the observed nearby Seyfert galaxies, including the scaling relations, and find a close agreement, although statistical analysis of observed Seyferts is currently missing. In a forthcoming paper, we focus on evolution of these objects at z&lt;10 and study the effect of the SMBH seeding redshift on galaxy evolution.
