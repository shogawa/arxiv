  We study active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in nearby (z&lt;0.35) galaxy clusters from the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sample using Chandra observations. This nearly unbiased mass-selected sample includes both relaxed and disturbed clusters and may reflect the entire AGN feedback cycle. We find that relaxed clusters better follow the one-to-one relation of cavity power versus cooling luminosity, while disturbed clusters display higher cavity power for a given cooling luminosity, likely reflecting a difference in cooling and feedback efficiency. Disturbed clusters are also found to contain asymmetric cavities when compared to relaxed clusters, hinting toward the influence of the intracluster medium (ICM) weather on the distribution and morphology of the cavities. Disturbed clusters do not have fewer cavities than relaxed clusters, suggesting that cavities are difficult to disrupt. Thus, multiple cavities are a natural outcome of recurrent AGN outbursts. As in previous studies, we confirm that clusters with short central cooling times, tcool, and low central entropy values, K0, contain warm ionized (10000 K) or cold molecular (&lt;100 K) gas, consistent with ICM cooling and a precipitation/chaotic cold accretion (CCA) scenario. We analyzed archival MUSE observations that are available for 18 clusters. In 11/18 of the cases, the projected optical line emission filaments appear to be located beneath or around the cavity rims, indicating that AGN feedback plays an important role in forming the warm filaments by likely enhancing turbulence or uplift. In the remaining cases (7/18), the clusters either lack cavities or their association of filaments with cavities is vague, suggesting alternative turbulence-driven mechanisms (sloshing/mergers) or physical time delays are involved.

  Despite the increasing number of Gravitational Wave (GW) detections, the astrophysical origin of Binary Black Hole (BBH) mergers remains elusive. A promising formation channel for BBHs is inside accretion discs around supermassive black holes, that power Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In this paper, we test for the first time the spatial correlation between observed GW events and AGN. To this end, we assemble all sky catalogues with 1,412 (242) AGN with a bolometric luminosity greater than $10^{45.5} {\rm erg\ s}^{-1}$ ($10^{46}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$) with spectroscopic redshift of $z\leq0.3$ from the Milliquas catalogue, version 7.7b. These AGN are cross-matched with localisation volumes of BBH mergers observed in the same redshift range by the LIGO and Virgo interferometers during their third observing run. We find that the fraction of the detected mergers originated in AGN brighter than $10^{45.5}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ ($10^{46}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$) cannot be higher than $0.74$ ($0.33$) at a 95 per cent credibility level. Our upper limits imply a limited BBH merger production efficiency of the brightest AGN, while most or all GW events may still come from lower luminosity ones. Alternatively, the AGN formation path for merging stellar-mass BBHs may be actually overall subdominant in the local Universe. To our knowledge, ours are the first observational constraints on the fractional contribution of the AGN channel to the observed BBH mergers.
