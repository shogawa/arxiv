  PG0043+039 has been identified as an extremely X-ray-weak quasar and as a peculiar broad-absorption-line quasar based on UV HST spectra. We took simultaneous deep X-ray observations of PG0043+039 with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, UV spectra with the HST, and optical spectra with the HET telescope in 2022. PG0043+039 was an extreme low-X-ray-luminosity quasar in 2022. This AGN showed an extreme steep alpha_oX value of -2.47. The X-ray luminosity was a factor of 3.4 higher in the meantime in 2013. The optical and UV continuum only decreased by a factor of 1.3 - 1.5 from 2013 to 2022. Very strong emission-line intensity variations by factors of eight or more were observed in the OVI_1038 and SiIV_1403 lines between 2013 and 2022. The other UV emission lines such as Ly_alpha only decreased by a factor of 1.4. We derived a black hole mass of M=6.95*10^{8} M_solar (based on H_beta). This corresponds to an Eddington ratio of L/L_edd = 0.115. PG0043+039 exhibits strong and broad absorption lines in the UV. The highly ionized absorption lines show the largest velocity blueshifts in their broad absorption lines. The PV absorption is very strong, with equivalent widths of 7 - 10 AA. PG0043+039 shows strong Ly_alpha emission despite strong PV absorption. All the strong absorption-line troughs in the UV varied in unison in velocity space back and forward (-2000.+-300.kms-1, +2740.+-200.kms-1) without any major changes in absorption strength or in their profiles for the years 1991, 2013, and 2022. We found no general correlations of X-ray/opt/UV continuum variations with the broad absorption line variations. However, based on the simultaneous UV and X-ray observations - taken in 2013 and 2022 - we see higher maximum velocities of the blueshifted broad absorption lines in the UV when the X-ray flux was lower.

  We present measurements of the dusty torus sizes of 51 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a redshift of $z&lt;$ 0.8. Our analysis utilizes about 16 years of optical photometric data of 146 AGNs from various time-domain surveys, including ASAS-SN, CRTS, and ZTF, along with 14 years of infrared data in the $W$1 ($\sim$ 3.4 $\mu$m) and $W$2 ($\sim$ 4.6 $\mu$m) bands obtained from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The estimated dust torus size ranges from 1000 to 3000 days, using both the cross-correlation analysis and lightcurve modeling through `MICA'. The measured lag has been corrected by $(1+z)^{-0.37}$, to account for cosmological time dilation and the torus temperature-gradient scaling. We conduct a linear regression analysis for both the $W$1 and $W$2 bands to examine the radius--luminosity ($R$--$L_{BOL}$) relationship under two conditions: one where the slope is fixed at 0.5 and one where it is allowed to vary. For the fixed slope of 0.5, we find the ratio of R$_{\mathrm{BLR}}$: R$_{W1}$: R$_{W2}$ to be 1: 9: 12, indicating that the torus lies outside the BLR and that its size increases with wavelength. Furthermore, we determine the relationship between torus size and L$_{BOL}$, yielding best-fit slopes of $0.413\pm0.047$ for the $W$1 band and $0.397\pm0.058$ for the $W$2 band. Both slopes are shallower than predicted by the dust radiation equilibrium model. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the torus size systematically decreases as the Eddington ratio increases, a trend that can be explained by the self-shadowing effects of slim disks.

  We aim to spectroscopically confirm the nature of VVV-J181258.71-314346.7, a candidate counterpart to the unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGLJ1812.8-3144. This object was selected based on its near-infrared photometric properties and moderate variability, as part of a broader effort to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) behind the Galactic bulge and disc. We obtained near-infrared spectra using the Flamingos-2 instrument at Gemini South, covering the $1.1 $--$ 1.8~\mu$m range with a spectral resolution of $R \sim 1200$. Standard data reduction procedures were applied, including telluric correction and wavelength calibration. The analysis focused on the identification of emission lines and the estimation of the redshift using cross-correlation techniques and spectral template fitting. Despite a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, the spectrum reveals the presence of Pa$\beta$ and Fe\,\textsc{ii} emission lines. The measured redshift is $z = 0.206 \pm 0.001$, which confirms the extragalactic nature of the source. The spectral features such as line ratios and full width at half maximum are consistent with those typically observed in type-1 AGNs, particularly Seyfert 1 galaxies. This study demonstrates the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy to reveal AGNs that are obscured by highly extincted and crowded galactic fields. The confirmation of an AGN at low Galactic latitude ($b\sim -6.5${\deg}) shows that near-IR surveys like VVV can successfully penetrate the zone of avoidance. Extending this approach to additional candidates is crucial for improving the census of AGNs hidden behind the Milky Way, as well as for constraining the population of unassociated gamma-ray sources in these troublesome regions.

  Recent near- and mid-infrared (IR) observations reveal the existence of appreciable amounts of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust in the harsh environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the origins of which are still under discussion. In this paper, we analyze the near-IR spectra of AGNs obtained with AKARI to systematically study the properties of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust a ected by the AGN activity. We perform the spectral fitting and the spectral energy distribution fitting for our sample of 102 AGNs to obtain the fluxes of the aromatic and aliphatic spectral features, the total IR luminosity (L_IR), and the fractional luminosity of AGN components (L_AGN/L_IR). As a result, we find that L_aromatic/L_IR is systematically lower for the AGN sample, especially much lower for AGNs with the aliphatic feature seen in the absorption, than for star-forming galaxies (SFGs), while L_aliphatic/L_aromatic is systematically higher for the AGN sample than for the SFG sample, increasing with the AGN activity indicated by L_AGN/L_IR. In addition, the profiles of the aliphatic emission features of the AGN sample are significantly di erent from those of the SFG sample in that the AGNs have the feature intensities systematically stronger at longer wavelengths. We conclude that both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust are likely of circumnuclear origins, suggesting that a significant amount of the aliphatic hydrocarbon dust may come from a new population created through processes such as shattering of large carbonaceous grains by AGN outflows.

  Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of massive galaxies at ages below 1 Gyr pose a challenge to standard models of galaxy formation, which predict significantly longer assembly timescales. One possible explanation is that active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive large scale outflows that accelerate galaxy growth. To test this scenario in the local Universe, we analyzed Gaia DR3 data for stars within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, computing galactocentric radial velocities (v_radial_gc) in 27 spatial sectors covering the entire Galaxy, with radial binning of 0.25 kpc. Coordinate transformations and velocity calculations were performed using the Astropy library. We find that 21 of 27 sectors exhibit statistically significant outward motions of 3-50 km/s, while one quadrant shows negative velocities, likely related to the configuration of an activity zone and/or the Galactic bar. Both disk and halo populations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s (p&lt;0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where globular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and axisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5 kpc. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Milky Way exhibits measurable central expansion, potentially reflecting AGN-driven feedback. This interpretation departs from standard theory and should be regarded as preliminary, requiring further study. However, if confirmed, such expansion could provide a natural explanation for the rapid appearance of massive galaxies observed by JWST.

  The XMM-Newton X-ray observatory has played a prominent role in astrophysics, conducting precise and thorough observations of the X-ray sky for the past two decades. The most recent iteration of the 4XMM catalogue and one of its latest data releases DR11 mark significant improvements over previous XMM-Newton catalogues, serving as a cornerstone for comprehending the diverse inhabitants of the X-ray sky. We employ detections and spectra extracted from the 4XMM-DR11 catalogue, subjecting them to fitting procedures using simple models. Our study operates within the framework of the XMM2ATHENA project, which focuses on developing state-of-the-art methods that exploit existing XMM-Newton data. We introduce and publicly release four catalogues containing measurements derived from X-ray spectral modelling of sources. The first catalogue encompasses outcomes obtained by fitting an absorbed power law model to all the extracted spectra for individual detections within the 4XMM-DR11 dataset. The second catalogue presents results obtained by fitting both an absorbed power law and an absorbed blackbody model to all unique physical sources listed in the 4XMM-DR11s catalogue, which documents source detection results from overlapping XMM-Newton observations. For the third catalogue we use the five band count rates derived from the pipe line detection of X-ray sources to mimic low resolution spectra to get a rough estimate of the spectral shape (absorbed power-law) of all 4XMM-DR11 detections. In the fourth catalogue, we conduct spectral analyses for the subset of identified sources with extracted spectra, employing various models based on their classification into categories such as AGN, stars, X-ray binaries, and cataclysmic variables. The scientific potential of these catalogues is highlighted by discussing the capabilities of optical and mid-infrared colours for selecting absorbed AGN. (abridged)
