  Understanding the nature of high-$z$ dusty galaxies requires a comprehensive view of their ISM and molecular complexity. However, the molecular ISM at high redshifts is commonly studied using only a few species beyond CO, limiting our understanding of the ISM in these objects. In this paper, we present the results of deep 3 mm spectral line surveys using the NOEMA targeting two lensed dusty galaxies: APM 08279+5255 (APM), a quasar at redshift $z=3.911$, and NCv1.143 (NC), a $z=3.565$ starburst galaxy. The spectral line surveys cover rest-frame frequencies from about 330-550 GHz. We report the detection of 38 and 25 emission lines in APM and NC, respectively. The spectra reveal the chemical richness and the complexity of the physical properties of the ISM. By comparing the spectra of the two sources and combining the gas excitation analysis, we find that the physical properties and the chemical imprints of the ISM are different between them: the molecular gas is more excited in APM, exhibiting higher molecular-gas temperatures and densities compared to NC; the chemical abundances in APM are akin to the values of local AGN, showing boosted relative abundances of the dense gas tracers that might be related to high-temperature chemistry and/or XDRs, while NC more closely resembles local starburst galaxies. The most significant differences are found in H2O, where the 448 GHz H2O line is significantly brighter in APM, likely linked to the intense far-infrared radiation from the dust powered by AGN. Our astrochemical model suggests that, at such high column densities, UV radiation is less important in regulating the ISM, while CRs (and/or X-rays and shocks) are the key players in shaping the abundance of the molecules. Such deep spectral line surveys open a new window to study the physical and chemical properties of the ISM and the radiation field of galaxies in the early Universe. (abridged)
