  We report the results of high-resolution 5 GHz Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network observations of 36 nearby galaxies, an extension of the Legacy e-MERLIN Multi-band Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (LeMMINGs) survey. Our sample includes 21 low ionization nuclear emission regions (LINERs), 4 Seyferts, 3 absorption line galaxies (ALGs), and 8 HII galaxies. We achieved an unprecedented detection rate, successfully imaging 23 out of 36 sources with a detection threshold of $\sim$20 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The radio sizes are typically of $\leq$ 5 pc. Core identification was achieved in 16 sources, while 7 others were identified as core candidates. Radio luminosities of the sample range from 10$\rm ^{34}$ to 10$\rm ^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Our analysis reveals a predominance of compact core structures, with ten sources exhibiting a one-sided core jet morphology and NGC 2146 exhibiting a rare two-sided jet structure. The study advances our understanding of the compactness of radio sources at various scales, indicating a core-dominated nature in all but one galaxy NGC2655. We find moderate to strong correlations between radio luminosity, black hole mass, optical [O III] line luminosity, and hard X-ray luminosity, suggesting a common active galactic nucleus (AGN) core origin. These results provide new insights into the fundamental plane of black hole activity and support the role of the synchrotron process in Low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) radio emission.
