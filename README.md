  The dense and gaseous environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can catalyze repeated mergers of stellar-mass black holes (BHs), potentially explaining the high-mass tail of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). We present a semi-analytical population synthesis framework that captures key physical processes in AGN disks, including gas capture, migration, binary pair-up, gas hardening, and dynamical binary-single interactions. Our simulations show that AGN disks can produce hierarchical mergers, especially near migration traps, and may contribute to the high-mass, high-spin BBH population. This work opens prospects for constraining both the AGN channel and supermassive black hole growth with future gravitational-wave detections.

  We present a pseudo-Newtonian stationary circumbinary slim disk model. We extend the slim disk formalism by including the binary tidal torque and solve the resulting steady-state equations to determine the circumbinary disk structure. We compare the binary slim disk solutions with corresponding binary thin disk solutions, calculate the disk spectrum, explore the impact of different parameters on the system, and estimate the binary shrinkage timescale. We find that; (1) due to the different disk density profiles, the integrated tidal torque exerted on the disk is significantly smaller for the slim disk than for the thin disk; as a result thin disks onto binary black holes can be radiatively significantly more efficient than slim disks; (2) The presence of the secondary alters the emission of the circumbinary disk, making it different from the spectrum of a single black hole Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN); (3) The tidal torque boosts the viscous torque in the outer part of the disk (radii greater than the binary separation), which is strongly dependent on the disk parameters, including the binary mass ratio $q$, the orbital separation $a$, the viscous parameter $\alpha$ and the accretion rate $\dot M$; (4) The vertical component of the potential of the secondary slightly decreases the integrated tidal torque. However, both the vertical and radial components of the potential of the secondary have small impact on the disk radiative flux; (5) Using the integrated disk tidal torque backreacting on the secondary at different orbital separations, we find that the disk provides an efficient way to shrink the binary orbital separation.
