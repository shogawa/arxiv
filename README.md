  We present an analysis of the first two XRISM/Resolve spectra of the well-known Seyfert-1.5 active galactic nucleus in NGC 4151, obtained in December 2023. Our work focuses on the nature of the narrow Fe K$_{\alpha}$ emission line at 6.4 keV, the strongest and most common X-ray line observed in AGN. The total line is found to consist of three components. Even the narrowest component of the line is resolved with evident Fe K$_{\alpha,1}$ (6.404 keV) and K$_{\alpha,2}$ (6.391 keV) contributions in a 2:1 flux ratio, fully consistent with neutral gas with negligible bulk velocity. Subject to the limitations of our models, the narrowest and intermediate-width components are consistent with emission from optically thin gas, suggesting that they arise in a disk atmosphere and/or wind. Modeling the three line components in terms of Keplerian broadening, they are readily associated with (1) the inner wall of the ``torus,'' (2) the innermost optical ``broad line region'' (or, ``X-ray BLR''), and (3) a region with a radius of $r\simeq 100~GM/c^{2}$ that may signal a warp in the accretion disk. Viable alternative explanations of the broadest component include a fast wind component and/or scattering; however, we find evidence of variability in the narrow Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line complex on time scales consistent with small radii. The best-fit models are statistically superior to simple Voigt functions, but when fit with Voigt profiles the time-averaged lines are consistent with a projected velocity broadening of FWHM$=1600^{+400}_{-200}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$. Overall, the resolution and sensitivity of XRISM show that the narrow Fe K line in AGN is an effective probe of all key parts of the accretion flow, as it is currently understood. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of AGN accretion, future studies with XRISM, and X-ray-based black hole mass measurements.

  Supermassive Black Holes (BHs) are known to efficiently grow through gas accretion, but even sustained and intense mass build-up through this mechanism struggles to explain the assembly of the most massive BHs observed in the local Universe. Using the Chandra Deep-Wide Field Survey (CDFWS) in the Bo\"otes field, we measure BH-galaxy assembly in massive galaxies ($M_\star\gtrsim10^{10}\, \rm M_\odot$) through the AGN fraction and specific Black Hole accretion rate (sBHAR) distribution as a function of redshift and stellar mass. We determine stellar masses and star formation rates for a parent sample of optically selected galaxies as well as those with X-ray detections indicating the presence of an AGN through Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. We derive a redshift-dependent mass completeness limit and extract X-ray information for every galaxy as to identify AGN in various types of galaxies at low and high redshift providing a comprehensive picture of the AGN population in massive galaxies. While X-ray AGN samples are dominated by moderately massive host galaxies of $M_{\star} \geqslant 10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, we do not find a strong stellar mass dependence in AGN fraction (to limits in sBHAR) or sBHAR distribution above this mass threshold, indicating a bias towards massive galaxies in the observed samples. A mild increase in AGN fraction is seen towards high stellar mass for low sBHAR AGN, as well as a suppression of high sBHAR events in the most massive galaxies. We derive BH-galaxy growth tracks over time, which reveal that while most BH mass has been accumulated since $z=4$ for lower mass BHs, the assembly of the most massive BHs is more complex, with little to no relative mass gain since $z=4$, implying that rapid and intense growth episodes prior to $z=4$ were necessary to form these massive BHs.

  We report the evidence of a hidden black hole (BH) in a low-mass galaxy, MaNGA 9885-9102, and provide a new method to identify active BH in low mass galaxies. This galaxy is originally selected from the MaNGA survey with distinctive bipolar H$\alpha$ blobs at the minor axis. The bipolar feature can be associated with AGN activity, while the two blobs are classified as the H II regions on the BPT diagram, making the origins confusing. The Swift UV continuum shows that the two blobs do not have UV counterparts, suggesting that the source of ionization is out of the blobs. Consistent with this, the detailed photoionization models prefer to AGN rather than star-forming origin with a significance of 5.8$\sigma$. The estimated BH mass is $M_{\rm BH}\sim$7.2$\times 10^5 M_\odot$ from the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relationship. This work introduces a novel method for detecting the light echo of BHs, potentially extending to intermediate mass, in low metallicity environments where the traditional BPT diagram fails.
