  The exponential growth of astronomical data from large-scale surveys has created both opportunities and challenges for the astrophysics community. This paper explores the possibilities offered by transfer learning techniques in addressing these challenges across various domains of astronomical research. We present a set of recent applications of transfer learning methods for astronomical tasks based on the usage of a pre-trained convolutional neural networks. The examples shortly discussed include the detection of candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN), the possibility of deriving physical parameters for galaxies directly from images, the identification of artifacts in time series images, and the detection of strong lensing candidates and outliers. We demonstrate how transfer learning enables efficient analysis of complex astronomical phenomena, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This kind of method will be very helpful for upcoming large-scale surveys like the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). By showcasing successful implementations and discussing methodological approaches, we highlight the versatility and effectiveness of such techniques.

  The Virgo cluster is the closest richest nearby galaxy cluster. It is in the formation process, with a number of sub-clusters undergoing merging and interactions. Although a great laboratory to study galaxy evolution and cluster formation, its large apparent size and the severe dynamic range limitations due to the presence of the bright radio source Virgo A (M 87) reduced the ability of past wide-area radio surveys to image the region with high sensitivity and fidelity. In this paper we describe the "Virgo Cluster multi-Telescope Observations in Radio of Interacting galaxies and AGN" (ViCTORIA) project. The survey and its data reduction strategy are designed to mitigate the challenges of this field and deliver: images from 42 MHz to 1.7 GHz frequencies of the Virgo cluster, about 60 times deeper than existing data, in full polarisation, and including a blind HI survey that aims at mapping seven times more galaxies than previous experiments and without selection biases. Data have been collected with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) and with MeerKAT in L-band, including polarisation and enough frequency resolution to conduct local HI studies. At the distance of Virgo, current radio instruments have the resolution to probe scales of ~500 pc and the sensitivity to study dwarf galaxies, the most fragile systems given their shallow gravitational potential wells, making Virgo a unique laboratory to study galaxy evolution and AGN feedback in a rich environment. In this work, we present some preliminary results, including high resolution images of the radio emission surrounding M 87, that show that the lobes are filled with filamentary structures. The combination of the presented radio surveys with state-of-the-art optical, UV, X-ray surveys will massively increase the scientific output from the studies of the Virgo cluster, making the ViCTORIA Project's legacy value outstanding.

  The detailed feeding and feedback mechanisms of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are not yet well known. For low-luminosity and obscured AGN, as well as late-type galaxies, determining the central black hole (BH) masses is challenging. Our goal with the GATOS sample is to study circum-nuclear regions and better estimate BH masses with more precision than scaling relations offer. Using ALMA's high spatial resolution, we resolve CO(3-2) emissions within ~100 pc around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in seven GATOS galaxies to estimate their BH masses when sufficient gas is present. We study seven bright ($L_{AGN}(14-150\mathrm{keV}) \geq 10^{42}\mathrm{erg/s}$), nearby (&lt;28 Mpc) galaxies from the GATOS core sample. For comparison, we searched the literature for previous BH mass estimates and made additional calculations using the \mbh~ - $\sigma$ relation and the fundamental plane of BH activity. We developed a supervised machine learning method to estimate BH masses from position-velocity diagrams or first-moment maps using ALMA CO(3-2) observations. Numerical simulations with a wide range of parameters created the training, validation, and test sets. Seven galaxies provided enough gas for BH mass estimations: NGC4388, NGC5506, NGC5643, NGC6300, NGC7314, NGC7465, and NGC~7582. Our BH masses, ranging from 6.39 to 7.18 log$(M_{BH}/M_\odot)$, align with previous estimates. Additionally, our machine learning method provides robust error estimations with confidence intervals and offers greater potential than scaling relations. This work is a first step toward an automated \mbh estimation method using machine learning.

  We investigate the internal and external mechanisms that regulate and quench star formation (SF) in galaxies at $z \sim 0.3$ using MAGPI observations and the EAGLE, Magneticum, and IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. Using SimSpin to generate mock observations of simulated galaxies, we match detection/resolution limits in star formation rates and stellar mass, along with MAGPI observational details including the average point spread function and pixel scale. While we find a good agreement in the slope of the global star-forming main sequence (SFMS) between MAGPI observations and all three simulations, the slope of the resolved SFMS does not agree within 1 $-$ 2$\sigma$. Furthermore, in radial SF trends, good agreement between observations and simulations exists only for galaxies far below the SFMS, where we capture evidence for inside-out quenching. The simulations overall agree with each other between $\sim1.5-4 \ R_{\rm e}$ but show varying central suppression within $R \sim 1.5 \ R_{\rm e}$ for galaxies on and below the SFMS, attributable to different AGN feedback prescriptions. All three simulations show similar dependencies of SF radial trends with environment. Central galaxies are subject to both internal and external mechanisms, showing increased SF suppression in the centre with increasing halo mass, indicating AGN feedback. Satellite galaxies display increasing suppression in the outskirts as halo mass increases, indicative of environmental processes. These results demonstrate the power of spatially resolved studies of galaxies; while global properties align, radial profiles reveal discrepancies between observations and simulations and their underlying physics.

  Cosmic rays (CRs) can significantly impact dense molecular clouds in galaxies, heating the interstellar medium (ISM) and altering its chemistry, ionization, and thermal properties. Their influence is particularly relevant in environments with high CR rates, such as starburst galaxies with supernova remnants or jets and outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGN). CRs transfer energy to the ionized phase of the ISM far from the ionization source, preventing gas cooling and driving large-scale winds. In this work, we use CLOUDY to explore the effect of CRs on nebular gas, a relatively underexplored area, mainly focused on cold molecular gas. Our models cover a broad range of density ($1 - 10^4\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$), ionization parameter ($-3.5 \leq \log U \leq -1.5$), and CR ionization rate ($10^{-16}\, \rm{s^{-1}} - 10^{-12}\, \rm{s^{-1}}$). These are compared to MUSE observations of two AGN, Centaurus A and NGC 1068, and the starburst NGC 253. We find that CR rates $\gtrsim 10^{-13}\, \rm{s^{-1}}$, typical of AGN and strong starburst galaxies, can significantly alter the thermal structure of the ionized gas by forming a deep secondary low-ionization layer beyond the photoionization-dominated region. This enhances emission from low-ionization transitions, such as [\ion{N}{ii}], [\ion{S}{ii}], and [\ion{O}{i}], affecting line-ratio diagnostics, metallicity, and ionization estimates. Unlike pure photoionization models, AGN simulations with high CR ionization rates reproduce the Seyfert loci in BPT diagrams without requiring super-solar metallicities for the narrow-line region. Additionally, star formation simulations with high CR ionization rates can explain line ratios in the LINER domain. We propose new maximum starburst boundaries for BPT diagrams to distinguish regions dominated by AGN photoionization from those that could be explained by star formation plus high CR ionization rates.
