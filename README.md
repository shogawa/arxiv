  It is established that the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray emissions in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are tightly correlated. This correlation is observed both in low- and high-redshift sources. In particular, observations of large samples of quasars revealed the presence of a non-linear correlation between UV and X-rays. The physical origin of this correlation is poorly understood. In this work, we explore this observed correlation in the framework of the X-ray illumination of the accretion disc by a central source. We have shown in previous works that this model successfully explains the continuum UV/optical time delays, variability, and the broadband spectral energy distribution in AGN. We use this model to produce $150,000$ model SEDs assuming a uniform distribution of model parameters. We compute the corresponding UV ($ 2500~\r{A} $) and X-ray (2 keV) monochromatic luminosities and select only the model data points that agree with the observed UV-to-X-ray correlation. Our results show that the X-ray illumination of accretion disc model can reproduce the observed correlation for a subset of model configurations with a non-uniform distribution of black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$), accretion rate ($\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$), and power transferred from the accretion disc to the corona ($L_{\rm transf}/L_{\rm disc}$). In addition, our results reveal the presence of a correlation between $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$, and between $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\rm transf}/L_{\rm disc}$, to explain the observed X-ray-UV correlation. We also present evidence based on observed luminosities supporting our findings. We finally discuss the implications of our results.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that challenge existing black hole (BH) formation models. These newly observed BHs are overmassive compared to the host galaxies and have an unexpectedly high abundance. Their exact origin remains elusive. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the formation of massive BH seeds in dense Population III (Pop III) star clusters. Using a cosmological simulation of Pop III cluster formation, we present models for the assembly and subsequent evolution of these clusters. The models account for background gas potential, stellar collisions and associated mass loss, gas accretion, stellar growth, their initial mass function (IMF), and subsequent star formation. We conduct $N$-body simulations of these models over a span of 2 million years. Our results show that BHs of $&gt; 400$ M$_\odot$ are formed in all cases, reaching up to $\sim 5000$ M$_\odot$ under optimistic yet reasonable conditions and potentially exceeding 10$^4$ M$_\odot$ provided that high accretion rates of 10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ onto the stars can be sustained. We conclude that massive BHs can be formed in Pop III stellar clusters and are likely to remain within their host clusters. These BHs may experience further growth as they sink into the galaxy's potential well. This formation channel should be given further consideration in models of galaxy formation and BH demographics.

  The origin of radio emission in radio-quiet (RQ) AGN remains a long-standing mystery. We present a detailed study of the cm to sub-mm emission from the nucleus of the nearby prototypical RQ Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC 1068. We analyse observations between 4.5-706 GHz using $e$-MERLIN, VLA and ALMA. We restricted all data used for imaging to a matching $uv-$range of 15$-$3300 k$\lambda$, to ensure that all data sampled the same spatial scales. All images were restored with a $\sim$ 0.06$''$ beam. To derive the spectral energy distribution (SED), we fit synchrotron, free-free, dust and coronal component models to these data. We report that the sub-mm excess between $\sim$ 200-700 GHz is consistent with synchrotron emission from a compact and optically thick corona with a radius $R_\mathrm{c}\approx 70\pm5 \,R_\mathrm{g}$, a fraction of $\sim$\,$10\pm2$% of the energy density in the form of non-thermal electrons, and a magnetic field strength $B\approx 148$ G. The luminosity of the corona is roughly consistent with -- though higher than -- the expected from mm--X-ray correlations derived in recent studies of RQ AGN. This difference is likely due to the corona SED peaking at ($\approx$550 GHz). Between 10 and $\sim$ 200 GHz, the SED is dominated by free-free emission. High angular resolution observations at frequencies below 5 GHz are needed to constrain a putative optically thin synchrotron component and the amount of free-free absorption.

  We present $4-12$ GHz in-band spectral energy distributions with accompanying 6 GHz and 10 GHz imaging results for a volume-complete sample ($&lt;40$ Mpc) of hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in its A-array configuration. Despite expectations, only 12 out of 25 of these targets have been detected by the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at milliarcsecond resolution in our previous studies, and we aim to understand the nature of why the circumnuclear radio emission resolves away at the subparsec spatial scales. We find that the sources not detected by the VLBA are also the faintest sources observed with the VLA. We explore the spectral structure derived from the nuclear emission and measure a mean spectral index of $\langle\alpha\rangle=-0.69$ with a scatter of $\sigma_\alpha=0.18$ for the sources not detected by the VLBA, indicative of optically thin synchrotron emission. The 12 sources detected by the VLBA primarily have flat ($-0.5\leq\alpha\leq0.0$) or inverted ($\alpha&gt;0$) spectral indices. Nine of the sources have statistically significant curvature, with only one that was not detected by the VLBA. In NGC~3079, we model an approximately flat spectrum for the excess emission observed by the VLA that is likely produced entirely beyond parsec spatial scales.

  From the scale-free nature of gravity, the structure in the universe is expected to be self-similar on large scales. However, this self-similarity will eventually break down due to small-scale gas physics such as star formation, AGN and stellar feedback as well as non-linear effects gaining importance relative to linear structure formation. In this work we investigate the large-scale matter flows that connect collapsed structures to their cosmic environments specifically for their agreement with self-similarity in various properties. For this purpose we use the full power of the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation suite Magneticum Pathfinder to calculate the in- and outflow rates for haloes on a large range of masses and redshifts. We find a striking self-similarity across the whole mass range and cosmic epochs that only breaks in the outflowing regime due to the different outflow driving mechanisms for galaxies vs. galaxy clusters. Geometrical analysis of the patterns of in vs. outflow demonstrate how the inflows organize into anisotropic filaments driven by the tidal environment, while the outflows are isotropic due to their thermal nature. This also manifests in the thermal and chemical properties of the gas: While the inflowing gas is pristine and colder, encountering the accretion shocks and entering the influence region of AGN and stellar feedback heats the gas up into a diffuse, metal enriched and hot atmosphere. Overall the differences between outflowing and infalling gas are enhanced at the galaxy cluster scale compared to the galaxy scale due to the accretion shocks that reach out to large radii for these objects. An individual study of the gas motions in the outskirts of one of the most massive clusters in the simulations illustrates these results: Gas found in the outer hot atmosphere at z=0 falls in and is completely enriched early before being shock heated and expanding.

  Understanding the AGN-galaxy co-evolution, feedback processes, and the evolution of Black Hole Accretion rate Density (BHAD) requires accurately estimating the contribution of obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, detecting these sources is challenging due to significant extinction at the wavelengths typically used to trace their emission. We evaluate the capabilities of the proposed far-infrared observatory PRIMA and its synergies with the X-ray observatory NewAthena in detecting AGN and in measuring the BHAD. Starting from X-ray background synthesis models, we simulate the performance of NewAthena and of PRIMA in Deep and Wide surveys. Our results show that the combination of these facilities is a powerful tool for selecting and characterising all types of AGN. While NewAthena is particularly effective at detecting the most luminous, the unobscured, and the moderately obscured AGN, PRIMA excels at identifying heavily obscured sources, including Compton-thick AGN (of which we expect 7500 detections per deg$^2$). We find that PRIMA will detect 60 times more sources than Herschel over the same area and will allow us to accurately measure the BHAD evolution up to z=8, better than any current IR or X-ray survey, finally revealing the true contribution of Compton-thick AGN to the BHAD evolution.

  We present a comprehensive analysis of the extended emission line region (EELR) in the host galaxy of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019qiz, utilizing VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy. The high spatial-resolution data reveal a bi-conical emission structure approximately $3.7~\mathrm{kpc}$ in scale within the galactic center, characterized by a prominent [OIII] line in the nucleus and significant [NII] line emission extending into the EELR. Spectral analysis of the EELR indicates line ratios consistent with Seyfert ionization in the center and LINER-type ionization in the outer diffuse region, suggesting ionization from galactic nuclear activity. The required ionizing luminosity, estimated from the H$\rm{\alpha}$ and H$\rm{\beta}$ luminosities based on the photoionization and recombination balance assumption, is $10^{41.8}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for all spaxels classified as AGN, and $10^{40.7}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for spaxels in the central $0.9~\mathrm{kpc}$ Seyfert region. However, the current bolometric luminosity of the nucleus $L_{\text{bol}} \leq 10^{40.8}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, estimated from quiescent-state soft X-ray observations, is insufficient to ionize the entire EELR, implying a recently faded AGN or a delayed response to historical activity. Stellar population analysis reveals a post-starburst characteristic in the EELR, and the gas kinematics show disturbances and non-circular components compared to the stellar kinematics. Notably, the recent detection of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) in the X-ray light curve of AT2019qiz confirms the TDE-QPE association. Our findings provide direct evidence for an AGN-like EELR in the host galaxy of the nearest TDE with QPE detection, offering new insights into the complex interplay between TDEs, QPEs, AGN activity, and host galaxy evolution.

  (Abridged) The identification of AGN and SB regions in galaxies is crucial for understanding the role of various physical processes in galaxy evolution. Molecular line ratios, such as the HCN/HCO+ ratio, have been proposed as potential tracers of these distinct environments. This paper aims to assess the reliability of the HCN/HCO+ ratio, from J = 1-0 to J = 4-3 transitions, as a diagnostic tool for differentiating AGN and SB activity across a diverse sample of nearby galaxies. We focus on evaluating the effect of spatial resolution on the robustness of these ratios and investigate the underlying physical conditions that drive observed variations. We compile observations of HCN and HCO+ lines across multiple J transitions from various sources, covering different galaxy types, including Seyferts, starbursts, and (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). The observations span spatial scales from cloud-sized regions to kiloparsec scales. We analyse the behaviour of these ratios at varying resolutions and employ non-LTE radiative transfer models to infer the physical conditions that drive the observed ratios. We find that the HCN/HCO+ ratio from higher J transitions can differentiate between AGN and SB activity when observed at high spatial resolution. This distinction occurs around unity. However, at lower resolutions, contamination from multiple emission sources and beam averaging effects destroy these distinctions. Modelling suggests that elevated HCN/HCO+ ratios in AGN-dominated regions are largely driven by an enhancement in HCN abundance relative to HCO+, likely due to high-temperature chemistry or increased excitation. Our study confirms that the HCN/HCO+ ratio, particularly of higher J transitions, can be a reliable tracer of AGN versus SB activity if observations are conducted at sufficiently high spatial resolution.

  Galaxy groups represent a significant fraction of the halo population, playing a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution. However, their detection in X-rays remains challenging, raising questions about the physical mechanisms driving their detectability in current surveys.   Using the Magneticum simulations, we construct a mock X-ray lightcone of the local Universe ($z&lt;0.2$) to investigate the selection function of galaxy groups and clusters. We find that AGN activity is a key driver of baryon depletion, but late-time mergers boost X-ray brightness by replenishing the gas reservoir in the halos, highlighting the interplay between feedback processes and the environment. Our analysis shows that X-ray bright groups experience sustained late-time mass accretion, maintaining higher gas fractions and fueling the central supermassive black holes (SMBH), further increasing the X-ray emissivity in the core. In contrast, X-ray faint groups form earlier and lose most of their gas over time, resembling fossil groups.   Magneticum predicts strong anti-correlations between gas fraction (or X-ray luminosity) and SMBH mass, stellar mass (both in the central galaxy and intracluster light), and group richness at fixed halo mass. We derive predictions on the hot gas fraction at fixed halos mass (e.g. a group of total mass $M_{500}=10^{13} M_{\odot}$ can have hot gas fractions in the range $f_\mathrm{gas}=0.02-0.06$ and a central SMBH with a median mass of $M_\mathrm{BH}=10^9 M_{\odot}$ and a scatter of $0.5$ dex) compatible with the most recent measurements of the baryonic fraction. These findings will aid the interpretation of future X-ray surveys, demonstrating the power of simulation-based inference.

  We present the MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey, a four band MIRI survey with 25 pointing in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) extragalactic field. Three of the pointings utilized only the three reddest bands (F1000W, F1500W, F2100W) while the remainder of the pointings also add a blue filter (F770W). MEGA builds upon the existing observations in the EGS field by providing MIRI imaging for 68.9% of CEERS NIRCam imaging, filling a cruciality gap in order to understand galaxy evolution by observing the obscured Universe. Here, we present the technical design, data reduction, photometric catalog creation, the first data release, and science drivers of the MEGA survey. Our data reduction starts with the standard JWST calibration pipeline, but adds additional warm pixel masking and custom background subtraction steps to improve the quality of the final science image. We estimate the image depth of the reduced mosaics and present new galaxy number counts in four MIRI bands.

  NGC 5972, a Voorwerp galaxy, features a helical-shaped extended emission-line region (EELR) with a radius &gt; 10 kpc and a S-shaped radio structure spanning about 470 kpc. We use VLT MUSE, GMRT, and VLA to study the stellar and ionized gas kinematics and how the radio jet influences the gas in the galaxy. Our sensitive radio observations detect the southern jet for the first time, roughly coinciding with the southern EELR. The VLA images show a continuous inner jet connected to the outer E-W lobe, confirming the jet origin of the radio emission. Our kinematic analysis shows spatial correlations between the radio jet and the outflowing gas, supporting the jet-driven feedback mechanism. More interestingly, we observe enhanced velocity dispersion in the perpendicular direction along with a shell-like structure. Our BPT analysis shows that the [O III] emission overlapping with the radio jet is consistent with the shock+precursor model, whereas in the perpendicular region, a pure shock model fits well with the observations, indicating jet-induced shocks. Radio observations indicate episodic AGN activity characterized by surface brightness and spectral index discontinuities. Overall, based on our findings, we propose a jet-driven feedback mechanism as one of the key factors in the formation of the EELR in NGC 5972. Future high-resolution radio observations will be crucial to further investigate the origin of the EELR and quantify the extent to which the jet influences its formation and evolution.

  AT2023clx, which occurred in NGC3799 with a Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-Line Region (LINER), is one of the most nearby nuclear transients classified as a tidal disruption event (TDE). We present three-epoch spectropolarimetric follow-up observations of AT2023clx. We detected two polarization components; one is a constant polarization of $\sim 1\%$ originated from an aspherical outflow associated with the transient, while the other is a blue-excess polarization up to $\sim 2\%$ originated from a nuclear dusty environment via light echoes. Between the two epochs, the polarization angle flipped by 90 degrees, indicating that the direction of the outflow was aligned perpendicular to the dust plane. Such polarization features -- the blue excess and the 90-degree flip -- have never been observed in previous TDE polarization samples, highlighting unique mechanisms behind AT2023clx. We propose possible scenarios to naturally explain the polarization features: the disruption of a star captured by a nuclear dusty cloud around the black hole or a star formed within the cloud. Given the LINER nature of NGC3799, the dusty region may possibly be linked to a torus or disk associated with a weak Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Furthermore, as a more speculative scenario, the event might have been triggered by AGN-like activity, potentially linked to changing-look AGNs or ambiguous nuclear transients.
