  We investigate the velocity structure of nebular gas in the central galaxies of four clusters: Abell 1835, PKS 0745-191, Abell 262, and RXJ0820.9+0752, using data from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the [OII] emission line are compared to VSFs of molecular clouds observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Apart from Abell 262 where the gas is located in a circumnuclear disk, the nebular gas in the remaining galaxies lies in off-nuclear filamentary structures with VSFs steeper than the Kolmogorov slope. This steepening may be plausibly attributed to gravity although other factors, such as magnetic stresses and bulk motion,} may be significant. The VSFs of CO and [OII] emission are similar in RXJ0820 and Abell 262, indicating close coupling of the nebular and molecular gases. In contrast, the nebular and molecular gases are differentiated on most scales in PKS 0745 and Abell 1835. This discrepancy is likely due to the radio-AGN churning the gas. We compare the scale-dependent velocity amplitudes of the hot atmospheres constrained by X-ray surface brightness fluctuation analysis using Chandra observations to the nebular VSFs. The large-scale consistency in Abell 1835 and RXJ0820 is consistent with condensation from the hot atmospheres. {We explore substantial systematic biases, including projection effects, windowing, and smoothing effects when comparing VSFs using different telescopes and instruments.

  Stars in galactic centers are occasionally scattered so close to the central supermassive black hole that they are completely disrupted by tidal forces, initiating a transient accretion event. The aftermath of such a tidal disruption event (TDE) produces a bright-and-blue accretion flow which is known to persist for at least a decade (observationally) and can in principle produce ionizing radiation for hundreds of years. Tidal disruption events are known (observationally) to be overrepresented in galaxies which show extended emission line regions (EELRs), with no pre-TDE classical AGN activity, and to produce transient ``coronal lines'', such as [FeX] and [FeXIV]. Using coupled CLOUDY-TDE disk simulations we show that tidal disruption event disks produce a sufficient ionizing radiation flux over their lifetimes to power both EELR of radial extents of $r \sim 10^4$ light years, and coronal lines. EELRs are produced when the ionizing radiation interacts with low density $n_H \sim 10^1 - 10^3 \, {\rm cm}^{-3}$ clouds on galactic scales, while coronal lines are produced by high density $n_H \sim 10^6 - 10^8 \, {\rm cm}^{-3}$ clouds near the galactic center. High density gas in galactic centers will also result in the rapid switching on of narrow line features in post-TDE galaxies, and also various high-ionization lines which may be observed throughout the infrared with JWST. Galaxies with a higher intrinsic rate of tidal disruption events will be more likely to show macroscopic EELRs, which can be traced to originate from the previous tidal disruption event in that galaxy, which naturally explains why TDEs are more likely to be discovered in galaxies with EELRs. We further argue that a non-negligible fraction of so-called optically selected ``AGN'' are tidal disruption events.

  Characterizing the temporal variability of astrophysical sources is key to understanding the underlying physical processes driving their emissions. This work introduces a gammapy_SyLC, a Python package that offers tools to simulate and fit time-domain data, with a focus on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) variability. The package was developed taking into account possible interactions with gammapy but does not directly depend on it. gammapy_SyLC incorporates optimized implementations of the Timmer &amp; Koenig and Emmanoulopoulos algorithms for light curve simulation, capable of generating synthetic lightcurves from specified PSDs and amplitude distribution models. It also provides functionalities for PSD fitting, histogram-based PDF interpolation, and Monte Carlo-based parameter estimation, making it a full-stack tool for investigating variable phenomena and specifically the long-term behavior of AGNs. To showcase its capabilities, the package was applied to gamma-ray light curves from the Fermi Large Area Telescope repository, reconstructing PSDs and PDFs and constraining variability models for observed sources.

  The massive, hot galaxy cluster PSZ2 G286.98+32.90 (hereafter PLCKG287, z=0.383) hosts a giant radio halo and two prominent radio relics which are signs of a disturbed dynamical state. However, despite optical and radio observations indicate a clear multiple merger, the X-ray emission of the cluster, derived from XMM-Newton observations, shows only moderate disturbance. We present new 200 ks Chandra observations of PLCKG287. We detect a shock front to the NW direction at a distance of ~390 kpc from the X-ray peak, characterized by a Mach number M~1.3, as well as a cold front at a distance of ~300 kpc from the X-ray peak, nested in the same direction of the shock in a typical configuration expected by a merger. We also find evidence for X-ray depressions to the E and W, that could be the signature of feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The radial profile of the thermodynamic quantities show a temperature and abundance peak in the cluster center, where also the pressure and entropy have a rapid increase. Based on these properties, we argue that PLCKG287 is what remains of a cool core after a heating event. We estimate that both the shock energy and the AGN feedback energy, implied by the analysis of the X-ray cavities, are sufficient to heat the core to the observed temperature of ~17 keV in the central ~160 kpc. We discuss the possible origin of the detected shock by investigating alternative scenarios of merger and AGN outburst, finding that they are both energetically viable. However, no single model seems able to explain all the X-ray features detected in this system. This suggests that the combined action of merger and central AGN feedback is likely necessary to explain the reheated cool core, the large-scale shock and the cold front. The synergy of these two processes may act in shaping the distribution of cool core and non cool core clusters. [Abridged]
