  We compare the spatial clustering and physical properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFG) at fixed stellar mass using a volume limited sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The analysis of the two-point correlation function shows that the AGN are more strongly clustered than the SFG. The closer proximity to the $5^{th}$ nearest neighbour for the AGN than that for the SFG indicates that AGN prefer the denser regions. We compare the distributions of the $(u-r)$ colour, star formation rate (SFR), D$4000$ and concentration index of the AGN and SFG after matching their stellar mass distributions. The null hypothesis can be rejected at $&gt;99.99\%$ confidence level in each case. The comparisons are also carried out at different densities. The differences persist at the same significance level in both the high and low density regions, implying that such differences do not originate from the variations in the density. Alternatively stated, the AGN activity can be triggered in both the high and low density regions. An analysis of the correlations between the different physical properties at fixed stellar mass reveals that the anticorrelations of SFR with morphology, colour and recent star formation history are $2-3$ times stronger for the AGN than for the SFG. It suggests that the presence of a bulge and the availability of gas are the two most crucial requirements for AGN activity. We propose a picture where the galaxies at fixed stellar mass may have widely different assembly histories, leading to significant variations in bulge properties and cold gas content. Whether a galaxy of a given stellar mass can acquire the suitable conditions for AGN activity remains uncertain due to a broad diversity of assembly history. We conclude that AGN are stochastic phenomena owing to an underlying role of the assembly bias.

  Circumnuclear star forming regions (CNSFR) are massive clusters found close to galactic nuclei. These entities give us an excellent opportunity to study star formation in environments with high metallicity and to relate it with active galactic nuclei. Our principal aim is to derive the physical properties and dynamical masses of the CNSFRs in the two rings of the spiral NGC 7469, categorized as a Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) and hosting a Seyfert 1 nucleus. We have used archival data obtained with the MUSE spectrograph attached to one of the ESO VLT telescopes and we have applied the techniques shown in the first paper of the series. Regions in the studied galaxy show large sizes which can be explained by the stellar winds produced by WR stars. The inner ring regions seem to be more compact than the outer ones, showing higher electron densities and filling factors. The young stellar population of the clusters has contributions of ionising populations with ages around 5 Ma and its masses constitute less than a 1\% of the total mass of each cluster. The inner ring regions which are close to the active galactic nucleus probably are the only ones that have enough mass to survive the action of the AGN. They constitute the $\sim$ 90 \% of the total inner ring mass.

  Understanding the co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host systems requires a comprehensive census of active galactic nuclei (AGN) behavior across a wide range of redshift, luminosity, obscuration level and galaxy properties. We report significant progress with JWST towards this goal from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES). Based on comprehensive SED analysis of 3273 MIRI-detected sources, we identify 217 AGN candidates over a survey area of $\sim$34 arcmin$^2$, including a primary sample of 111 AGNs in normal massive galaxies ($M_{*}&gt;10^{9.5}~M_\odot$) at $z\sim$0--4, an extended sample of 86 AGN {\it candidates} in low-mass galaxies ($M_{*}&lt;10^{9.5}~M_\odot$) and a high-$z$ sample of 20 AGN {\it candidates} at $z\sim$4--8.4. Notably, about 80\% of our MIRI-selected AGN candidates are new discoveries despite the extensive pre-JWST AGN searches. Even among the massive galaxies where the previous AGN search is believed to be thorough, 34\% of the MIRI AGN identifications are new, highlighting the impact of obscuration on previous selections. By combining our results with the efforts at other wavelengths, we build the most complete AGN sample to date and examine the relative performance of different selection techniques. We find the obscured AGN fraction increases from $L_{\rm AGN, bol}\sim10^{10}~L_\odot$ to $10^{11}~L_\odot$ and then drops towards higher luminosity. Additionally, the obscured AGN fraction gradually increases from $z\sim0$ to $z\sim4$ with most high-$z$ AGNs obscured. We discuss how AGN obscuration, intrinsic SED variations, galaxy contamination, survey depth and selection techniques complicate the construction of a complete AGN sample.

  Stellar-mass black holes (sBH) embedded in gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be important sources of detectable gravitational radiation for LIGO/Virgo when they form binaries and coalesce due to orbital decay. In this paper, we study the effect of gas dynamical friction (DF) on the formation of BH binaries in AGN disks using $N$-body simulations. We employ two simplified models of DF, with the force on the BH depending on $\Delta {\bf v}$, the velocity of the sBH relative to the background Keplerian gas. We integrate the motion of two sBH initially on circular orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), and evaluate the probability of binary formation under various conditions. We find that both models of DF (with different dependence of the frictional coefficient on $|\Delta{\bf v}|$) can foster the formation of binaries when the effective friction timescale $\tau$ satisfies $\Omega_{\rm K}\tau\lesssim 20-30$ (where $\Omega_{\rm K}$ is the Keplerian frequency around the SMBH): prograde binaries are formed when the DF is stronger (smaller $\tau$), while retrograde binaries dominate when the DF is weaker (larger $\tau$). We determine the distribution of both prograde and retrograde binaries as a function of initial orbital separation and the DF strength. Using our models of DF, we show that for a given sBH number density in the AGN disk, the formation rate of sBH binaries increases with decreasing $\tau$ and can reach a moderate value with a sufficiently strong DF.
