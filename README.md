  Robust detections of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are essential to unravel the role of galaxy mergers in galaxy evolution and for identifying potential sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. One of the most commonly used observational signatures of SMBHBs is periodic variability in the light curves of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which may arise from accretion rate modulation or relativistic Doppler boosting due to binary orbital motion. However, intrinsic stochastic AGN variability can mimic such periodic signals, complicating robust identification. We report the discovery of 181 new SMBHB candidates from a sample of approximately 770,000 AGN observed by the Gaia space observatory. Periodic signals were identified using a novel and computationally efficient Bayesian model selection framework, enabling unbiased source selection and quantifying the likelihood of periodicity over stochastic variability. These candidates nearly double the known SMBHB population and provide a prioritized target list for next-generation time-domain surveys.

  AGNs exhibit a wide range of black hole masses and inflow/outflow properties. It is now possible to probe regions close to the event horizons of nearby SMBHs using VLBI with earth-sized baselines, as performed by the EHT. This study explores the emission properties of accretion and outflows near the event horizon of both low-mass and high-mass SMBHs. Using resistive GR-MHD simulations, we model AGNs with thin Keplerian disks. This contrasts with widely studied models featuring thick disks, such as magnetically arrested disks (MADs) or the standard and normal evolution (SANE) scenario. Our models serve as simplified representations to study disk-jet-wind structures. These simulations are postprocessed and ray-traced, using constraints of black hole mass and observed SEDs. Thermal synchrotron emission generated near the event horizon is used to create emission maps, which are analysed by separating accretion and outflow components to determine their contributions to the total intensity. Whether the emission appears optically thick or thin at a given frequency depends on its position relative to the synchrotron SED peak. At 230 GHz, low-mass SMBHs appear optically thicker than high-mass ones, even at lower accretion rates. Doppler beaming affects the brightness of emission from outflows with changing viewing angles in low-mass systems. Eddington ratios from our models align with those inferred by the EHTC for M87 and SgrA* using thicker MAD/SANE models. Although thin disks are optically thicker, their spectral properties make high-mass systems appear optically thinner at 230 GHz; ideal for probing GR effects like photon rings. In contrast, low-mass systems remain optically thicker at these frequencies because of synchrotron self-absorption, making outflow emissions near the horizon more pronounced. However, distinguishing these features remains challenging with current EHT resolution.

  Identifying AGNs in dwarf galaxies is critical for understanding black hole formation but remains challenging due to their low luminosities, low metallicities, and star formation-driven emission that can obscure AGN signatures. Machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly unsupervised methods, offer new ways to address these challenges by uncovering patterns in complex data. In this study, we apply Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to explore the SED manifold of dwarf galaxies and evaluate AGN selection biases across diagnostics. We train a 51 by 51 SOM on 30,344 dwarf galaxies (redshift less than 0.055 and stellar mass below 10 to the 9.5 solar masses) from the NSA catalog using nine-band photometry from near-UV to mid-infrared. A set of 438 previously identified dwarf AGNs, selected via various methods, was mapped onto the SOM. AGNs identified by different methods occupy distinct and partially overlapping regions in SED space, reflecting selection biases tied to host properties. BPT selected AGNs cluster in higher-mass regions, while X-ray and variability-selected AGNs show broader distributions. WISE-selected AGNs are concentrated in lower-mass regions and form two clumps: one associated with bluer, starburst-like systems and the other with redder, more AGN-like SEDs. This separation may help distinguish true AGN hosts from starburst contaminants in WISE-selected samples. AGNs selected via traditional emission-line, broad-line, and WISE methods tend to avoid SOM regions linked to strong star formation. In contrast, a subset of AGNs in low-mass galaxies occupy regions indicative of high AGN luminosity relative to stellar content, highlighting luminous AGNs in faint hosts. These results demonstrate the utility of manifold learning for improving AGN selection in the low-mass regime.

  Relativistic jets can be produced within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), leading to distinct thermal emission as they propagate through a dense disk environment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of dynamical evolution of jets embedded in an AGN disk and their associated observational properties, focusing on scenarios in which jets either successfully break out of the disk or become choked. By modeling the jet-cocoon system propagation, we calculate the thermal emission contributions from the jet-head shock breakout, disk cocoon, and jet cocoon components. Our results reveal that soft X-ray flares are the most prominent observable signatures, with duration ranging from O(10^2) s to O(10^5) s, occasionally exhibiting double-peaked light curves, whereas UV/optical flares are detectable only for powerful jets, persisting for several days to tens of days. This thermal emission serves as a critical electromagnetic counterpart to jet-producing events and provide insights into jet dynamics and AGN disk properties. Our findings highlight the importance of multi-wavelength follow-up observations to establish a diagnostic paradigm for candidate electromagnetic counterpart identification to AGN-embedded events and to distinguish thermal flares from AGN background variability.

  The detailed study of gas flows in local Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is essential for understanding the regulation of star formation and black hole growth, which are fundamental to galaxy evolution. One such AGN case study is NGC 5643, a nearby ($D_{L}\sim17.3$ Mpc) star-forming, late-type, Seyfert galaxy, where inflows and outflows have been observed in detail. NGC 5643 has been studied at multiple wavelengths, however, a key missing component is sensitive, high-resolution neutral hydrogen ($\mathrm{H\,I}$) observations. We present 21-cm observations of NGC 5643 with MeerKAT, revealing six low-$\mathrm{H\,I}$ mass ($M_{\text{$\mathrm{H\,I}$}}\sim10^{7} M_\odot$) sources surrounding NGC 5643 and $\mathrm{H\,I}$ in IC 4444, $\sim230$ kpc north of NGC 5643. In NGC 5643, $\mathrm{H\,I}$ extends beyond the stellar disk with several morphological and kinematical asymmetries. North of the disk is an extended 30 kpc tail with counter-rotating velocities. This is $\mathrm{H\,I}$ gas accreting onto the regularly rotating disk of NGC 5643 from the environment. Within the spiral arms of the disk, we identify extraplanar gas components, tracing galactic fountains driven by star formation regions. These fountains have a molecular gas component and show an increased $\mathrm{H}_2$/$\mathrm{H\,I}$ ratio. In the circum-nuclear region, we observe spatially unresolved $\mathrm{H\,I}$ absorption that is slightly blue-shifted ($\sim72$ \kms) with an $\mathrm{H\,I}$ emission counterpart at redshifted velocities. These MeerKAT observations provide a complete census of the $\mathrm{H\,I}$ in and around this nearby Seyfert galaxy, providing missing information on the cold gas flows fuelling the star formation and nuclear activity.
