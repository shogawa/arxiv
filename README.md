  Studies of star formation in various galaxy cluster mergers have reached apparently contradictory conclusions regarding whether mergers stimulate star formation, quench it, or have no effect. Because the mergers studied span a range of time since pericenter (TSP), it is possible that the apparent effect on star formation is a function of TSP. We use a sample of 12 bimodal mergers to assess the star formation as a function of TSP. We measure the equivalent width of the H-alpha emission line in ${\sim}100$ member galaxies in each merger, classify galaxies as emitters or non-emitters, and then classify emitters as star-forming galaxies (SFG) or active galactic nucleus (AGN) based on the [NII] $\lambda6583$ line. We quantify the distribution of SFG and AGN relative to non-emitters along the spatial axis defined by the subcluster separation. The SFG and AGN fractions vary from merger to merger, but show no trend with TSP. The spatial distribution of SFG is consistent with that of non-emitters in eight mergers, but show significant avoidance of the system center in the remaining four mergers, including the three with the lowest TSP. If there is a connection between star formation activity and TSP, probing it further will require more precise TSP estimates and more mergers with TSP in the range of 0-400 Myr.

  Radiative cooling and AGN heating are thought to form a feedback loop that regulates the evolution of low redshift cool-core galaxy clusters. Numerical simulations suggest that formation of multiphase gas in the cluster core imposes a floor on the ratio of cooling time ($t_{\rm cool}$) to free-fall time ($t_{\rm ff}$) at $\min ( t_{\rm cool} / t_{\rm ff} ) \approx 10$. Observations of galaxy clusters show evidence for such a floor, and usually the cluster cores with $\min ( t_{\rm cool} / t_{\rm ff} ) \lesssim 30$ contain abundant multiphase gas. However, there are important outliers. One of them is Abell 2029, a massive galaxy cluster ($M_{200} \gtrsim 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$) with $\min( t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}) \sim 20$, but little apparent multiphase gas. In this paper, we present high resolution 3D hydrodynamic AMR simulations of a cluster similar to A2029 and study how it evolves over a period of 1-2 Gyr. Those simulations suggest that Abell 2029 self-regulates without producing multiphase gas because the mass of its central black hole ($\sim 5\times 10^{10} \, M_\odot$) is great enough for Bondi accretion of hot ambient gas to produce enough feedback energy to compensate for radiative cooling.
