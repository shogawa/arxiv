  We study the X-ray reverberation in active galactic nuclei (AGN) using the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a machine-learning algorithm widely used for signal processing and feature reconstruction. While the X-ray reverberation signatures that contain the information of the accretion disk and the X-ray emitting corona are commonly analyzed in the Fourier domain, this work aims to extract the reverberation response functions directly from the AGN light curves. The VAE is trained using the simulated light curves that contain the primary X-rays from the lamp-post corona varying its height and the corresponding reflection X-rays from the disk. We use progressively more realistic light-curve models, such as those that include the effects of disk-propagating fluctuations and random noises, to assess the ability of the VAE to reconstruct the response profiles. Interestingly, the VAE can recognize the reverberation patterns on the light curves, hence the coronal height can be predicted. We then deploy the VAE model to the XMM-Newton data of IRAS 13224-3809 and directly estimate, for the first time, the response functions of this source in various observations. The result reveals the corona changing its height between $3~r_{\rm g}$ and $20~r_{\rm g}$, which is correlated with the source luminosity and in line with previous literature. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this method.

  We test a novel method for estimating black hole masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) in obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) that uses proxies to measure the full-width half maximum of broad H$\alpha$ (FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$) and the accretion disk luminosity at 5100 Angstrom ($\lambda L_{\rm 5100 Angstrom}$). Using a published correlation, we estimate FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$ from the narrow optical emission line ratio $L_{\rm [O\,III]}/L_{\rm nH\beta}$. Using a sample of 99 local obscured AGN from the Swift-BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey, we assess the agreement between estimating $\lambda L_{\rm 5100 Angstrom}$ from the intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and from narrow optical emission lines. We find a mean offset of $0.32 \pm 0.68$ dex between these methods, which propagates to a factor of $\sim$2 uncertainty when estimating $M_{\rm BH}$ using a virial mass formula where $L_{\rm [O\,III]}/L_{\rm nH\beta}$ serves as a proxy of FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$ ($M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$). We compare $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ with virial $M_{\rm BH}$ measurements from broad Paschen emission lines. For the 14 (12) BASS AGN with broad Pa$\alpha$ (Pa$\beta$) detections, we find $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ to be systematically higher than $M_{\rm BH,Pa\alpha}$ ($M_{\rm BH,Pa\beta}$) by a factor of 0.39 $\pm$ 0.44 dex (0.48 $\pm$ 0.51 dex). Since these offsets are within the scatter, more data are needed to assess whether $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ is biased high. For 151 BASS AGN with measured stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm *}$), we find that the $\sigma_{\rm *}$-derived $M_{\rm BH}$ agrees with $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ to within 0.08 dex, albeit with wide scatter (0.74 dex). The method tested here can provide estimates of $M_{\rm BH}$ in thousands of obscured AGN in spectroscopic surveys when other diagnostics are not available, though with an uncertainty of $\sim$3-5.

  Feedback from black hole-powered jets has been invoked in many cosmological simulations to regulate star formation and quench galaxies. Despite this, observational evidence of how jets might be able to affect their hosts remains scarce, especially for low power jets in halos smaller than clusters. Recent observations of outflows around FR0 galaxies, that host compact radio-loud sources, imply that lower-power jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) may have a significant impact on their hosts through jet interactions with the interstellar medium (ISM). Using the Arepo code, we launch jets of low and intermediate power (10$^{38}$ - 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) within a ~kpc-scale periodic box with driven turbulence to study how the jets propagate through a turbulent ISM. Our simulation results broadly fit into three different scenarios $\unicode{x2013}$ jets penetrating easily through the ISM, becoming completely stalled, or the interesting intermediate stage, when jets are highly disturbed and redirected. We suggest that intermediate power jets do not have enough ram pressure to affect the turbulent structure of the ISM, and so only fill pre-existing cavities. Low-power jets are able to drive outflows in a hot phase ($&gt;10^{4.4}$ K). However, warm (~$10^4$ K) ionized gas outflows appear under certain conditions. This work is part of the ''Learning the Universe'' collaboration, aiming to build next-generation cosmological simulations that incorporate a new prescription for AGN feedback.

  We search a sample of 9,361,613 isolated sources with 13&lt;g&lt;14.5 mag for slowly varying sources. We select sources with brightness changes larger than ~ 0.03 mag/year over 10 years, removing false positives due to, for example, nearby bright stars or high proper motions. After a thorough visual inspection, we find 782 slowly varying systems. Of these systems, 433 are identified as variables for the first time and 349 are previously classified as variables. Previously classified systems were mostly identified as semi-regular variables (SR), slow irregular variables (L), spotted stars (ROT), or unknown (MISC or VAR), as long time scale variability does not fit into a standard class. The stellar sources are scattered across the CMD and can be placed into 5 groups that exhibit distinct behaviors. The largest groups are very red subgiants and lower main sequence stars. There are also a small number of AGN. There are 551 candidates (~70 percent) that also show shorter time scale periodic variability, mostly with periods longer than 10 days. The variability of 191 of these candidates may be related to dust.

  We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22$\rm \mu$m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous ($\rm flux_{W4} &gt; 5mJy$, i.e., $12.62 &lt; W4 &lt; 14.62 \rm\ AB \, magnitude$), optically faint ($r &gt; 23$) or with red color ($r - W4 &gt;8.38$). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range $0.88 - 2.99$ (12 are at $z&gt;2$). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1$\rm \mu$m to 10$\rm \mu$m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of $L_{\rm torus} 10^{46.84} \rm erg/s$. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have $L_{\rm bol} = 10^{46.28} \rm erg \,s^{-1} - 10^{47.49} \rm erg \,s^{-1}$ and around SMBH masses $\rm 10^{8.18} M_{\odot} - 10^{9.39} M_{\odot}$, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at $z&gt;2$. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.
