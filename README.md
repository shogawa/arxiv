  Understanding how gas flows into galactic centres, fuels the AGN, and is in turn expelled back through feedback processes is of great importance to appreciate the role AGN play in the growth and evolution of galaxies. We use the MUSE-AO optical spectra of the inner 7".5x 7".5 of the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593 to characterise its ionised gas kinematics. We fit single-Gaussian components to the [O iii]$\lambda$ 5007 and [N ii]$\lambda$ 6583 emission lines, and double-Gaussian components to H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ to determine the main ionisation mechanism of the gas. To determine the kinematics of the ionised gas, we fit double-Gaussian components to the [O iii]$\lambda$ 5007 line. Based on the stellar kinematic maps, we confirm the presence of a rotating disc. For the ionised gas, we find high-velocity dispersion values of up to $\mathrm{200-250\,km\,s^{-1}}$ that show that part of the gas is highly perturbed. The dominant ionisation mechanism of the gas is AGN photoionisation, which reaches the highest values within the innermost 4arcsec (680pc) diameter of the galaxy. At larger radii, the emission line ratios correspond to values in the composite region of the BPT diagram. The broad-component of [O iii]$\lambda$ 5007 shows blue-shifted velocities on the east side of the central 2arcsec (340pc), which spatially coincide with a region of high velocity-dispersion. This confirms the presence of outflowing gas. We estimate a mass outflow rate and kinetic power of ${\dot{M}}\geq {0.048 \,M_\odot\,{{\rm yr}^{-1}} }$ and ${\dot{E}_{\text{kin}}} \geq 4.09 \times 10^{39} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$. The derived mass outflow rate is consistent with that expected from empirical relations between mass outflow rate and AGN luminosity for a low-luminosity AGN such as NGC 4593.

  The far-infrared (FIR) - radio correlation (FRC) is one of the most promising empirical constraints on the role of cosmic-rays (CRs) and magnetic fields (\textbf{B}) in galaxy formation and evolution. While many theories have been proposed in order to explain the emergence and maintenance of the FRC across a gamut of galaxy properties and redshift, the non-linear physics at play remain unexplored in full complexity and cosmological context. We present the first reproduction of the $z \sim 0$ FRC using detailed synthetic observations of state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE-3 suite with explicitly-evolved CR proton and electron (CRe) spectra, for three models for CR transport and multi-channel AGN feedback. In doing so, we generally verify the predictions of `calorimeter' theories at high FIR luminosities (\Lsixty\, $\gtrsim$ 10$^{9.5}$) and at low FIR luminosities (\Lsixty\, $\lesssim$ 10$^{9.5}$) the so-called `conspiracy' of increasing ultraviolet radiation escape in tandem with increasing CRe escape, and find that the global FRC is insensitive to \textit{orders-of-magnitude} locally-variable CR transport coefficients. Importantly, the indirect effect of AGN feedback on emergent observables highlights novel interpretations of outliers in the FRC. In particular, we find that in many cases, `radio-excess' objects can be better understood as \textit{IR-dim} objects with longer-lived radio contributions at low $z$ from Type Ia SNe and intermittent black hole accretion in quenching galaxies, though this is sensitive to the interplay of CR transport and AGN feedback physics. This creates characteristic evolutionary tracks leading to the $z=0$ FRC, which shape the subsequent late-time behavior of each model.

  The structure and chemistry of the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) are shaped by complex processes that depend on the local radiation field, gas composition, and dust grain properties. Of particular importance are Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), which emit strong vibrational bands in the mid-infrared, and play a key role in the ISM energy balance. We recently identified global correlations between PAH band and optical line ratios across three nearby galaxies, suggesting a connection between PAH heating and gas ionization throughout the ISM. In this work, we perform a census of the PAH heating -- gas ionization connection using $\sim$700,000 independent pixels that probe scales of 40--150 pc in nineteen nearby star-forming galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We find a universal relation between $\log$PAH(11.3 \mic/7.7 \mic) and $\log$([SII]/H$\alpha$) with a slope of $\sim$0.2 and a scatter of $\sim$0.025 dex. The only exception is a group of anomalous pixels that show unusually high (11.3 \mic/7.7 \mic) PAH ratios in regions with old stellar populations and high starlight-to-dust emission ratios. Their mid-infrared spectra resemble those of elliptical galaxies. AGN hosts show modestly steeper slopes, with a $\sim$10\% increase in PAH(11.3 \mic/7.7 \mic) in the diffuse gas on kpc scales. This universal relation implies an emerging simplicity in the complex ISM, with a sequence that is driven by a single varying property: the spectral shape of the interstellar radiation field. This suggests that other properties, such as gas-phase abundances, gas ionization parameter, and grain charge distribution, are relatively uniform in all but specific cases.

  The Perseus cluster is the brightest X-ray cluster in the sky and is known as a cool-core galaxy cluster. Being a very nearby cluster, it has been extensively studied. This has provided a comprehensive view of the physical processes that operate in the intracluster medium (ICM), including feedback from the AGN 3C84 and measurements of ICM turbulence. Additionally, the Perseus cluster contains a central radio mini-halo. This diffuse radio source traces cosmic ray electrons (re-)accelerated in-situ in the ICM.   Here we report on LOFAR high-band antenna 120-168 MHz observations of the Perseus cluster that probe a range of four orders of magnitude in angular scales. In our 0.3 arcsec resolution image, we find that the northern extension of the 3C84 lobe consists of several narrow 1.5-3 kpc parallel strands of emission. In addition, we detect steep-spectrum filaments associated with a previous outburst of the central AGN radio emission filling two known X-ray ghost cavities. At 7 arcsec resolution, our images show a complex structured radio mini-halo, with several edges and filaments. At resolutions of 26 arcsec and 80 arcsec, we discover diffuse radio emission with a 1.1 Mpc extent. We classify this emission as a giant radio halo and its properties are distinct from the inner mini-halo. We also detect two diffuse sources at projected cluster centric radii of 0.7 and 1.0 Mpc. Finally, we observe a 0.9 Mpc long trail of radio emission from the cluster member galaxy IC310, connecting it with the giant radio halo. Together with other recent studies of relaxed clusters, our LOFAR observations indicate that cluster-wide radio emission could be (more) common in cool-core clusters. In the case of the Perseus cluster, a past off-axis merger event that preserved the cool core might have generated enough turbulence to produce an extended radio halo observable at low frequencies.

  The local (z=0.0315) AGN Mrk 817, was monitored over more than 500 days with space-borne and ground-based instruments as part of a large international campaign AGN STORM 2. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the broad-band continuum variations using detailed modeling of the broad line region (BLR), several types of disk winds classified by their optical depth, and new numerical simulations. We find that diffuse continuum (DC) emission, with additional contributions from strong and broad emission lines, can explain the continuum lags observed in this source during high and low luminosity phases. Disk illumination by the variable X-ray corona contributes only a small fraction of the observed continuum lags. Our BLR models assume radiation pressure-confined clouds distributed over a distance of 2-122 light days. We present calculated mean-emissivity radii of many emission lines, and DC emission, and suggest a simple, transfer-function-dependent method that ties them to cross-correlation lag determinations. We do not find clear indications for large optical depth winds but identify the signature of lower column density winds. In particular, we associate the shortest observed continuum lags with a combination of tau(1 Ryd) approx. 2 wind and a partly shielded BLR. Even smaller optical depth winds may be associated with X-ray absorption features and with noticeable variations in the width and lags of several high ionization lines like HeII and CIV. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of torus dust emission on the observed lags in the i and z bands.

  Tidal disruption events (TDEs) could be an important growth channel for massive black holes in dwarf galaxies. Theoretical work suggests that the observed active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies are predominantly TDE-powered. To assess this claim, we perform variability analyses on the dwarf-hosted AGNs detected in the $7$ Ms Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) survey, with observations spanning $\approx 16$ years. Based on the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling with X-CIGALE, we select AGNs hosted by dwarf galaxies (stellar mass below $10^{10}\ M_\odot$). We focus on X-ray sources with full-band detections, leading to a sample of $78$ AGNs (0.122 $\leq$ $z$ $\leq$ 3.515). We fit the X-ray light curves with a canonical TDE model of $t^{-5/3}$ and a constant model. If the former outperforms the latter in fitting quality for a source, we consider the source as a potential TDE. We identify five potential TDEs, constituting a small fraction of our sample. Using true- and false-positive rates obtained from fitting models to simulated light curves, we perform Bayesian analysis to obtain the posterior of the TDE fraction for our sample. The posterior peaks close to zero ($2.56\%$), and we obtain a $2$-$\sigma$ upper limit of $9.80\%$. Therefore, our result indicates that the observed AGNs in dwarf galaxies are not predominantly powered by TDEs.

  Radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies have been detected in GeV gamma-rays by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), but the origin of much of this emission is unclear. We consider the nearby example, the Seyfert galaxy GRS 1734-292, which exhibits weak starburst and jet activities that are insufficient to explain the observed gamma-ray flux. With the first detailed multi-wavelength study of this source, we demonstrate that an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk wind can account for its gamma-ray emission. Using a lepto-hadronic emission model based on a shocked ambient medium and a shocked wind region created by an AGN accretion disk wind, we identify two viable scenarios that are consistent with the Fermi-LAT data and multi-wavelength observations: a hadronic pp-dominated scenario and a leptonic external Compton-dominated scenario. Both of these show that future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) could detect TeV emission from a disk wind in GRS 1734-292. Such a detection would substantially improve our understanding of cosmic ray acceleration efficiency in AGN disk wind systems, and would establish radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies as cosmic ray accelerators capable of reaching ultra-high energies.

  We present the formation histories of 19 massive ($\gtrsim3\times10^{10}\text{M}_\odot$) quiescent galaxy candidates at $z\sim3.0-4.5$ observed using JWST/NIRSpec. This completes the spectroscopic confirmation of the 24 $K$-selected quiescent galaxy sample from the ZFOURGE and 3DHST surveys \citep{Schreiber2018}. Utilizing Prism $1-5\mu$m spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at $z&gt;3$, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of $\sim1.4\times10^{-5}\text{Mpc}^{-3}$ between $z\sim3-4$. Rest-frame $U-V$ vs $V-J$ color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of $\sim90\%$. Our analysis shows that parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed $\sim6\times10^{10}\text{M}_\odot$ by $z\sim10$ and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at $z\sim3.2$. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, wavelength range, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. The assumed SFH prior, however, influences the star formation rate at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated $z\sim3$ quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.

  Dwarf galaxies hold the key to crucial frontiers of astrophysics, however, their faintness renders spectroscopy challenging. Here we present the JWST Cycle 2 survey, All the Little Things (ALT, PID 3516), which is designed to seek late-forming Pop III stars and the drivers of reionization at $z\sim6-7$. ALT has acquired the deepest NIRCam grism spectroscopy yet (7-27 hr), at JWST's most sensitive wavelengths (3-4 $\mu$m), covering the powerful lensing cluster Abell 2744. Over the same 30 arcmin$^2$, ALT's ultra-deep F070W+F090W imaging ($\sim$30 mag) enables selection of very faint sources at $z&gt;6$. We demonstrate the success of ALT's novel ``butterfly" mosaic to solve spectral confusion and contamination, and introduce the ``Allegro" method for emission line identification. By collecting spectra for every source in the field of view, ALT has measured precise ($R\sim1600$) redshifts for 1630 sources at $z=0.2-8.5$. This includes one of the largest samples of distant dwarf galaxies: [1015, 475, 50] sources less massive than the SMC, Fornax, and Sculptor with $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;$[8.5, 7.5, 6.5]. We showcase ALT's discovery space with: (i) spatially resolved spectra of lensed clumps in galaxies as faint as $M_{\rm{UV}}\sim-15$; (ii) large-scale clustering -- overdensities at $z$=[2.50, 2.58, 3.97, 4.30, 5.66, 5.77, 6.33] hosting massive galaxies with striking Balmer breaks; (iii) small-scale clustering -- a system of satellites around a Milky Way analog at $z\sim6$; (iv) spectroscopically confirmed multiple images that help constrain the lensing model underlying all science in this legacy field; (v) sensitive star-formation maps based on dust-insensitive tracers such as Pa$\alpha$; (vi) direct spectroscopic discovery of rare sources such as AGN with ionized outflows. These results provide a powerful proof of concept for how grism surveys maximize the potential of strong lensing fields.   

Relativistic Reflection Modeling in AGN and Related Variability from

  X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveal relativistic reflections from the innermost regions of accretion disks, which contain general-relativistic footprints caused by spinning supermassive black holes (SMBH). We anticipate the spin of a SMBH to be stable over the human timeframe, so brightness changes in the high-energy corona above the SMBH should slightly alter relativistic reflection. In this brief review, we discuss the latest developments in modeling relativistic reflection, as well as the rapid small variation in relativistic emission disclosed by the principal component analysis (PCA) of X-ray variability in AGN. PCA studies of X-ray spectra from AGNs have shown that relativistically blurred reflection has negligible fluctuations over the course of observations, which could originate from rapid (intrahour) intrinsic variations in near-horizon accretion flows and photon rings. The PCA technique is an effective way to disclose relativistic reflection from X-ray observations of AGNs, simplifying the complexity of largely variable X-ray data for automated spectral analysis with machine learning algorithms.
