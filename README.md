  Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxy mergers with separations $&lt;$ 1kpc are crucial to our understanding of SMBH growth, galaxy evolution, and the evolution of SMBH binaries. Despite their importance, there are less than a handful known, and most have been discovered serendipitously. In this work, we employ a new selection method to systematically pre-select candidate advanced mergers likely to contain unresolved substructure at sub-arcsecond scales. By exploiting the large survey area and astrometric precision of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we have identified a sample of 48 nearby advanced mergers that have red WISE colors ($W_1-W_2&gt;0.5$) indicative of accretion activity and significant sub-arcsecond offsets between their optical and infrared coordinates as measured by SDSS and WISE. We conducted high resolution adaptive optics (AO) observations of this sample with the Keck NIRC2 camera in the $K_p$ band ($2.124 ~ \mu m$, $\Delta\lambda = 0.351 \mu m$) to search for evidence of previously unresolved substructure suggested by the optical-to-infared offsets. We find that a significant fraction (20/48 or 42%) of the sample shows substructure tracing the SDSS/WISE offset and unresolved by SDSS, demonstrating that our methodology is a promising pathway to find dual AGN in follow-up spectroscopy. Archival optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging reveals that substructure identified with Keck is often missed in the optical or erroneously identified due to partial obscuration, underscoring the importance of carrying out studies of late-stage mergers in the infrared.

  We report unnoticed but intriguing features in the peculiar nuclear transient AT 2022fpx, and investigate its type. These features include the constantly red optical color of $g-r&gt;0$, stable soft X-ray flare ($kT\sim100$ eV) in the past $\sim$550 days, prominent mid-infrared echo peaked at $\sim$$10^{43.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the confirmation of a weak AGN by weak flares in pre-event WISE mid-infrared light curves with no contemporary optical, radio or X-ray counterparts. The combination of the optical red color and possible TDE origin of AT 2022fpx is particularly attractive, as it challenges the most widely accepted and adopted "blue color" criterion for optical TDE selection. Although we still cannot confirm whether the red color is intrinsic, we however find that the "blue color" criterion can filter out normal TDEs whose optical-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are either severely contaminated by prominent emission lines (especially H$\alpha$) or heavily dust-reddened. Hence, its potential selection effect may have been imprinted on the whole optical TDE family. Blackbody fitting on the optical (rest-frame $\sim$$4000-7000$ {\AA}) and optical-UV ($\sim$$2000-7000$ {\AA}) SEDs of four TDEs with high-cadence UV observations shows that $T_\mathrm{bb}$ rise by $\sim$40$-$110 % when the UV bands are included. The power-law models ($f_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha=2-3$) can fit the rest-frame $\sim$$2000-7000$ {\AA} SEDs more consistently, indicating that SEDs should peak at shorter wavelengths, but not simple blackbodies. Hence, the estimated released energy for the optical-UV bright but X-ray faint TDEs based on blackbody SED fitting should be significantly lower than the intrinsic energy.

  The corona is an integral component of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) which can produce the X-ray emission. However, many of its physical properties and the mechanisms powering this emission remain a mystery. In this work, we study the coronal X-ray variabilities of 13 AGNs by Gaussian Process. 2-10 keV light curves of 13 AGNs can be successfully described by the damped-random walk (DRW) model. The extracted coronal X-ray timescales range from 3 to 50 days. In the plot of variability timescale versus black hole mass, the coronal X-ray timescales of four sources occupy almost the same region as the optical timescales of the accretion disk, with the latter matching the predicted thermal instability timescale of the disk. In contrast, the X-ray timescales of the remaining sources exhibit a systematic offset toward lower values. We propose that the coronal X-ray variability may be driven by internal processes within the corona itself (such as thermal conduction). On the other hand, it may also be triggered by local thermal instabilities occurring in different regions (close to the central black hole) of the accretion disk, which propagate to the corona via disk-corona coupling.

  The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a next-generation Stage-IV sky survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image quality, and multi-band observation capabilities. It can simultaneously conduct precise measurements of the Universe by performing multi-color photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys. The CSST is equipped with five scientific instruments, i.e. Multi-band Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy Survey Camera (SC), Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C), and THz Spectrometer (TS). Using these instruments, the CSST is expected to make significant contributions and discoveries across various astronomical fields, including cosmology, galaxy and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, stars, exoplanets, Solar System objects, astrometry, and transients and variable sources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CSST instruments, observational capabilities, data products, and scientific potential.

  Interband lags in the optical continua of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been observed over years of monitoring, yet their physical origins remain unclear. While variable interband lags have been found in a few individual AGN potentially, the temporal behavior of interband lags of an AGN sample has not been explored systematically. Here, we analyze the interband lags of 94 bright AGN at $z&lt;0.8$, using both seasonal one-year and full six-year $gri$-band light curves from Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 22. We find that more than half of 94 AGN show significant seasonal variations in the interband lags. Besides, the short-term lags, derived by averaging lags inferred from multiple seasonal light curves, are consistently smaller than the long-term lags, which are inferred from the full six-year light curves. This supports recent theoretical simulations where the lag measurement is sensitive to the baseline of light curve and the lag variation could be simply attributed to the inherent randomness of AGN variability. Our findings suggest that the interband lags of AGN are more complex and stochastic than commonly thought, and highlight the importance of high-precision time-domain surveys in uncovering the properties of AGN variability as well as the associated accretion physics.

  The powerful jets of blazars have been historically considered as likely sites of high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. However, particulars of the launched jet and the locations of leptonic and hadronic jet loading remain unclear. In the case when leptonic and hadronic particle injection occur jointly, a temporal correlation between synchrotron radiation and neutrino production is expected. We use a first catalog of millimeter (mm) wavelength blazar light curves from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope for a time-dependent correlation with twelve years of muon neutrino events from the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory. Such mm emission is known to trace activity of the bright jet base, which is often self-absorbed at lower frequencies and potentially gamma-ray opaque. We perform an analysis of the population, as well as analyses of individual, selected sources. We do not observe a significant signal from the stacked population. TXS 0506+056 is found as the most significant, individual source, though this detection is not globally significant in our analysis of selected AGN. Our results suggest that the majority of mm-bright blazars are neutrino dim. In general, it is possible that many blazars have lighter, leptonic jets, or that only selected blazars provide exceptional conditions for neutrino production.

  We present a systematic search for spatial association between a high-confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers detected through SDSS imaging and the 4FGL-DR4 catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using a conservative 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson-based statistical framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match probabilities $p &lt; 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters such as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger-driven processes can fuel high-energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of AGN-like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy mergers, opening new avenues for understanding the role of interactions in high-energy astrophysics. We additionally examined the sample of 70 galaxy pairs from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and found no statistically significant matches, with $p &lt; 0.05$ within the 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold.   

The physical mechanism of radio-quiet turn-on changing-look active

  It is suggested that the variation of mass accretion rate in accretion disk may be responsible for the occurrence of most changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL AGNs). However, the viscous timescale of a thin disk is far longer than the observed timescale of CL AGNs. Though this problem can be resolved by introducing the large-scale magnetic field, the mechanism for radio-quiet CL AGNs with weak/absent large-scale magnetic field remains a mystery. In this work, we assume that the thin accretion disk is collapsed from the inner advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) instead of substituting by the outer thin disk through advection. This idea is tested by comparing the cooling timescale ($t_{\rm cool}$) of an ADAF with the observed timescale ($t_{\rm tran}$) of turn-on CL AGNs. We compile a sample of 102 turn-on CL AGNs from the archived data and calculate the cooling timescale of an ADAF with the critical mass accretion rate based on some conventional assumptions. It is found that $t_{\rm cool}$ is much shorter than $t_{\rm tran}$ in most of the CL AGNs, which validates our assumption though $t_{\rm cool}$ is not consistent with $t_{\rm tran}$ ($t_{\rm cool}&lt;t_{\rm tran}$). However, this is reasonable since most of the CL AGNs were observed only two times, indicating that the observed timescale $t_{\rm tran}$ is the maximum value because the changing-look can indeed happen before the second observation.

  Giant radio sources, including galaxies and quasars (hereafter GRGs), are active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting relativistic jets with source sizes exceeding the projected length of 0.7 Mpc. They are crucial to understanding the evolution of radio sources and their interaction with the surrounding environment. Some of these enigmatic objects, e.g., NGC 315, have also been reported as gamma-ray emitters. Since GRGs are thought to be aligned close to the plane of the sky, they are invaluable targets to explore the radiative mechanisms responsible for the observed gamma-ray emission. We have carried out a systematic search of gamma-ray emitting GRGs using sensitive low-resolution radio surveys, such as by Low Frequency Array, NRAO VLA Sky Survey, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, and considering the fourth data release of the fourth Fermi-Large Area Telescope gamma-ray source (4FGL-DR4) catalog. By carefully inspecting the radio maps of all AGN included in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, we have identified 16 gamma-ray emitting GRGs, including 8 of them being reported as GRGs for the first time. Some of their observed parameters, e.g., core dominance, appeared to differ from that found for the non-gamma-ray detected GRG population, possibly due to the relatively small viewing angle of the gamma-ray emitting jet. The observed gamma-ray properties of these objects were found to be similar to non-GRG gamma-ray emitting misaligned AGN. We conclude that the origin of the gamma-ray emission could be similar in both source populations.   

Exploring the X-ray--radio connection for AGN via measurements of the
  multi-dimensional luminosity function

  We present new methods to quantify the AGN population in terms of a multi-dimensional luminosity function that describes the space density of sources as a function of both X-ray and radio luminosity. We compile a sample of 1891 radio and X-ray detected extragalactic sources from the Bo\"otes and COSMOS fields. First, we investigate the X-ray--radio luminosity correlation in the sample and find that an apparent correlation is introduced due to the sensitivity limits of the surveys; when considering individual redshift bins we find a wide range of radio luminosities associated with a given X-ray luminosity, and vice versa, indicating little direct connection between the emission processes. We then measure the X-ray luminosity function, radio luminosity function and multi-dimensional X-ray--radio luminosity function across redshift ($0&lt;z&lt;6$). We apply luminosity thresholds in X-ray and radio to restrict our sample to those in the AGN-dominated regime and explore how the fraction of radio-selected AGN within the overall X-ray sample varies with increasing X-ray luminosity (and vice versa). We find that towards the highest X-ray and radio luminosities the fraction of sources with both an X-ray and radio detection increases towards 100%, indicating that at the highest luminosities we are more likely to obtain a detection in both bands, though the source will not necessarily be bright in both bands. Thus, the most luminous accretion events are more likely to be associated with the production of a jet, despite the distinct physical structures that produce the emission and likely persist over very different timescales.

  Protoclusters of galaxies are overdense regions of the Universe characterized by large gas reservoirs. Such environments make them perfect laboratories to investigate galaxy-AGN co-evolution and the growth of SMBHs. Galaxies living in such a dense regions are expected to growth efficiently their SMBH, resulting in a higher incidence of AGN than in the field. Some protoclusters exhibit extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae in their central region, pinpointing the presence of massive gas reservoirs, but whose main powering mechanism is still debated. We aim to investigate the AGN population, and AGN enhancement, in three protoclusters at 2.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 which host enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe). Additionally, we search for the presence of X-ray diffuse emission in the same region of the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae to reveal multi-phase gas in these protoclusters. We use deep (190-270 ks) Chandra observations to identify AGN among the protocluster members and perform X-ray spectral analysis to derive the properties of those sources. We compare the AGN fraction and space density with those observed in other known protoclusters and from the field environment. We find 11 X-ray detected AGN in the three protoclusters. Each structure hosts a central, X-ray powerful (log$(L_{\rm X}/{\rm erg \, s^{-1}}) \sim 45-46$), QSO, while the other X-ray sources are mostly moderately luminous (log$(L_{\rm X}/{\rm erg \, s^{-1}}) \sim 44$) and obscured Compton-Thin AGN. The fraction of AGN in our targets is comparable with estimates for other protoclusters, and significantly higher than what is found for low-redshift clusters. We also find a significant enhancement (2-4 dex) of AGN density with respect to the field and to non active galaxies in the protoclusters. Finally, we find no significant soft X-ray diffuse emissions from the nebulae, thus ruling out gravitational heating as the main powering mechanism of the ELANe.   

On the ages of the stellar populations of galaxies at $z=0.1$-7

  Recent studies have reported a non evolution of galaxy ages at redshifts higher than $z\sim$ 2.5, as well as galaxies older than the Universe. In this work, a sample of galaxies from JWST and HST was analysed via photometry to further understand this astronomical phenomenon. No prior cosmological parameters were assumed in the analysis, but the spectroscopic redshift. When compared to stellar population synthesis models, the results for mass-weighted galaxy ages indicate that the analysed objects seem to be divided into two subsets. The results for the subset with the majority of objects (60\% assuming a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology) indicate an evolution of galaxy ages within the redshift range $z$=0.1-7.0, in the sense that higher redshift galaxies are younger than the Universe. Sources of systematic errors were discussed drawing into conclusion that degeneracies between reddening-age-metallicity, and/or AGN emission may explain the rest 40\% of the galaxies with ages older than expected from a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

  Disc winds play a crucial role in many accreting astrophysical systems across all scales. In accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN), radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising wind-driving mechanism. However, the efficiency of line driving is extremely sensitive to the ionization state of the flow, making it difficult to construct a reliable physical picture of these winds. Recently, we presented the first radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations for AWDs that incorporated detailed, multi-dimensional ionization calculations via fully frequency-dependent radiative transfer, using the Sirocco code coupled to PLUTO. These simulations produced much weaker line-driven winds (Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc &lt; 1e-5 for our adopted parameters) than earlier studies using more approximate treatments of ionization and radiative transfer (which yielded Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc ~ 1e-4). One remaining limitation of our work was the assumption of an isothermal outflow. Here, we relax this by adopting an ideal gas equation of state and explicitly solving for the multi-dimensional temperature structure of the flow. In the AWD setting, accounting for the thermal state of the wind does not change the overall conclusions drawn from the isothermal approximation. Our new simulations confirm the line-driving efficiency problem: the predicted outflows are too highly ionized, meaning they neither create optimal driving conditions nor reproduce the observed ultraviolet wind signatures. Possible solutions include wind clumping on sub-grid scales, a softer-than-expected spectral energy distribution, or additional driving mechanisms. With the physics now built into our simulations, we are well-equipped to also explore line-driven disc winds in AGN.
