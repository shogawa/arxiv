  The Dragonfly Galaxy (MRC 0152-209), the most infrared-luminous radio galaxy at redshift z~2, is a merger system containing a powerful radio source and large displacements of gas. We present kpc-resolution data from ALMA and the VLA of carbon monoxide (6-5), dust, and synchrotron continuum, combined with Keck integral-field spectroscopy. We find that the Dragonfly consists of two galaxies with rotating disks that are in the early phase of merging. The radio jet originates from the northern galaxy and brightens when it hits the disk of the southern galaxy. The Dragonfly Galaxy therefore likely appears as a powerful radio galaxy because its flux is boosted into the regime of high-z radio galaxies by the jet-disk interaction. We also find a molecular outflow of (1100 $\pm$ 550) M$_{\odot}$/yr associated with the radio host galaxy, but not with the radio hot-spot or southern galaxy, which is the galaxy that hosts the bulk of the star formation. Gravitational effects of the merger drive a slower and longer lived mass displacement at a rate of (170 $\pm$ 40) M$_{\odot}$/yr, but this tidal debris contain at least as much molecular gas mass as the much faster outflow, namely M(H2) = (3 $\pm$ 1) x 10$^9$ (alpha(CO)/0.8) M$_{\odot}$. This suggests that both the AGN-driven outflow and mass transfer due to tidal effects are important in the evolution of the Dragonfly system. The Keck data show Ly$\alpha$ emission spread across 100 kpc, and CIV and HeII emission across 35 kpc, confirming the presence of a metal-rich and extended circumgalactic medium previously detected in CO(1-0).

  We use the Cosmic Archaeology Tool (CAT) semi-analytical model to explore the contribution of Population (Pop) III/II stars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) evolution at $4 \leq z \leq 20$. We compare in particular with recent JWST data in order to explore the apparent tension between observations and theoretical models in the number density of bright galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$. The model predicts a star formation history dominated by UV faint ($M_{\rm UV} &gt; - 18$) galaxies, with a Pop III contribution of $\lesssim 10\%$ ($\lesssim 0.5\%$) at $z \simeq 20$ ($z \simeq 10$). Stars are the primary sources of cosmic reionization, with $5 - 10 \%$ of ionizing photons escaping into the intergalatic medium at $5 \leq z \leq 10$, while the contribution of unobscured AGNs becomes dominant only at $z \lesssim 5$. The predicted stellar and AGN UV LFs reproduce the observational data at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 9 - 10$. At higher redshift, CAT predicts a steeper evolution in the faint-end slope ($M_{\rm UV} &gt; - 18$), and a number density of bright galaxies ($M_{\rm UV} \simeq -20$) consistent with data at $z \sim 10 - 11$, but smaller by 0.8 dex at $z \sim 12 - 13$, and 1.2 dex at $z \sim 14 - 16$, when compared to the values estimated by recent studies. Including the AGN emission does not affect the above findings, as AGNs contribute at most to $\lesssim 10 \%$ of the total UV luminosity at $M_{\rm UV} &lt; - 19$ and $z \gtrsim 10$. Interestingly, considering a gradual transition in the stellar IMF, modulated by metallicity and redshift as suggested by recent simulations, the model agrees with JWST data at $z \sim 12 - 13$, and the disagreement at $z \sim 14 - 16$ is reduced to 0.5 dex.
