We investigate the environmental parameters and gas fraction (f$_{gas}$) properties of type~2 AGN and non-AGN galaxies, utilizing a large sample of galaxies from SDSS DR7 with z $\le$ 0.3. We find that the environment affects type~2 AGN and non-AGN galaxies in similar ways and does not impact the strength of AGN-driven outflows. The f$_{gas}$ of type~2 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies show no variation between group and isolated environments, suggesting that host galaxy gas content is largely independent of large-scale environment. We find that type~2 AGN host galaxies possess systematically lower f$_{gas}$ than their non-AGN counterparts when matched in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). This suggests that AGN activity plays a significant role in regulating the molecular gas reservoir and, consequently, the star formation processes within galaxies. We find that Type~2 AGNs exhibiting strong outflows are associated with higher gas fractions, higher star-formation rates, and younger stellar populations than those with weak or no outflows. This may indicate either concurrent star formation in gas-rich systems hosting powerful outflows, or a time delay between AGN activity and its effect on star formation consistent with a delayed AGN feedback scenario.

Between the groundbreaking detections of stellar-mass black holes by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and JWST's revelation of a surprisingly abundant population of supermassive black holes, one crucial missing link remains: the elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). IMBHs represent a key phase in the hierarchical growth of black holes, yet they have persistently evaded detection. Traditional methods, effective for both actively accreting and quiescent black holes, have largely failed to uncover this hidden population. Here, we argue that novel observational strategies--particularly time-domain variability studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and tidal disruption events--provide a promising path forward. Finding IMBHs will resolve critical gaps in our understanding of black hole formation and the various mechanisms driving their subsequent growth. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, with its unprecedented capacity to monitor the dynamic sky, stands to revolutionize our ability to detect these long-sought IMBHs, shedding new light on the assembly history of black holes across cosmic time.

In this Letter, we report the detection of soft X-ray time lags-i.e. variability in the softer photons lagging behind that in the harder photons-in seven XMM-Newton observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT2021ehb. We find correlated variability between the soft (0.3-0.7 keV) and hard (0.9-10 keV) bands on about 10^4 s time-scales, and measure a soft lag of about 500 s. This behaviour is broadly consistent with the disk-corona reverberation scenario established in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Together with the previously reported strong hard X-ray emission and broad Fe K line, our results suggest the presence of a compact corona and prominent relativistic disk reflection in AT2021ehb. The unusually high blackbody temperature (peaking at about 200 eV) is difficult to reconcile with thermal emission from a standard accretion disk around a about 10^7 Msun black hole, and may instead be analogous to the soft excess commonly observed in AGNs, whose physical origin remains debated. Finally, the measured lags offer a possible explanation for the rapid X-ray flux decline that occurred only three days after the peak, pointing to a scenario in which the corona cools following a sudden loss of the magnetic support required to sustain it.
