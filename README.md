  In this paper we explore the properties of the z=6.853 obscured hyperluminous quasar COS-87259, discovered in the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, with our recently developed Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code SMART (Spectral energy distributions Markov chain Analysis with Radiative Transfer models). SMART fits SEDs exclusively with multicomponent radiative transfer models that constitute four different types of pre-computed libraries for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, the starburst and the spheroidal or disc host. We explore two smooth radiative transfer models for the AGN torus and two two-phase models, in order to put constraints on the AGN fraction of the galaxy, the black hole mass and its star formation rate (SFR). We find that either of the smooth tapered disc or the two-phase flared disc models provide a good fit to the SED of COS-87259. The best-fitting models predict an AGN fraction in the range 86-92 per cent, a bolometric AGN luminosity of 5.8-10.3 x 10^13 Lo, a black hole mass of 1.8-3.2 x 10^9 Mo (assuming the quasar is accreting at the Eddington limit) and an SFR in the range 1985-2001 Mo/yr. The predicted space density of such objects in the redshift range 4-7 is about 20 times more than that of co-eval unobscured quasars.

  We present the analysis of three intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies (QGs) with stellar masses of $\sim10^{10}M_{\rm \odot}$ at redshifts $z\sim 3 - 4$ using NIRSpec low-resolution spectroscopy. Utilising the SED fitting code BAGPIPES, we confirm these target galaxies are consistent with quiescent population, with their specific star formation rates (sSFR) falling below 2-dex the star-forming main sequence at the same redshifts. Additionally, we identify these QGs to be less massive than those discovered in previous works, particularly prior to the JWST era. Two of our target galaxies exhibit the potentially-blended H${\alpha}$+[NII] emission line within their spectra with $S/N&gt;5$. We discuss whether this feature comes from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) or star formation although future high-resolution spectroscopy is required to reach a conclusion. One of the target galaxies is covered by JWST/NIRCam imaging of the PRIMER survey. Using the 2D profile fitting code Galfit, we examine its morphology, revealing a disc-like profile with a S\'{e}rsic index of $n=1.1 \pm 0.1$. On the size-mass relation, we find a potential distinction between less-massive ($\log_{10}{(M_*/M_\odot)}&lt;10.3$) and massive ($\log_{10}{(M_*/M_\odot)}&gt;10.3$) QGs in their evolutionary pathways. The derived quenching timescales for our targets are less than 1 Gyr. This may result from these galaxies being quenched by AGN feedback, supporting the AGN scenario of the emission line features.

  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered many faint AGNs at high-$z$ by detecting their broad Balmer lines. However, their high number density, lack of X-ray emission, and overly high black hole masses with respect to their host stellar masses suggest that they are a distinct population from general type-1 quasars. Here, we present clustering analysis of 28 low-luminosity broad-line AGNs found by JWST (JWST AGNs) at $5&lt;z&lt;6$ based on cross-correlation analysis with 679 photometrically-selected galaxies to characterize their host dark matter halo (DMH) masses. From angular and projected cross-correlation functions, we find that their typical DMH mass is $\log (M_\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 11.61_{-0.24}^{+0.19},$ and $ 11.72_{-0.20}^{+0.17}$, respectively. This result implies that the host DMHs of these AGNs are $\sim1$ dex smaller than that of luminous quasars. The DMHs of JWST AGNs at $5&lt;z&lt;6$ are predicted to grow to $10^{12\unicode{x2013}13}\,h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$, a typical mass of quasar at $z\lesssim3$. Applying the empirical stellar-to-halo mass ratio to the measured DMH mass, their host stellar mass is evaluated as $\log(M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot)=9.72_{-0.39}^{+0.31},$ and $ 9.90_{-0.33}^{+0.27}$, which are higher than some of those estimated by the SED fitting. We also evaluate their duty cycle as $f_\mathrm{duty}=0.36_{-0.14}^{+0.18}$ per cent, namely $\sim7\times10^6$ yr as the lifetime of JWST AGNs. While we cannot exclude the possibility that JWST AGNs are simply low-mass type-1 quasars, these results suggest that JWST AGNs are a different population from type-1 quasars, and may be the ancestors of quasars at $z\lesssim3$.

  This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LF) of star-forming (SF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) using data from the ZFOURGE survey. We employ CIGALE to decompose the spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies into SF and AGN components to investigate the co-evolution of these processes at higher redshifts and fainter luminosities. Our CIGALE-derived SF and AGN LFs are generally consistent with previous studies, with an enhancement at the faint end of the AGN LFs. We attribute this to CIGALE's capability to recover low-luminosity AGN more accurately, which may be underrepresented in other works. As anticipated, the CIGALE SF LFs are best fit with a Schechter function, whereas the AGN LFs align more closely with a Saunders function. We find evidence for a significant evolutionary epoch for AGN activity at $z \approx 1$, comparable to the peak of cosmic star formation at $z \approx 2$, which we also recover well. Based on our results, the gas supply in the early universe favoured the formation of brighter star-forming galaxies until $z=2$, below which the gas for SF becomes increasingly exhausted. Conversely, AGN activity peaked earlier and declined more slowly until $z \approx 1$, suggesting a possible feedback scenario in which $2.5-3$ Gyrs offset the evolution of SF and AGN activity.

  The Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) is a spectroscopic redshift survey of the Southern hemisphere completed in 2006. While it provides 136,304 spectra of mostly low-redshift galaxies, a large and reliable catalogue of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) that are selected based on spectral signatures is still lacking. In this work, we present an extensive list of verified broad emission-line AGN in the 6dFGS sample. We visually confirm the AGN nature of all spectra, and disentangle fibre cross-talk to remove bogus AGN. The final catalogue contains 2,515 unique broad-line AGN with a median redshift of 0.207, of which 891 are identified for the first time. A flux-limited subsample contains 665 AGN to a K-band magnitude of 13. This new sample adds to the list of known low-luminosity AGN in the Southern hemisphere and thus provides a basis for investigations of low-redshift AGN with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
