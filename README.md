  We apply a stacking technique to gain enough statistics to detect the hot CGM around galaxies. We use the X-ray data from the first four SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS:4). We discuss how the satellite galaxies could bias the stacking and carefully build the central galaxy samples based on the SDSS spectroscopic survey and halo-based group finder algorithm and isolated galaxy sample from the ninth data release of the DESI Legacy survey (LS DR9, photometric). We mask the detected X-ray point sources and carefully model the X-ray emission from the unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries (XRB) to obtain the X-ray emission from the hot CGM. The X-ray surface brightness profiles are measured for $\log(M_*)&gt;10.0$ or $\log(M_{\rm 200m})&gt;11.5$ central galaxies, and $\log(M_*)&gt;9.5$ isolated galaxies. We detect the X-ray emission around MW-mass ($\log(M_*)=10.5-11.0$) and more massive central galaxies extending up to the virial radius ($R_{\rm vir}$). The signal-to-noise ratio of the extended emission around the MW-mass galaxy is about $8.1\sigma$ within $R_{\rm vir}$. We use the $\beta$ model to describe the X-ray surface brightness profiles of the hot CGM. We obtain a central surface brightness of $S_{\rm X,0}\approx 3.1\times10^{35}\rm erg/s/kpc^2$ and $\beta \approx0.42$ for MW-mass galaxy. We estimate the baryon budget of the hot CGM and obtain a value lower than the $\Lambda CDM$ cosmology predicted. Our results set a firm footing for the presence of a hot CGM around MW-mass and more massive central galaxies. These measurements constitute a new benchmark for galaxy evolution models and possible implementations of feedback processes therein.

  The eROSITA instrument aboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) satellite has performed its first all-sky survey between December 2019 and June 2020. This paper presents the resulting hard X-ray (2.3-5 keV) sample, the first created from an all-sky imaging survey in the 2-8 keV band, for sources within western galactic sky. The 5466 hard X-ray selected sources detected with eROSITA are presented and discussed. The Bayesian statistics-based code NWAY is used to identify the counterparts for the X-ray sources. These sources are classified based on their multiwavelength properties, and the literature is searched to identify spectroscopic redshifts, which further inform the source classification. A total of 2547 sources are found to have good-quality counterparts, and 111 of these are detected only in the hard band. Comparing with other hard X-ray selected surveys, the eROSITA hard sample covers a larger redshift range and probes dimmer sources, providing a complementary and expanded sample as compared to Swift-BAT. Examining the column density distribution of missed and detected eROSITA sources present in the follow-up catalog of Swift BAT 70 month sources, it is demonstrated that eROSITA can detect obscured sources with column densities $&gt;10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, but that the completeness drops rapidly after $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. A sample of hard-only sources, many of which are likely to be heavily obscured AGN, is also presented and discussed. X-ray spectral fitting reveals that these sources have extremely faint soft X-ray emission and their optical images suggest that they are found in more edge-on galaxies with lower b/a. The resulting X-ray catalog is demonstrated to be a powerful tool for understanding AGN, in particular heavily obscured AGN found in the hard-only sample.

  During its calibration and performance verification phase, the eROSITA instrument aboard the SRG satellite performed a uniform wide--area X-ray survey of approximately 140 deg$^{2}$ in a region of the sky known as the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS). The primary aim of eFEDS is to demonstrate the scientific performance to be expected at the end of the 8-pass eROSITA all sky survey. This will provide the first focussed image of the whole sky in the hard X-ray ($&gt;2$~keV) bandpass. The expected source population in this energy range is thus of great interest, particularly for AGN studies. We use the 2.3--5 keV selection presented by Brunner et al. (2022) to construct a sample of 246 point-like hard X-ray sources for further study and characterization. These are classified as either extragalactic ($\sim 90$~\%) or Galactic ($\sim 10$~\%), with the former consisting overwhelmingly of AGN and the latter active stars. We concentrate our further analysis on the extragalactic/AGN sample, describing their X-ray and multiwavelength properties and comparing them to the eFEDS main AGN sample selected in the softer 0.2-2.3 keV band. The eROSITA hard band selects a subsample of sources that is a factor $&gt;10$ brighter than the eFEDS main sample. The AGN within the hard population reach up to $z=3.2$ but on the whole are relatively nearby, with median $z$=0.34 compared to $z$=0.94 for the main sample. The hard survey probes typical luminosities in the range $\log L_{\rm X} = 43-46$. X-ray spectral analysis shows significant intrinsic absorption (with $\log N_{\rm H}&gt;21$) in $\sim 20$~\% of the sources, with a hard X-ray power law continuum with mean $&lt;\Gamma&gt;=1.83\pm0.04$, typical of AGN, but slightly harder than the soft-selected eROSITA sample.

  Evolutionary models suggest that the initial growth phases of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are dust-enshrouded, and characterized by jet/wind outflows that should gradually clear the interstellar medium (ISM) in the host by heating and/or expelling the surrounding gas. eFEDSJ091157.4+014327 (z~0.6) was selected from X-ray samples for its characteristics that are similar to sources with outflows which include red, obscured (2.7x10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ ) and X-ray luminous (6.5x10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). We aim to explore the environment around the red quasar and characterise kinematics within the system. We use spatially resolved spectroscopic data from Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) with an average seeing of 0.6" to construct flux, velocity and velocity dispersions maps. We found that the quasar is embedded in an interacting and merging system with three other galaxies ~ 50 kpc from its nucleus. Spatially resolved kinematics reveal that the quasar has extended ionised outflows of up to 9.4 kpc with positive and negative velocities up to 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and -1200 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The velocity dispersion (W$_{80}$) ranges from 600-1800 km s$^{-1}$. We associate the presence of turbulent and high-velocity components with the outflow. The total mass outflow rate is estimated to be 9.6 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic power of 1.9x10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Considering different recipes of velocity and AGN bolometric luminosities, the kinetic coupling efficiencies range from 0.01%-0.2% and the momentum boosts from 0.04-0.5. The kinetic coupling efficiency values are low which indicates that the outflow is not very significant from the energetic point of view but is slightly consistent with theoretical predictions of radiation-pressure-driven outflows. The mass loading factor of 4.8 is an indication that these outflows are more likely AGN-driven than star formation-driven.

  We present an extensive radio monitoring campaign of the nuclear transient eRASSt J234403-352640 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, one of the most X-ray luminous TDE candidates discovered by the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. The observations reveal a radio flare lasting more than 1000 d, coincident with the X-ray, UV, optical, and infra-red flare of this transient event. Through modelling of the 10 epochs of radio spectral observations obtained, we find that the radio emission is well-described by an expanding synchrotron emitting region, consisting of a single ejection of material launched coincident with the optical flare. We conclude that the radio flare properties of eRASSt J234403-352640 are consistent with the population of radio-emitting outflows launched by non-relativistic tidal disruption events, and that the flare is likely due to an outflow launched by a tidal disruption event (but could also be a due to a new AGN accretion event) in a previously turned-off AGN.

  The extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission with its first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) has offered an unprecedented, comprehensive view of the variable X-ray sky. With enhanced sensitivity, broader energy coverage, and improved resolution compared to prior surveys, the eRASS1 Data Release 1 (DR1) catalogue underwent a variability analysis, focusing on a substantial subset of 128,669 sources. We performed multiple variability tests, utilizing conventional normalized excess variance, maximum amplitude variability, and Bayesian excess variance methods. Among the 128,669 DR1 sources, our research identified 557 objects exhibiting variability through NEV and AMPLMAX tests. After applying suitable thresholds, 108 sources demonstrated significant variability via NEV, while 73 did so through AMPLMAX. The utilization of the bexvar method extended our detection capabilities to lower count rates, unveiling a total of 1307 sources manifesting variability. Furthermore, our comparative analysis spanning 2.5 years encompassed observations from consecutive eROSITA surveys, eRASS2, eRASS3, eRASS4, and eRASS5. Notably, the Gamma-ray burst afterglow GRB 200120A, which was the most variable DR1 source, was as expected absent in subsequent eROSITA survey scans. Observations of the Low-Mass X-ray Binary GX 339-4 across various eROSITA survey scans unveiled substantial variability. These outbursts involve the movement of the inner radius of the accretion disk, fluctuating inward and outward. Combining eROSITA and MAXI data reveals that the most effective tracer for monitoring the onset of the outbursts is the softest eROSITA band. Magnetically active stars are commonly found among the more variable X-ray sources. We analyzed the AGN sample to identify variability patterns and instances of efficiency limit violations.

  Aims: During its all-sky survey phase, the eROSITA X-ray telescope onboard SRG scans through the ecliptic poles every 4 hours. This extensive data set of long-duration, frequent, and consistent observations of thousands of X-ray sources is ideal for a detailed long-term X-ray variability analysis. However, individual observations are short, are separated by long but consistent gaps, and have varying exposure times. Therefore, the identification of variable sources, and the characterisation and quantification of their variability requires a unique methodology. We aim to develop and evaluate such methods for eROSITA observations, focusing on sources close to the survey poles.   Methods: We simulate eROSITA-like light curves to evaluate and quantify the effect of survey mode observations on the measured periodogram and normalised excess variance. We introduce a new method for estimating the normalised intrinsic variance of a source based on the Bayesian excess variance (bexvar) method.   Results: We determine thresholds for identifying likely variable sources while minimising the false-positive rate, as a function of the number of bins, and the average count rate in the light curve. The bexvar normalised intrinsic variance estimate is significantly more accurate than the normalised excess variance method in the Poisson regime. At high count rates, the two methods are comparable. We quantify the scatter in the intrinsic variance of a stationary pink noise process, and investigate how to reduce it. Finally, we determine a description of the excess noise in a periodogram caused by varying exposure times throughout a light curve. Although most of these methods were developed specifically for analysing variable AGN in the eROSITA all-sky survey, they can also be used for the variability analysis of other datasets from other telescopes, with slight modifications.

  Major mergers between galaxies are predicted to fuel their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), particularly after coalescence. However, determining the prevalence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in mergers remains a challenge, because AGN diagnostics are sensitive to details of the central structure (e.g., nuclear gas clouds, geometry and orientation of a dusty torus) that are partly decoupled from SMBH accretion. X-rays, expected to be ubiquitous among accreting systems, are detectable through non-Compton-thick screens of obscuring material, and thus offer the potential for a more complete assessment of AGNs in mergers. But, extant statistical X-ray studies of AGNs in mergers have been limited by either sparse, heterogeneous, or shallow on-sky coverage. We use new X-ray observations from the first SRG/eROSITA all-sky data release to characterize the incidence, luminosity, and observability of AGNs in mergers. Combining machine learning and visual classification, we identify 923 post-mergers in Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) imaging and select 4,565 interacting galaxy pairs (with separations &lt;120 kpc and mass ratios within 1:10) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that galaxies with X-ray AGNs are 2.0+/-0.24 times as likely to be identified as post-mergers compared to non-AGN controls, and that post-mergers are 1.8+/-0.1 times as likely to host an X-ray AGN as non-interacting controls. A multi-wavelength census of X-ray, optical, and mid-IR-selected AGNs suggests a picture wherein the underlying AGN fraction increases during pair-phase interactions, that galaxy pairs within ~20 kpc become heavily obscured, and that the obscuration often clears post-coalescence.

  We investigate the impact of AGN feedback, on the entropy and characteristic temperature measurements of galaxy groups detected in the SRG/eROSITA's first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) to shed light on the characteristics of the feedback mechanisms. We analyze deeper eROSITA observations of 1178 galaxy groups detected in eRASS1. We divide the sample into 271 subsamples and extract average thermodynamic properties, including electron density, temperature, and entropy at three characteristic radii along with the integrated temperature by jointly analyzing X-ray images and spectra following a Bayesian approach. We present the tightest constraints on the impact of AGN feedback through our average entropy and characteristic temperature measurements of the largest group sample used in X-ray studies, incorporating major systematics in our analysis. We find that entropy shows an increasing trend with temperature in the form of a power-law-like relation at the higher intra-group medium temperatures, while for the low mass groups, a slight flattening is observed on the average entropy. Overall, the observed entropy measurements agree well with the earlier measurements in the literature. The comparisons with the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (MillenniumTNG, Magneticum, OWL simulations) after the applications of the selection function calibrated for our galaxy groups reveal that observed entropy profiles in the cores are below the predictions of simulations. At the mid-region, the entropy measurements agree well with the Magneticum simulations, whereas the predictions of MillenniumTNG and OWL simulations fall below observations. At the outskirts, the overall agreement between the observations and simulations improves, with Magneticum simulations reproducing the observations the best. Our measurements will pave the way for more realistic AGN feedback implementations in simulations.

  As the brightest galaxy cluster in the X-ray sky, Perseus is an excellent target for studying the Intracluster Medium (ICM), but until recently, its active galactic nucleus (AGN) made studies of the diffuse emission near its center nearly impossible to accomplish with NuSTAR due to the extended wings of NuSTAR's PSF. The development of a new open source software package -- nucrossarf -- now allows the contribution from point and diffuse sources to be modeled so that scattered light from the AGN can be accounted for. Using this technique, we present an analysis of diffuse hard X-ray (3-25keV) emission from the ICM using three archival NuSTAR observations of the Perseus cluster. We find a ~10% excess of emission beyond 20keV not describable by purely thermal models. By performing similar analyses of AGN in archival observations, we have characterized the systematic uncertainty of the modeled AGN contribution to be 3.4%. However, in order to explain the excess, the total scattered AGN emission would have to be 39% stronger than we have measured. We test physical explanations for the excess, such as diffuse inverse Compton emission potentially originating from the radio mini-halo, but we determine that none of the models are compelling. An upper limit on inverse Compton flux ($\leq1.5\times10^{-11}$erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$) and a corresponding lower limit on global magnetic field strength ($\geq 0.35~\mu G$) is derived. We discuss the potential origin and implications of the excess and present our characterization of the nucrossarf systematic uncertainty, which should be useful for future work.

  We present mock JWST observations for more than 215,000 different galaxies from the Astrid simulation with $3 \leq z \leq 6$. The mock observations are made using the BPASS stellar SED model, and a simple dust model. They are then viewed through NIRCam filters, convolved with a PSF, have noise added, and are drizzled together to emulate the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We analyse this dataset by computing a number of morphological measures and find our catalog to have comparable statistics to similar mock catalogs, and the first release of CEERS data. We find that most of the Sersic indices of galaxies in our redshift range are lower than observed, with most having n less than one. Additionally, we observe the sizes of galaxies of all masses to increase from redshift z=6 to redshift z=3 consistent with other results. The number of galaxies in our catalog allows us to examine how relationships like the mass-size relation evolve with redshift, and compare the accuracy of a variety of traditional galaxy classification techniques (Sersic fit, Asymmetry-Concentration, and Gini-$M_{20}$) within our redshift range. We find the mass-size relation to be nearly flat at redshift z=6, and consistently increases as redshift decreases, and find the galaxy classification methods have minimal correlation with each other in our redshift range. We also investigate the impact that different stages of our imaging pipeline have on these morphological measures to determine how robust mock catalogs are to different choices at each step. Finally, we test the addition of incorporating light from AGNs into our pipeline and find that while the population of galaxies that have significant AGN luminosity is low, those galaxies do tend to have higher Sersic indices once the AGN luminosity is added, rectifying some of the systematic bias towards lower Sersic indices present in our dataset.

  Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are thought to represent the first step in the evolutionary path of radio galaxies. In this work, we investigate the X-ray emission of two CSOs confirmed to emit at GeV energies: PKS 1718-649 and TXS 1146+596. Unveiling the origin of their observed high-energy emission is crucial to establishing the physical parameters of the radio source and understanding how CSOs interact with the surrounding medium. We combined archival and new NuSTAR observations of PKS 1718-649 and TXS 1146+596 to have a broadband X-ray coverage. For both sources, we model the broadband spectral energy distribution, from radio band up to $\gamma$-rays, to derive their physical parameters. We also discuss the role of the ambient medium in confining the source expansion, which we investigate using X-ray obscuration. For the first time, we report on X-ray detections of PKS 1718-649 and 1146+596 with NuSTAR at energies higher than 10 keV. Combining Chandra and NuSTAR observations of TXS 1146+596, we reveal the presence of a multi-temperature thermal component dominating the soft X-ray spectrum, and we interpret this finding as indicative of an AGN feedback process in action in this source. In addition, we show that two emitting electrons populations are necessary to reproduce the observed broadband spectral energy distribution of TXS 1146+596: in our models, the X-ray emission could be produced either by synchrotron radiation or by a weak X-ray corona or an ADAF-type emission. Interestingly, an additional X-ray component, i.e. a weak corona, is also required for PKS 1718-649. Moreover, we argue that heavily obscured, and possibly frustrated, sources tend to show different radio sizes with respect to unobscured, free to expand, ones.
