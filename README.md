  Stellar black holes (sBHs) are widely believed to exist in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Previous studies often focus on the transient emission produced by embedded sBHs. Here, we explore the possible observational consequences of an AGN accretion disk that contains a population of accreting sBHs. Embedded accreting sBHs change the effective temperature distribution of the AGN accretion disk by heating gas in the outer regions. Two possible observational consequences are presented. First, the spectral energy distribution has a turnover feature at $\sim 4700\ \textrm{\AA}$ when the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass is $\sim 10^8\ M_{\odot}$, which can help explain the observed shallow spectral shape at wavelengths $&gt;5000\ \textrm{\AA}$ for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar composite spectrum. Second, the half-light radius of a given relatively long wavelength is significantly larger than for an AGN disk without sBHs, which can be tested by microlensing observations. With appropriate sBH distributions, the model can be reconciled with quasar microlensing disk sizes. We propose that the half-light radius-wavelength relation can be utilized to investigate the distributions of embedded sBHs in AGN accretion disks.

  We report first-time reverberation mapping results for 14 AGNs from the ongoing Monitoring AGNs with H$\beta$ Asymmetry campaign (MAHA). These results utilize optical spectra obtained with the Long Slit Spectrograph on the Wyoming Infrared 2.3m Telescope between 2017 November-2023 May. MAHA combines long-duration monitoring with high cadence. We report results from multiple observing seasons for 9 of the 14 objects. These results include H$\beta$ time lags, supermassive black hole masses, and velocity-resolved time lags. The velocity-resolved lags allow us to investigate the kinematics of the broad-line region.

  Using several variants of the cosmological Simba simulations, we investigate the impact of different feedback prescriptions on the cosmic star formation history. Adopting a global-to-local approach, we link signatures seen in global observables, such as the star formation rate density (SFRD) and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), to feedback effects in individual galaxies. We find a consistent picture: stellar feedback mainly suppresses star formation below halo masses of $M_{\rm H} = 10^{12} \rm \, M_{\odot}$ and before $z = 2$, whereas AGN feedback quenches the more massive systems after $z = 2$. Among Simba's AGN feedback modes, AGN jets are the dominant quenching mechanism and set the shape of the SFRD and the GSMF at late times. AGN-powered winds only suppress the star formation rate in intermediate-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm \star} = 10^{9.5 - 10} \rm \, M_{\odot}$), without affecting the overall stellar mass-assembly significantly. At late times, the AGN X-ray feedback mode mainly quenches residual star formation in massive galaxies. Our analysis reveals that this mode is also necessary to produce the first fully quenched galaxies before $z=2$, where the jets alone are inefficient. These initially highly star-forming galaxies contain relatively large black holes, likely strengthening the X-ray-powered heating and ejection of gas from the dense, central region of galaxies. Such extra heating source quenches the local star formation and produces a more variable accretion rate. More generally, this effect also causes the break down of correlations between the specific star formation rate, the accretion rate and the black hole mass.

  In this paper we investigate the stellar populations and star formation histories of 235 active galactic nuclei (AGN)-host dwarf galaxies, consisting of four samples identified separately with different methods (i.e., radio, X-ray, mid-IR and variability), utilizing the synthesis code STARLIGHT and spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8. Our results show that the variability sample is the oldest, while the mid-IR sample is the youngest, for which the luminosity at 4020 \AA\ is dominated ($&gt;50\%$) by the young population ($t&lt;10^8$ yr). The light-weighted mean stellar age of the whole sample is in general about 0.7 dex younger than the optical sample studied in Cai et al. We compare the population results between fitting models with and without a power-law (PL) component and find that the neglect of a PL component would lead to an under- and over-estimation by 0.2 and 0.1 dex for the light- and mass-weighted mean stellar age, respectively, for our sample of dwarf galaxies, which has a mean fractional contribution of $\sim$16\% from the AGN. In addition, we obtain further evidence for a possible suppression of star formation in the host galaxy by the central AGN. We also find that there exists an anti-correlation between the extinction-corrected [O\,{\sc iii}] luminosity and light-weighted mean stellar age, confirming our previous finding that there is a physical connection between AGN and star-forming activities in AGN-host dwarfs.
