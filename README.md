  We present a statistical analysis of Ly$\alpha$ absorption using 581 galaxies at $z=4.5$-13 observed with multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs, including JADES, UNCOVER, CEERS, and GO/DDT. We carefully construct composite spectra binned by redshift with homogeneous UV properties (UV magnitudes, UV slopes, and Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths) and identify significant Ly$\alpha$ forest signals in galaxies at $z\sim5$-6, which diminish toward higher redshifts. We also find UV continuum breaks at rest-frame 1216\AA\ that soften beyond $z\gtrsim6$, confirming the effects of cosmic reionization through a self-consistent transition from Gunn-Peterson to Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption in galaxies. Fair comparisons of composite spectra with matched UV magnitudes and slopes across redshift reveal that UV-faint galaxies clearly show stronger Ly$\alpha$ absorption than UV-bright galaxies towards high redshift, providing insights into the topological evolution of reionization. We estimate Ly$\alpha$ transmission at the Gunn-Peterson trough and Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption by comparing the galaxy spectra to low-$z$ ($z\sim2$-5) galaxy templates that include galactic and circumgalactic absorption and Ly$\alpha$ emission. Using these measurements together with reionization simulations, we derive volume average neutral hydrogen fractions of $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle$ = ${0.00}^{+0.12}_{-0.00}$, ${0.25}^{+0.10}_{-0.20}$, ${0.65}^{+0.27}_{-0.35}$, ${1.00}^{+0.00}_{-0.20}$, and ${1.00}^{+0.00}_{-0.40}$ at $z\sim5$, 6, 7, 9, and 10, respectively. These values align with a reionization history characterized by a rapid transition around $z\sim7$-8, consistent with Ly$\alpha$ emitter observations. While the physical driver of this rapid reionization remains unclear, it may involve the emergence of hidden AGN populations and/or the onset of Lyman-continuum escape from galaxies.

  Over the past century, supernova (SN) searches have detected multiple supernovae (SNe) in hundreds of individual galaxies. So-called SN siblings discovered in the same galaxy present an opportunity to constrain the dependence of the properties of SNe on those of their host galaxies. To investigate whether there is a connection between sibling SNe in galaxies that have hosted multiple SNe and the properties of galaxies, we have acquired integrated optical spectroscopy of 59 galaxies with multiple core-collapse SNe. Perhaps surprisingly, a strong majority of host-galaxy spectra fall within the composite region of the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. We find a statistically significant difference (KS test p-value = 0.044) between the distributions of the [NII] $\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ of galaxies that have hosted a majority SN Ibc and those that have hosted a majority SN II, where the majority SN Ibc galaxies have, on average, higher ratios. The difference between the distributions of [NII] $\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ may arise from either increased contribution from AGN or LINERs in SN Ibc host galaxies, greater metallicity for SN Ibc host galaxies, or both. When comparing the inferred oxygen abundance and the ionization parameter for the galaxies in the Star-Forming region on the BPT diagram, we find statistically significant differences between the distributions for SN Ibc hosts and SN II hosts (p=0.008 and p=0.001, respectively), as well as SN Ib hosts and SN II hosts (p=0.030 and p=0.006, respectively). We also compare the H$\alpha$ equivalent width distributions, also integrated across the galaxies, and find no significant difference.

  3D Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) resistive simulations have highlighted the significance of ubiquitous turbulence to drive fast reconnection. It has been demonstrated that particle acceleration via reconnection in 3D magnetized flows, where turbulence is embedded in large-scale magnetic fields such as in relativistic jets and accretion flows around compact sources, is remarkably efficient. Particles experience Fermi acceleration across all scales of turbulent reconnection layers, outweighing the considerably slower drift acceleration mechanism. This stands in contrast to recent assertions stemming from PIC simulations, that claimed the dominance of the latter process. In this talk, I review how particle acceleration is driven by 3D turbulent reconnection to very high energies and demonstrate its potential in magnetized regions of AGN jets and accretion disks to explain the gamma-ray and neutrino emissions. Applications to sources such as TXS 0506+056, MRK 501, and NGC 1068 are discussed.

  Recent eROSITA measurements of the radial profiles of the hot CGM in the Milky-Way stellar mass (MW-mass) regime provide us with a new benchmark to constrain the hot gas around MW-mass central and satellite galaxies and their halo mass distributions. Modelling this rich data set with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations is required to further our understanding of the shortcomings in the current paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution models. We develop forward models for the stacked X-ray radial surface brightness profile measured by eROSITA around MW-mass galaxies. Our model contains two emitting components: hot gas (around central galaxies and satellite galaxies hosted by more massive halos) and X-ray point sources (X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei). We model the hot gas profile using the TNG300-based products. We generate mock observations with our TNG300-based model (matching stellar mass and redshift with observations) with different underlying halo mass distributions. We show that for the same mean stellar mass, a factor 2x increase in the mean value of the underlying halo mass distribution results in a ~4x increase in the stacked X-ray luminosity from the hot CGM. The point sources are described by a simple point-spread-function (PSF) of eROSITA, and we fit their normalization in this work. Using empirical models to derive a permissible range of AGN and XRB luminosities in the MW-mass X-ray galaxy stack, we choose our forward model best describing the hot CGM for the eROSITA observations. We find that at &lt; 40 kpc from the galaxy centre, the hot CGM from central galaxies and the X-ray point sources emission each account for 40-50% of the total X-ray emission budget. In summary, we show that the gas physics driving the shape of the observed hot CGM (in stellar-mass-selected samples) is tightly correlated by the underlying halo-mass distribution (abridged).

  The depth and coverage of the first years of JWST observations have revealed low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) across a wide redshift range, shedding light on black hole (BH) assembly and feedback. We present our spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGN obtained from JADES survey data and spanning $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 9$. Our sample of AGN probes a BH mass range of $10^{6-9}$~M$_{\odot}$ at bolometric luminosities down to $10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, implying generally sub-Eddington ratios of $&lt;0.5L_{\rm Edd}$. Most of these AGN are hosted in low mass ($M_{\star}\sim10^8$~M$_{\odot}$) galaxies and are overmassive relative to the local $M_{BH}-M_{\star}$ relation, while remaining consistent with the local $M_{BH}$-$\sigma_*$ relation. The wide redshift range provided by our sample allows us to trace the emergence of local $M_{BH}$-$M_*$ scaling relation across the cosmic epoch. Additionally, we explore the capability of narrow-line diagnostics in identifying Type 2 AGN and find that a significant fraction of our AGN would be missed by them due to low metallicity or lack of high energy ionizing photons (potentially due to dust absorption, dense gas blanketing the broad and narrow line regions, or intrinsically soft ionizing spectra). We explore the UV luminosity function of AGN and their hosts and find that it is subject to significant cosmic variance and is also dependent on the AGN bolometric luminosity. Finally, we show that the electron and Balmer scattering scenarios recently proposed to explain the broad components of the Balmer lines are untenable on multiple grounds. There is no evidence that the black hole masses have been overestimated by orders of magnitude as proposed in those scenarios.

  The diffuse stellar component of galaxy clusters known as intracluster light (ICL) has been proposed as an observable tracer of the cluster's dark matter (DM) halo. Assessing its reliability as a DM tracer requires understanding how the intracluster stars are energetically linked to the underlying DM distribution, which we investigate at $z\approx0$ in 12 galaxy clusters with $M_{178} = 1.18 - 3.71 \times 10^{14}\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ from the Horizon-AGN simulation. We quantify the orbital energies of these components by their mean specific energies ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$, and find that this quantity is $\approx$ 25 per cent lower for the intracluster stars than the DM, whilst the energetics of the satellite galaxies (a standard DM tracer) are only marginally ($\approx$ 5 per cent) higher than the DM. Importantly, the lower ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$ of the intracluster stars compared to the DM is robust against the precise separation between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL. The specific energy distribution of ICL stars is concentrated towards lower energies and poorly samples the higher energies, where much of the DM resides. Consequently, the intracluster stars have velocity distributions with lower typical speeds and a more centrally-concentrated density profile than the DM. We also find that intracluster stars have more radially-biased orbits than the DM, indicating these components have distinct orbital distributions. This study demonstrates that although the morphology of the ICL may match the DM halo, the ICL is a biased tracer of DM, and these biases must be understood in order to infer properties of the DM from the ICL.

  X-ray observations are essential for understanding the multimessenger emission mechanisms of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Blazars, a subset of AGN whose X-ray emission predominantly originates from relativistic jets, have been proposed as promising high-energy neutrino sources. In this work, we study the candidate neutrino-emitting blazar 5BZB J0630-24064, which has been observed over multiple epochs with the XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Neil Gehrels Swift-XRT, and eROSITA observatories. Analysis of the X-ray spectra in the 2.0-10.0 keV band shows significant variability, with high flux states adhering to a power-law model indicative of jet emission. However, during low-flux states, the spectrum reveals an additional component at hard-X-rays, indicating a transition from jet-dominated to multi-component X-ray emission, possibly associated with hadronic processes. To investigate this spectral evolution, we tested various models and found it to be consistent with corona emission or photoionised absorption processes typically observed in obscured AGN. The identification of the X-ray spectral variability in 5BZB J0630-24064, combined with its potential for neutrino production, opens new perspectives in multimessenger astrophysics of blazars highlighting the synergies between the mechanisms of the jet and the nuclear environment.

  There is compelling evidence that AGNs are strongly influenced by their environment. Therefore, studying the AGN population of clusters is essential, as both large-scale structures and AGN play key roles in galaxy evolution, though the interactions between these elements are still not well understood. The primary objective of this study is to unravel the different factors that may significantly affect the triggering of AGN activity in cluster galaxies, including galaxy merging and interactions with other galaxies, and ram pressure from the hot intracluster medium. For our purposes, we used 82 X-ray detected AGN found within a $4r_{500}$ radius of 164 X-ray detected and spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters of the XXL survey, up to a redshift of $z\sim$1. This field is covered by deep optical observations of the Hyper Suprime-Cam, which allows for a reliable morphological classification of galaxies. Furthermore, using the X-ray hardness ratio, the optical spectra and the SEDs of the X-ray sources, we have studied the obscuration and other AGN properties and the SFR of the hosts as further indicators of interactions. We found a moderately significant higher fraction of X-ray AGN in galaxy clusters hosted by merging or disturbed galaxies, compared to non-active cluster galaxies or X-ray AGN in the field. This excess is primarily localised in the cluster outskirts. Also, we discovered a higher number of X-ray-hard AGN (hence, possibly obscured) in clusters than in the field particularly in the outskirts. These findings further support the idea that galaxy mergers and interactions may serve as mechanisms for the triggering and obscuration of AGN activity. The relatively high number of disturbed, merging, and possibly obscured AGN hosts in cluster outskirts suggests that galaxy merging and interactions are key drivers in triggering AGN activity in these outer regions of clusters.

  Cosmic rays (CRs) traversing the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be cooled through interactions with DM particles. In this study, we investigated constraints on sub-GeV DM particles charged under various $U(1)$ gauge symmetries by exploiting the cooling effect of CRs in AGNs. We find that for low DM and mediator masses, the CR cooling rate is higher compared to the standard model cooling process. Furthermore, by utilizing constraints from the CR cooling effect in NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, we explore the bounds on the DM-electron and DM-proton elastic scattering cross-sections. Our results indicate that in the sub-GeV DM mass range, these constraints are more stringent than those from certain boosted DM mechanisms and current direct detection limits.

  We present various properties of two bright extended Ly$\alpha$ objects, Himiko and CR7, at $z=6.6$ thoroughly investigated with JWST/NIRCam photometry, NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy, and ALMA data, uncovering their physical origins. Himiko (CR7) shows at least five (four) clumps with small separations of 2.4--7.3 kpc and velocity offsets of $\Delta v&lt;220~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ in the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ line maps, three of which exhibit stellar components with comparable stellar masses ranging in $\log{(M_*/M_\odot)}=8.4$--$9.0$ ($8.3$--$8.8$), indicative of major merger systems that are consistent with our numerical simulations. The [CII]158$\mu$m and Ly$\alpha$ lines are found in the middle of two clumps (the brightest clump) in Himiko (CR7), suggesting that the distribution of neutral gas does not always coincide with that of ionized gas or stars in merging processes. We find that some of the clumps have broad [OIII] components (250--400$~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) in Himiko and CR7, likely tracing outflow and tidal features, while the central clump in Himiko presents a broad H$\alpha$ ($\sim1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) line explained by an AGN with a low mass black hole of $M_\mathrm{BH}=10^{6.6}~M_\odot$, which contribute to the extended and bright nature of Himiko and CR7. We find low metallicities of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=$7.9--8.1 in Himiko and CR7 based on auroral [OIII]$\lambda4363$ and strong lines that are consistent with no 1-mm continuum detection corresponding to the dust mass limits of $M_\mathrm{dust}\lesssim 9\times 10^6 M_\odot$. Himiko and CR7 are metal- and dust-poor blue merger systems with stellar and dust masses $\gtrsim2$ orders of magnitude smaller than the massive dust-rich merger systems represented by submillimeter galaxies.

  We present the emission-line flux distributions and their ratios, as well as the gas outflow features, of the innermost 2 kpc region of the type 1 Seyfert galaxy Mrk 766, using the Kyoto Okayama Optical Low-dispersion Spectrograph with an optical-fiber integral field unit on the Seimei Telescope. We find that the central region of Mrk 766 is kinematically disturbed, exhibiting asymmetric and radially distributed AGN-driven ionized gas outflows traced by \OIII\ with velocities exceeding 500 \kms. The mass of the ionized gas outflow is estimated to be $10^{4.65-5.95} M_{\odot}$, and the mass outflow rate is $0.14-2.73$ M${\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This corresponds to a kinetic power, $\dot{E}_{\rm K}$, of $4.31 \times 10^{40} \ {\rm erg} \ {\rm s^{-1}}&lt; \dot{E}_{\rm K} &lt; 8.62 \times 10^{41} \ {\rm erg} \ {\rm s^{-1}}$, which is equivalent to $0.08\%-1.53\%$ of the bolometric luminosity, $L_{\rm bol}$. This result is consistent with other observed properties of ionized gas outflows, although it is lower than the theoretical predictions in AGN feedback models ($\sim5\%$), implying that ionized gas outflows traced by \OIII\ represent only a minor fraction of the total outflows ejected from the host galaxy. Given the asymmetric and radially distributed outflow signatures observed across the host galaxy within the limited field of view, the maximum distance the outflowing gas has traveled remains an open question.

  We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z_{spec} = 6.6379 \pm 0.0035$ with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$ mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$\alpha$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15 $\mu$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $z\gtrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.
