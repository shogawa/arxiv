  We identify galaxies hosting ionised-gas high-velocity outflows from the complete sample of medium resolution (R1000) JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). From a total sample of 1087 [OIII]5007 emitters we identify 40 galaxies with a blue-side broadened [OIII]5007 line at z=2.5-9. Of these, 34 are strong outflow candidates whilst 6 sources have broadening potentially driven by rotating clumps. Our outflow candidate sample is mainly composed of star-forming galaxies, including ~65% starbursts, which span the stellar mass range log10(M*/Msun)=7.5-11.0. It also includes two candidate type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a 'little red dot' (LRD). We report a median outflow velocity of 531(+146)(-159) km/s and an overall incidence rate of 3.4%. These values are significantly higher and lower respectively than recent similar works, which we accredit to the limiting resolution of the R1000 spectroscopy and a stricter outflow selection criterion. We find no correlation between the outflow velocity and the galaxy stellar mass or star-formation rate. The median ratio between outflow velocity and escape velocity is 0.77(+0.36)(-0.32), indicating that most outflows cannot escape the galaxy gravitational potentials. We do find an anti-correlation between mass loading factor and stellar mass up to M* ~(10^10)Msun, with most lowest stellar-mass M*&lt;(10^9)Msun galaxies reaching values well above unity, as is the case for local starburst galaxies.

  Nest200047 is a clear example of multiple radio bubbles from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in a galaxy group, featuring non-thermal filaments likely shaped by buoyancy, gas motions, and stabilized by magnetic fields. This study presents high-quality data obtained from uGMRT, MeerKAT, and VLA, alongside existing LOFAR data, to analyze the system's morphology and spectrum over a broad frequency range (53-1518 MHz). Our findings reveal new filamentary emission in the inner 60 kpc, surrounding and extending from the inner bubbles and jets, suggesting complex dynamical evolution of the non-thermal plasma in the group core. The filaments have widths of a few kpc and lengths from tens to hundreds of kpc, with a steep and curved radio spectrum ($\rm \alpha=1\sim2$). They exhibit a constant spectral index profile along their length, implying particles are either (re-)accelerated together or move at super-Alfvenic speeds. Spectral aging analysis yields jet active times between 50 and 100 Myr with short inactive phases, suggesting continuous energy injection typical of AGN feedback in galaxy groups. This study highlights the potential of combining high-quality radio data to understand recurrent jet activity and feedback, with implications for future research with the SKA observatory.

  We report the first detections of [Ne V] 14.3 {\mu}m and [Ne VI] 7.7 {\mu}m at high confidence (S/N&gt;=6) in the nuclear region of the nearby spiral galaxy M83. Emission line maps of these high ionization lines show several compact structures. Specifically, the [Ne VI] emission is located at 140 pc from the optical nucleus and appears as a point source of size ~&lt;18 pc (FWHM =&lt;0.8"). We investigate the possible source of this extreme emission through comparison with photoionization models and ancillary data. We find that photoionization models of fast radiative shocks are able to reproduce the observed high excitation emission line fluxes only for the lowest preshock density available in the library, n =0.01 cm^-3. Additionally, tailored active galactic nuclei (AGN) photoionization models assuming a two-zone structure are compatible with the observed high ionization fluxes. Our simple AGN model shows that the emission at the location of the [Ne VI] source can be the result of a cloud being ionized by the radiation cone of an AGN. We stress, however, that to definitively confirm an AGN as the main source of the observed emission, more complex modeling accounting for different geometries is required. Previously known as a purely starburst system, these new findings of the nuclear region of M83 will require a reassessment of its nature and of objects similar to it, particularly now that we have access to the unparalleled infrared sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to be variable sources across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, in particular at optical/ultraviolet and X-ray energies. Over the past decades, a growing number of AGN have displayed type transitions: from type 1 to type 2 or viceversa within a few years or even several months. These galaxies have been commonly referred to as changing-look AGN (CLAGN). Here we report on a new CLAGN, NGC 4614, which transitioned from a type 1.9 to a type 2 state. NGC 4614 is a nearly face-on barred galaxy at redshift $z = 0.016$, classified as a low-luminosity AGN. Its central black hole has a mass of about $1.6\times 10^7 M_\odot$ and an Eddington ratio around 1 percent. We recently acquired optical spectra of NGC 4614 at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and the data clearly suggest that the broad H$\alpha$ component has strongly dimmed, if not disappeared. A very recent Swift observation confirmed our current optical data, with the AGN weakened by almost a factor of 10 with respect to previous X-ray observations. Indeed, NGC 4614 had been also observed by Swift/XRT 6 times in 2011, when the source was clearly detected in all observations. By fitting the stack of the 2011 Swift observations we obtain a photon index of $\Gamma=1.3\pm0.3$ and an equivalent hydrogen column density of $N_{\rm H}$=$1.2\pm0.3$ $\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that NGC 4614 can be moderately absorbed in the X-rays. Although a significant change in the foreground gas absorption that may have obscured the broad line region cannot be entirely ruled out, the most likely explanation for our optical and X-ray data is that NGC 4614 is experiencing a change in the accretion state that reduces the radiative efficiency of the X-ray corona.

  It has been a decade since the IceCube collaboration began detecting high-energy (HE) neutrinos originating from cosmic sources. Despite a few well-known individual associations and numerous phenomenological, observational, and statistical multiwavelength studies, the origin of astrophysical HE neutrinos largely remains a mystery. To date, the most convincing associations link HE neutrinos with active galactic nuclei (AGN). Consequently, many studies have attempted population-based correlation tests between HE neutrinos and specific AGN subpopulations (such as blazars). While some of associations are suggestive, no definitive population-based correlation has been established. This could result from either a lack of a population-based correlation or insufficient detection power, given the substantial atmospheric neutrino background. By leveraging blazar variability, we performed spatio-temporal blazar-neutrino correlation tests aimed at enhancing detection power by reliably incorporating temporal information into the statistical analysis. We used simulations to evaluate the detection power of our method under various test strategies. We find that: (1) with sufficiently large source samples, if 20% of astrophysical HE neutrinos originate from blazars, we should robustly observe $\sim$4$\sigma$ associations; (2) a counting-based test-statistic combined with a top-hat weighting scheme (rather than a Gaussian one) provides the greatest detection power; (3) applying neutrino sample cuts reduces detection power when a weighting scheme is used; (4) in top-hat-like weighting schemes, small p-values do not occur arbitrarily with an increase in HE neutrino error region size (any such occurrence is indicative of an underlying blazar-neutrino correlation).
