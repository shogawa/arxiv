  We studied the ionized gas in the inner region ($\sim680\times470$ pc$^2$) of the galaxy NGC 6868 using Gemini/GMOS integral field unit observations. Channel maps reveal complex kinematics and morphology, indicating multiple processes at work in NGC 6868. Through emission-line fitting, we identified two ubiquitous components in our data: a narrow ($\sigma\sim110$ km s$^{-1}$) tracing an ionized gas disc and a broad component ($\sigma\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$) mainly associated with inflowing/outflowing gas. The derived V-band reddening shows a spatial distribution consistent with that obtained from stellar population synthesis, although with generally higher values. For the first time, we measured the electron temperature in NGC 6868, finding values ranging from $\sim 14000$ K in the central region to $\gtrsim20000$ K with an outward increasing temperature gradient. The electron density map exhibits an inverse relationship, with central values reaching $N_e\sim4000$ cm$^{-3}$ for the broad component decreasing to $N_e\sim100$ cm$^{-3}$ towards the edges of the field of view. Using BPT diagrams, we found that all spaxels are consistent with both AGN and shock ionization. However, when this information is combined with our kinematic and temperature findings, and further supported by the WHAN diagram, we argue that an AGN is the dominant ionisation mechanism in the central region of NGC 6868, while the extended outer component is ionized by a combination of hot low-mass evolved stars and shocks. According to our findings, shocks play a significant role in the ionization balance of this galaxy.

  The masses of galaxy clusters are commonly measured from X-ray observations under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE). This technique is known to underestimate the true mass systematically. The fiducial FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulation predicts the median hydrostatic mass bias to increase from $b_\text{HSE} \equiv (M_\text{HSE,500c}-M_\text{500c})/M_\text{500c} \approx -0.1$ to -0.2 when the true mass increases from group to cluster mass scales. However, the bias is nearly independent of the hydrostatic mass. The scatter at fixed true mass is minimum for $M_\text{500c}\sim 10^{14}~\text{M}_\odot$, where $\sigma(b_\text{HSE})\approx 0.1$, but increases rapidly towards lower and higher masses. At a fixed true mass, the hydrostatic masses increase (decrease) with redshift on group (cluster) scales, and the scatter increases. The bias is insensitive to the choice of analytic functions assumed to represent the density and temperature profiles, but it is sensitive to the goodness of fit, with poorer fits corresponding to a stronger median bias and a larger scatter. The bias is also sensitive to the strength of stellar and AGN feedback. Models predicting lower gas fractions yield more (less) biased masses for groups (clusters). The scatter in the bias at fixed true mass is due to differences in the pressure gradients rather than in the temperature at $R_\text{500c}$. The total kinetic energies within $r_\text{500c}$ in low- and high-mass clusters are sub- and super-virial, respectively, though all become sub-virial when external pressure is accounted for. Analyses of the terms in the virial and Euler equations suggest that non-thermal motions, including rotation, account for most of the hydrostatic mass bias. However, we find that the mass bias estimated from X-ray luminosity weighted profiles strongly overestimates the deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium.   

Extremely Dense Gas around Little Red Dots and High-redshift AGNs: A
  Non-stellar Origin of the Balmer Break and Absorption Features

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts of $z\gtrsim 4-7$, powered by accreting black holes (BHs) with masses of $\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$. These AGN populations are considered crucial for understanding early BH assembly and coevolution with their host galaxies. One remarkable distinction of these JWST-identified AGNs, compared to their low-redshift counterparts, is that at least $\sim 20\%$ of them present H$\alpha$ and/or H$\beta$ absorption, which must be associated with extremely dense ($\gtrsim 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$) gas along the line of sight. These Balmer absorption features unavoidably imply the presence of a Balmer break caused by the same dense gas. In this Letter, we quantitatively demonstrate that a Balmer-break feature can form in AGN spectra without stellar components, when the accretion disk is heavily embedded in dense neutral gas clumps with densities of $\sim 10^{9-11}$ cm$^{-3}$, where hydrogen atoms are collisionally excited to the $n=2$ states and effectively absorb the AGN continuum at the bluer side of the Balmer limit. The non-stellar origin of a Balmer break offers a potential solution to the large stellar masses and densities inferred for little red dots (LRDs) when assuming that their continuum is primarily due to stellar light. Our calculations of hydrogen-level populations indicate that the observed Balmer absorption blueshifted by a few hundreds km s$^{-1}$ suggests the presence of dense outflows at parsec scales in the nucleus. The outflow rate likely exceeds the Eddington accretion rate, driven by powerful radiation from a super-Eddington accretion disk. Other spectral features such as higher equivalent widths of broad H$\alpha$ emission and presence of OI lines observed in high-redshift AGNs including LRDs align with the predicted signatures of a dense super-Eddington accretion disk.

  We investigate the star formation-AGN connection in the Seyfert 1 NGC 7469 using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mid-infrared spectroscopic integral field unit (IFU) data. We use the IFU data to generate maps of different emission lines present in the spectrum, such as the star-formation (SF) tracer [Ne II] 12.81{\mu}m, or the AGN tracer [Ne V] 14.32{\mu}m. We can separate the AGN- and SF-dominated regions using spatially resolved mid-IR diagnostic diagrams, and further investigate the ionization sources powering each region by constructing photoionization models. We find that the previously detected eastern wind populates an intermediary region of the diagrams, between our star-forming and AGN quadrants. This wind also coincides with a reduction in the [Ne II] emission in the ring, which suggests that the ionization cone intersects the ring in this direction. In spite of this evidence of negative AGN feedback, given the narrow opening angle of the ionization cone and its orientation, this would not be a case of efficient feedback.   

Clues of the restarting active galactic nucleus activity of Mrk 1498

  Some giant radio galaxies selected at X-rays with an AGN show signs of a restarted nuclear activity. One object in this peculiar class is Mrk1498, a giant low-frequency double radio source that shows extended emission in [OIII]. This emission is likely related to the history of the nuclear activity of the galaxy. We investigate whether this bubble-like emission might trace an outflow from either present or past AGN activity. Using MEGARA/GTC, medium-resolution spectroscopy (R 10000) data, we obtained the kinematics and fluxes of the ionised gas from modelling the [OIII] and Hbeta features.with three kinematic components. All the components show an overall blue to red velocity pattern, with similar peak-to-peak velocities but a different velocity dispersion. At a galactocentric distance of 2.3 kpc, we found a blob with a velocity up to 100km/s, and a high velocity dispersion (170km/s) that is spatially coincident with the direction of the radio jet. The observed [OIII]/Hbeta line ratio indicates possible ionisation from AGN or shocks nearly everywhere. The clumpy structure visibile in HST images at kpc scales show the lowest values of log[OIII]/Hbeta , which is likely not related to the photoionisation by the AGN. Taking optical and radio activity into account, we propose a scenario of two different ionised gas features over the radio AGN lifecycle of Mrk 1498. The radio emission suggests at least two main radio activity episodes: an old episode at Mpc scales (formed during a time span of 100Myr), and a new episode from the core (&gt;2000yr ago). At optical wavelengths, we observe clumps and a blob that are likely associated with fossil outflow. The latter is likely powered by past episodes of the flickering AGN activity that may have occurred between the two main radio phases.
