  We present a study of a sample of 45 spectroscopically confirmed, UV luminous galaxies at $z\sim 6$. They were selected as bright Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) using deep multi-band optical images in more than 2 deg$^2$ of the sky, and subsequently identified via their strong Ly$\alpha$ emission. The majority of these LBGs span an absolute UV magnitude range from $-22.0$ to $-20.5$ mag with Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW) between $\sim$10 and $\sim$200 \AA, representing the most luminous galaxies at $z\sim 6$ in terms of both UV continuum emission and Ly$\alpha$ line emission. We model the SEDs of 10 LBGs that have deep infrared observations from HST, JWST, and/or Spitzer, and find that they have a wide range of stellar masses and ages. They also have high star-formation rates ranging from a few tens to a few hundreds of Solar mass per year. Five of the LBGs have JWST or HST images and four of them show compact morphology in these images, including one that is roughly consistent with a point source, suggesting that UV luminous galaxies at this redshift are generally compact. The fraction of our photometrically selected LBGs with strong Ly$\alpha$ emission ($\mathrm{EW}&gt;25$ \AA) is about $0.2$, which is consistent with previous results and supports a moderate evolution of the IGM opacity at the end of cosmic reionization. Using deep X-ray images, we do not find evidence of strong AGN activity in these galaxies, but our constraint is loose and we are not able to rule out the possibility of any weak AGN activity.

  There is compelling evidence that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in high-density regions have undergone a different evolution than their counterparts in the field, indicating that they are strongly affected by their environment. To investigate the various factors that may affect the prevalence of AGNs in cluster galaxies, we selected a sample of 19 thoroughly studied X-ray-selected galaxy clusters from the LoCuSS survey. All these clusters are considered massive, with $M_{500}\gtrsim 2\times10^{14} M_{solar}$, and span a narrow redshift range between $z\sim$0.16 and 0.28. We divided the cluster surroundings into two concentric annuli with a width of $R_{500}$ radius. We further divided the cluster sample based on the presence of infalling X-ray-detected groups, cluster mass, or dynamical state. We found that the X-ray AGN fraction in the outskirts is consistent with the field, but it is significantly lower in cluster centres, in agreement with previous results for massive clusters. We show that these results do not depend on cluster mass. Furthermore, we did not find any evidence of a spatial correlation between infalling groups and AGNs. Nevertheless, a significant excess of X-ray AGNs is found in the outskirts of relaxed clusters at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level, compared both to non-relaxed clusters and to the field. Our results suggest that the mechanisms that trigger AGN activity may vary between cluster centres and the outskirts. Ram pressure can efficiently remove the gas from infalling galaxies, thereby triggering AGN activity in some cases. However, the reduced availability of gas globally diminishes the fraction of AGNs in cluster centers. The surplus of X-ray AGNs identified in the outskirts of relaxed clusters may be attributed to an increased frequency of galaxy mergers, a notion that is further supported by the disturbed morphology observed in several galaxies.   

Jets, Outflows, and Explosions in Massive Star Formation

  Multispectral studies of nearby, forming stars provide insights into all classes of accreting systems. Objects which have magnetic fields, spin, and accrete produce jets and collimated outflows. Jets are seen in systems ranging from brown dwarf stars to supermassive black holes. Outflow speeds are typically a few times the escape speed from the launch region - 100s of \kms\ for young stars to nearly the speed of light for black-holes. Because many young stellar objects (YSOs) are nearby, we can see outflow evolution and measure proper motions on times scales of years. Because the shocks in YSO outflows emit in atoms, ions, and molecules in addition to the continuum, many physical properties such as temperatures, densities, and velocities can be measured. Momenta and kinetic energies can be computed. YSO outflows are a major source of feedback in the self-regulation of star formation. The lessons learned can be applied to much more distant and energetic cosmic sources such as AGN and galactic nuclear super winds - systems in which evolution occurs on time-scales of hundreds to millions of years. Some dense star-forming regions produce powerful explosions. The nearest massive star-forming region, Orion OMC1, powered a $\sim 10^{48}$ erg explosion about 550 years ago (that is when the light from the event would have reached the Solar System). The OMC1 explosion was likely powered by an N-body interaction which resulted in the formation of a compact, AU-scale binary or resulted in a protostellar merger. The binary or merger remnant, the $\sim$15 \Msol\ object known as radio source I (Src I) was ejected from the core with a speed of $\sim$10 \kms\ along with two other stars. The $\sim$10~\Msol\ BN object was ejected with $\sim$30~\kms\ and a $\sim$3~\Msol\ star was ejected with $\sim$55~\kms .

  We identified Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) candidates as counterparts to unidentified gamma-ray sources (UGS) from the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalogue at lower Galactic latitudes. Our methodology is based on the use of near- and mid-infrared photometric data from the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) surveys. The AGN candidates associated with the UGS occupy very different regions from the stars and extragalactic sources in the colour space defined by the VVV and WISE infrared colours. We found 27 near-infrared AGN candidates possibly associated with 14 Fermi-LAT sources using the VVV survey. We also found 2 blazar candidates in the regions of 2 Fermi-LAT sources using WISE data. There is no match between VVV and WISE candidates. We have also examined the K$_\mathrm{s}$ light curves of the VVV candidates and applied the fractional variability amplitude ($\mathrm{\sigma_{rms}}$) and the slope of variation in the K$_\mathrm{s}$ passband to characterise the near-infrared variability. This analysis shows that more than 85% of the candidates have slopes in the K$_\mathrm{s}$ passband $ &gt; 10^{-4}$ mag/day and present $\mathrm{\sigma_{rms}}$ values consistent with a moderate variability. This is in good agreement with typical results seen from type-1 AGN. The combination of YJHK$_\mathrm{s}$ colours and K$_\mathrm{s}$ variability criteria was useful for AGN selection, including its use in identifying counterparts to Fermi $\gamma$-ray sources.

  We report the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae discovery of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-23bd (AT 2023clx) in NGC 3799, a LINER galaxy with no evidence of strong AGN activity over the past decade. With a redshift of $z = 0.01107$ and a peak UV/optical luminosity of $(5.4\pm0.4)\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, ASASSN-23bd is the lowest-redshift and least-luminous TDE discovered to date. Spectroscopically, ASASSN-23bd shows H$\alpha$ and He I emission throughout its spectral time series, and the UV spectrum shows nitrogen lines without the strong carbon and magnesium lines typically seen for AGN. Fits to the rising ASAS-SN light curve show that ASASSN-23bd started to brighten on MJD 59988$^{+1}_{-1}$, $\sim$9 days before discovery, with a nearly linear rise in flux, peaking in the $g$ band on MJD $60000^{+3}_{-3}$. Scaling relations and TDE light curve modelling find a black hole mass of $\sim$10$^6$ $M_\odot$, which is on the lower end of supermassive black hole masses. ASASSN-23bd is a dim X-ray source, with an upper limit of $L_{0.3-10\,\mathrm{keV}} &lt; 1.0\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from stacking all \emph{Swift} observations prior to MJD 60061, but with soft ($\sim 0.1$ keV) thermal emission with a luminosity of $L_{0.3-2 \,\mathrm{keV}}\sim4\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in \emph{XMM-Newton} observations on MJD 60095. The rapid $(t &lt; 15$ days) light curve rise, low UV/optical luminosity, and a luminosity decline over 40 days of $\Delta L_{40}\approx-0.7$ make ASASSN-23bd one of the dimmest TDEs to date and a member of the growing ``Low Luminosity and Fast'' class of TDEs.

  The Galactic electron density model NE2001 describes the multicomponent ionized structure of the Milky Way interstellar medium. NE2001 forward models the dispersion and scattering of compact radio sources, including pulsars, fast radio bursts, AGNs, and masers, and the model is routinely used to predict the distances of radio sources lacking independent distance measures. Here we present the open-source package NE2001p, a fully Python implementation of NE2001. The model parameters are identical to NE2001 but the computational architecture is optimized for Python, yielding small (&lt;1%) numerical differences between NE2001p and the Fortran code. NE2001p can be used on the command-line and through Python scripts available on PyPI. Future package releases will include modular extensions aimed at providing short-term improvements to model accuracy, including a modified thick disk scale height and additional clumps and voids. This implementation of NE2001 is a springboard to a next-generation Galactic electron density model now in development.
