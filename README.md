  We present new frontiers in the modelling of the spectral energy distributions (SED) of active galaxies by introducing the radio-to-X-ray fitting capabilities of the publicly available Bayesian code AGNfitter. The new code release, called AGNfitter-rx, models the broad-band photometry covering the radio, infrared (IR), optical, ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray bands consistently, using a combination of theoretical and semi-empirical models of the AGN and host galaxy emission. This framework enables the detailed characterization of four physical components of the active nuclei: the accretion disk, the hot dusty torus, the relativistic jets/core radio emission, and the hot corona; alongside modeling three components within the host galaxy: stellar populations, cold dust, and the radio emission from the star-forming regions. Applying AGNfitter-rx to a diverse sample of 36 AGN SEDs at z&lt;0.7 from the AGN SED ATLAS, we investigate and compare the performance of state-of-the-art torus and accretion disk emission models on fit quality and inferred physical parameters. We find that clumpy torus models that include polar winds and semi-empirical accretion disk templates including emission line features significantly increase the fit quality in 67% of the sources, by effectively reducing by $2\sigma$ fit residuals in the $1.5-5 \mu \rm m$ and $0.7 \mu \rm m$ regimes.We demonstrate that, by applying AGNfitter-rx on photometric data, we are able to estimate inclination and opening angles of the torus, consistent with spectroscopic classifications within the AGN unified model, as well as black hole mass estimates in agreement with virial estimates based on H$\alpha$. The wavelength coverage and the flexibility for the inclusion of state-of-the-art theoretical models make AGNfitter-rx a unique tool for the further development of SED modelling for AGNs in present and future radio-to-X-ray galaxy surveys.

  The energy coupling efficiency of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts is known to differ significantly with factors including the jet kinetic power, duration of the outburst, and properties of the host galaxy cluster. As such, constraints on their jet power and lifetime functions are crucial to quantify the role of kinetic-mode AGN feedback on the evolution of galaxies since $z \sim 1$. In this work, we address this issue by measuring the energetics of a sample of 79 low-redshift (0.02 $&lt; z &lt;$ 0.2) remnant radio galaxies compiled from large-sky radio surveys - these objects uniquely probe the full duration of an AGN outburst. The jet kinetic power and outburst duration of each remnant are determined using the RAiSE dynamical model based on the surface brightness distribution observed in multi-frequency radio images. We compare the energetics constrained for this sample to those predicted for mock radio source populations - with various intrinsic functions for jet power and lifetime distributions - to correct for sample selection biases imposed on our sample. The intrinsic jet power and lifetime functions that yield a selection-biased mock population most similar to our observed sample are found using Bayesian inference. Our analysis places robust constraints on assumed power-law indices for the intrinsic jet power and lifetime functions: $p(Q)\propto Q^{-1.49\pm0.07}$ and $p(t_{\mathrm{on}})\propto t_{\mathrm{on}}^{-0.97\pm0.12}$ respectively. We discuss the implication of these findings for feedback-regulated accretion and the self-regulating nature of jet activity. The methodology proposed in this work can be extended to active radio galaxies in future studies.

  To investigate the short-term variability and determine the size of the optical continuum emitting size of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we carried out high-cadence, multi-band photometric monitoring of a Seyfert 1 galaxy J0249-0815 across two nights, together with a one-night single-band preliminary test. The presence of the broad Ha component in our target was confirmed by recent Palomar/P200 spectroscopic observations, 23 years after Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ruling out the supernovae origin of the broad Ha line. The photometric experiment was primarily conducted utilizing four-channel imagers MuSCAT 3 &amp; 4 mounted on 2-meter telescopes within the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Despite the expectation of variability, we observed no significant variation (&lt;1.4%) on timescales of 6-10 hours. This non-detection is likely due to substantial host galaxy light diluting the subtle AGN variability. Dual-band preliminary tests and tailored simulations may enhance the possibility of detecting variability and lag in future IMBH reverberation campaigns.

  Reverberation mapping accurately determines virial black hole masses only for redshifts $z &lt;$ 0.2 by utilizing the relationship between the H$\beta$ broad-line region (BLR) size and the 5100 Angstroms continuum luminosity established with $\sim 200$ active galactic nuclei (AGN). For quasars at $z \sim 2-3$ determining the BLR size is time-consuming and limited by seasonal gaps, requiring e.g., $\sim$ 20 years of monitoring of the CIV emission lines. In this work, we demonstrate that an efficient alternative is to use a continuum size-luminosity relation, which can be obtained up to 150 times faster than BLR sizes using photometric reverberation mapping (PRM). We outline the method and its feasibility based on simulations and propose an observational strategy that can be carried out with meter-class telescopes. In particular, we focus on the ESO La Silla 2.2 meter telescope as it is suitable for an efficient PRM campaign. These observations will provide the scaling factor between the accretion disk and the BLR size (for CIV-1350 Angstroms), which is crucial for estimating the masses of black holes at higher redshifts ($z \gtrsim 2-3$).

  Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ejected from their galactic centers due to gravitational wave recoil or the slingshot mechanism following a galaxy merger. If an ejected SMBH retains its inner accretion disk, it may be visible as an off-nuclear active galactic nucleus (AGN). At present, only a handful of offset AGNs that are recoil or slingshot candidates have been found, and none have been robustly confirmed. Compiling a large sample of runaway SMBHs would enable us to constrain the mass and spin evolution of binary SMBHs and study feedback effects of displaced AGNs. We adapt the method of varstrometry -- which was developed for Gaia observations to identify off-center, dual, and lensed AGNs -- in order to quickly identify off-nuclear AGNs in optical survey data by looking for an excess of blue versus red astrometric jitter. We apply this to the Pan-STARRS1 3pi Survey and report on five new runaway AGN candidates. We focus on ZTF18aajyzfv: a luminous quasar offset by 6.7 $\pm$ 0.2 kpc from an adjacent galaxy at $z$=0.224, and conclude after Keck LRIS spectroscopy and comparison to ASTRID simulation analogs that it is likely a dual AGN. This selection method can be easily adapted to work with data from the soon-to-be commissioned Vera C. Rubin Telescope Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). LSST will have a higher cadence and deeper magnitude limit than Pan-STARRS1, and should permit detection of many more runaway SMBH candidates.

  In this study, we utilize a sample of 338 galaxies within the redshift range of $\rm 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.1$, drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), for which there are available classifications, based on their emission line ratios. We, further, identify and select Compton-thick (CT) AGN through the use of X-ray and infrared luminosities at $12\,\mu m$. We construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all sources and fit them using the CIGALE code to derive properties related to both the AGN and host galaxies. Employing stringent criteria to ensure the reliability of SED measurements, our final sample comprises 14 CT AGN, 118 Seyfert 2 (Sy2), 82 composite, and 124 LINER galaxies. Our analysis reveals that, irrespective of their classification, the majority of the sources lie below the star-forming main-sequence (MS). Additionally, a lower level of AGN activity is associated with a closer positioning to the MS. Utilizing the D$_n$4000 spectral index as a proxy for the age of stellar populations, we observe that LINERs exhibit the oldest stellar populations compared to other AGN classes. Conversely, CT sources are situated in galaxies with the youngest stellar populations. Furthermore, LINER and composite galaxies tend to show the lowest accretion efficiency, while CT AGN, on average, display the most efficient accretion among the four AGN populations. Our findings are consistent with a scenario in which the different AGN populations might not originate from the same AGN activity burst. Early triggers in gas rich environments can create high accretion rate SMBHs leading to a progression from CT to Sy2, while later triggers in gas poor stages result in low accretion rate SMBHs like those found in LINERs.
