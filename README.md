  We present results from our EVN and GMRT observations of the radio continuum and spectral line emission in IRAS 17526+3253, along with an analysis of its arcsecond-scale radio properties using archival VLA data. The EVN observations detected radio continuum emission from both the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) nuclei. The NW nucleus shows two components with high brightness temperatures and radio luminosities, likely indicating the presence of an AGN core and jet. Meanwhile, our EVN observation failed to detect the OH line emission, possibly due to radio frequency interference and/or the emission being partly resolved out and below our detection limit. The multi-band radio spectral energy distribution (SED) deviates from a single power-law at low frequencies, suggesting low-frequency absorption. The GMRT spectral line data reveal both \HI absorption and emission. The \HI emission is diffuse and shows a velocity gradient from about 7500 \kms in the NW to 7800 \kms in the SE nucleus. On larger scales, the \HI emission extends about 4' along the NW-SE direction, with the southeastern extension matching the optical tidal tail. In addition, the weak \HI absorption features show broad line profiles, possibly due to overlapping \HI gas from the two nuclei. The aforementioned results are consistent with properties of intermediate-stage mergers reported in the literature.   

A long time ago in an LAE far, far away: a signpost of early

  The JADES survey recently reported the discovery of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA at $z = 13$, the highest redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) ever observed. This observation suggests that either the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is highly ionized, or the galaxy's intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission properties are extreme. We use radiative transfer simulations of reionization that capture the distribution of ionized gas in the $z = 13$ IGM to investigate the implications of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA for reionization. We find that if JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is a typical star forming galaxy (SFG) with properties characteristic of LAEs at $z \sim 6$, its detection suggests that the universe is $\gtrsim 5\%$ ionized by $z = 13$. We also investigate the possibility that the extreme properties of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA are driven by an AGN. Using a simple analysis based on the fact that AGN are expected to produce more ionizing photons than SFGs, we estimate that the likelihood that JADES-GS-z13-1-LA hosts an AGN is $88\%$, $66\%$, and $33\%$ if the IGM is $&lt; 1\%$, $\approx 5\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ ionized, respectively. We also highlight other features in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA that may be indicative of AGN activity, including strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption extending to $\sim 1300$ angstroms, and a possible CII*$\lambda1335$ emission line. Our findings strongly motivate dedicated follow-up observations of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA to determine whether it hosts an AGN.

  In this study, a new semi-empirical calibration is proposed between ultraviolet emission lines (\ion{C}{iii}]$\lambda1909$, \ion{C}{iv}$\lambda1549$, \ion{He}{ii}]$\lambda1640$) of type~2 AGNs and their metallicity ($Z$). This calibration is derived by comparing a large sample of 106 objects (data taken from the literature) located over a wide range of redshifts ($0 \: \lesssim \: z \: \lesssim \: 4.0$) with predictions from photoionization models that adopt a recent C/O-O/H relation derived via estimates using the $T_{\rm e}$ method, which is considered the most reliable method. We found that the new calibration produces $Z$ values in agreement (within an uncertainty of $\pm 0.1$ dex) with those from other calibrations and from estimates via the $T_{\rm e}$-method. We find also that AGN metallicities are already high at early epochs, with no evidence for monotonic evolution across the redshift range $0 \: \lesssim \: z \: \lesssim \: 12$. Notably, the highest metallicities in our sample, reaching up to $\rm 4\: Z_{\odot}$, are found in objects at $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$. This redshift range coincides with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate history, suggesting a strong connection between the major epoch of star formation, black hole growth, and rapid metal enrichment in the host galaxies of AGNs. Furthermore, our analysis reveals no significant correlation between AGN metallicity and radio properties (radio spectral index or radio luminosity) or host galaxy stellar mass. The lack of a clear mass-metallicity relation, consistent with findings for local AGNs, suggests that the chemical evolution of the nuclear gas is decoupled from the global properties of the host galaxy.
