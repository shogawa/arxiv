  In this paper, we propose a novel minimal physical model to elucidate the long-term stochastic variability of blazars. The model is built on the realistic background of magnetized plasma jets dissipating energy through a turbulent cascade process that transfers energy to small-scale structures with highly anisotropic radiation. The model demonstrates the ability to spontaneously generate variability features consistent with observations of blazars under uniformly random fluctuations in the underlying physical parameters. This indicates that the model possesses self-similarity across multiple time scales, providing a natural explanation for the universal power spectral density (PSD) structure observed in different types of blazars. Moreover, the model exhibits that when the cascade process produces a relatively flat blob energy distribution, the spectral index of the model-simulated PSD in the high-frequency regime will be steeper than that predicted by the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model, which is in agreement with recent observations of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability, providing a plausible theoretical explanation. The model is also able to reproduce the observed fractional variability amplitude (FVA) characteristics of blazars, and suggests that the specific particle acceleration and radiative cooling processes within the blob may not be the key factor shaping the long-term stochastic variability. This minimal model provides a new physical perspective for understanding the long-term stochastic variability of blazars.

  We set the stage for reassessing how star formation, emission-line nebulae, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) depend on the thermodynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM). Our work is based on the 25 clusters observed in the CLASH program for which the aforementioned attributes in their BCGs can be well scrutinized, as has the thermodynamics of their ICM. Nine of these BCGs display complex UV morphologies tracing recent star formation, whereas the remaining 16 are characterized by a relatively compact central UV enhancement. Here, we show definitively that three of the latter BCGs also display star formation, whereas the diffuse UV of the remaining 13 is entirely consistent with old low-mass stars. The overall results support the previously established dependence of star formation and nebulae in BCGs on an "excess core entropy," K$_{0}$, for the ICM: all 11 clusters with K$_{0}$ $\leq$ 24 keV cm$^{2}$ (but only one of 14 clusters with K$_{0}$ $\geq$ 42 keV cm$^{2}$) host star-forming BCGs that almost if not always possess nebulae. Instead of an entropy floor, we show that K$_{0}$ reflects the degree to which the radial entropy profile decreases inward within $\sim$100 kpc rather than (except perhaps at large K$_{0}$) actually flattening: clusters with lower ICM entropies and hence shorter cooling times at their cores preferentially host BCGs displaying star formation, nebulae, and more radio-luminous AGNs. Nearly all BCGs possess detectable AGNs, however, indicating multiple pathways for fuelling their AGNs.

  High-redshift radio(-loud) galaxies (H$z$RGs) are massive galaxies with powerful radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and serve as beacons for protocluster identification. However, the interplay between H$z$RGs and the large-scale environment remains unclear. To understand the connection between H$z$RGs and the surrounding obscured star formation, we investigated the overdensity and spatial distribution of submillimeter-bright galaxies (SMGs) in the field of 4C\,23.56, a well-known H$z$RG at $z=2.48$. We used SCUBA-2 data ($\sigma\,{\sim}\,0.6$\,mJy) to estimate the $850\,{\rm \mu m}$ source number counts and examine the radial and azimuthal overdensities of the $850\,{\rm \mu m}$ sources in the vicinity of the H$z$RG. The angular distribution of SMGs is inhomogeneous around the H$z$RG 4C\,23.56, with fewer sources oriented along the radio jet. We also find a significant overdensity of bright SMGs (${\rm S}_{850\rm\,\mu m}\geq5\,$mJy). Faint and bright SMGs exhibit different spatial distributions. The former are concentrated in the core region, while the latter prefer the outskirts of the H$z$RG field. High-resolution observations show that the seven brightest SMGs in our sample are intrinsically bright, suggesting that the overdensity of bright SMGs is less likely due to the source multiplicity.
