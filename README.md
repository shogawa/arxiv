  Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations are ideal laboratories where the evolution of the cosmic web can be studied. This allows for easier insight into the nature of the filaments. We investigate how the intrinsic properties of filaments are evolving in areas extracted from a larger cosmological simulation. We aim to identify significant trends in the properties of Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) and suggest possible explanations. To study the filaments and their contents, we select a subset of regions from the Dianoga simulation. We analysed these regions that were simulated with different baryon physics, namely with and without the AGN feedback. We construct the cosmic web using the Sub-space Constrained Mean Shift (SCMS) algorithm and the Sequential Chain Algorithm for Resolving Filaments (SCARF). We examined the basic physical properties of filaments (length, shape, mass, radius) and analysed different gas phases (hot, WHIM and colder gas components) within those structures. The evolution of the global filament properties and the properties of the gas phases were studied in the redshift range $0 &lt; z &lt; 1.48$. Within our simulations, the detected filaments have, on average, lengths below $9$ Mpc. The filaments' shape correlates with their length; the longer they are, the more likely they are curved. We find that the scaling relation between mass $M$ and length $L$ of the filaments is well described by the power law $M \propto L^{1.7}$. The radial density profile is widening with redshift, meaning that the radius of the filaments is getting larger over time. The fraction of gas mass in the WHIM phase does not depend on the model and is rising towards lower redshifts. However, the included baryon physics has a strong impact on the metallicity of gas in filaments, indicating that the AGN feedback impacts the metal content already at redshifts of $z \sim 2$.

  Statistical analyses based on the spatial correlation between the sky maps of Gravitational Wave (GW) events and the positions of potential host environments are a powerful tool to infer the origin of the black hole binary mergers that have been detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA instruments. In this paper, we tighten our previous constraints on the fraction of detected GW events that may have originated from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We consider 159 mergers detected not later than June 1st, 2024, and the all-sky quasar catalogue Quaia. We increase by a factor of 5.3 and 114 the number of considered GW sources and AGN respectively, also extending our analysis from redshift 0.3 to 1.5. This is possible thanks to the uniformity of the AGN catalogue and its high level of completeness, which we estimate as a function of redshift and luminosity. We find at a 95 per cent credibility level that un-obscured AGN with a bolometric luminosity higher than $10^{44.5}{\rm erg\ s}^{-1}$ ($10^{45}{\rm erg\ s}^{-1}$) do not contribute to more than the 21 (11) per cent of the detected GW events.

  Measuring the environments of massive galaxies at high redshift is crucial to understanding galaxy evolution and the conditions that gave rise to the distribution of matter we see in the Universe today. While high-$z$ radio galaxies (H$z$RGs) and quasars tend to reside in protocluster-like systems, the environments of their radio-quiet counterparts are relatively unexplored, particularly in the submillimetre, which traces dust-obscured star formation. In this study we search for 850 $\mu$m-selected submillimetre galaxies in the environments of massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), radio-quiet ($L_{500 {\rm MHz}} \lesssim 10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) galaxies at $z \sim 1\text{--}3$ in COSMOS. By constructing number counts in circular regions of radius 1--6 arcmin and comparing with blank-field measurements, we find no significant overdensities of SMGs around massive radio-quiet galaxies at any of these scales, despite being sensitive down to overdensities of $\delta \sim 0.4$. To probe deeper than the catalogue we also examine the distribution of peaks in the SCUBA-2 SNR map, which reveals only tentative signs of any difference in the SMG densities of the radio-quiet galaxy environments compared to the blank field, and only on smaller scales (1$^{\prime}$ radii, corresponding to $\sim0.5$ Mpc) and higher SNR thresholds. We conclude that massive, radio-quiet galaxies at cosmic noon are typically in environments with $\delta\lesssim0.4$, which are either consistent with the blank field or contain only weak overdensities spanning sub-Mpc scales. The contrast between our results and studies of H$z$RGs with similar stellar masses and redshifts implies an intrinsic link between the wide-field environment and radio AGN luminosity at high redshift.

  In the past, high-z AGNs were given a minor role as possible drivers of reionization, despite initial evidences in favor of their large space densities at low luminosities by Chandra and HST. Recent observations from JWST are finding relatively large numbers of faint AGNs at z&gt;4, convincingly confirming these early results. We present a sample of z~5 AGNs (both from wide, shallow ground-based surveys and from deep, pencil-beam observations from JWST), allowing to estimate their space densities with unprecedented accuracy. The bright end (M1450&lt;-26) of the z~5 AGN luminosity function is well constrained, with a rather steep slope. The faint end (M1450&gt;-22) indicates a high space density, the scatter is significant and the knee (M1450~-24) is mostly undetermined. Comparisons with state-of-the-art models find reasonable agreement with the observed AGN luminosity function at z=5, while the predicted space density evolution at higher redshifts appears to be too fast with respect to observational constraints. Given the large variance at the faint end, we consider different options in fitting the luminosity functions and deriving the ionizing emissivity. Even in the most conservative scenario, the photo-ionization rate produced by z~5 AGNs is consistent with the UV background measurements. A slow evolution of the space density of faint AGNs is observed, indicating that active SMBHs are probably producing large amounts of ionizing photons at z&gt;6, well into the epoch of reionization. This is an important indication that high-z AGNs could be the major contributors to the reionization of the Universe.

  In this manuscript, strong clues are reported to support the normal broad line AGN SDSS J1617+0638 as the host galaxy harboring a central tidal disruption event (TDE). Through the optical flare in the CSS 8.5years-long light curve and the none-variability in the up-to-date ASAS-SN light curves, the theoretical TDE model described by the MOSFIT code can be applied in SDSS J1617+0638. Meanwhile, considering the assumed central TDE expected continuum emissions not strong enough to describe the continuum emissions in the SDSS spectrum of SDSS J1617+0638, an additional power law component from pre-existing AGN activity should be necessary in SDSS J1617+0638. Furthermore, considering the short time duration to the observed date for the SDSS spectrum from the starting time of the assumed central TDE in SDSS J1617+0638, TDE model expected accreting mass only about 0.03$M_\odot$ can lead to few effects of TDEs debris on the observed broad emission lines in the SDSS spectrum of SDSS J1617+0638, indicating the TDE model determined BH mass simply consistent with the virial BH mass by broad emission lines, as determined results in SDSS J1617+0638. Therefore, through both the photometric variability and the spectroscopic results, a central TDE can be preferred in the normal broad line AGN SDSS J1617+0638 with pre-existing central AGN activity and pre-existing broad emission line regions.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a ubiquitous population of dust-obscured compact sources at $z\gtrsim 4$. Many of these objects exhibit signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, making their study crucial for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their growth with host galaxies. In this work, we examine low and medium resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the JADES GTO public data release in the GOODS-N field of a red, luminous ($M_{\rm B}\sim-22.2$ mag) and compact ($&lt;500$ pc) source at $z=4.13$. The rest-optical ($\lambda_{\rm rest} &gt; 4000$ A) continuum of this source is strongly dominated by a massive (log$_{10}$[$M_*/M_\odot] \sim 10.6$), quenched (log$_{10}$[sSFR/yr$^{-1}$] $&lt; -11$) galaxy, as indicated by the clear presence of a Balmer break and stellar absorption lines. Star-formation history modeling reveals a starburst episode followed by rapid quenching about 200 Myr ago. The spectrum shows extremely broad (FWHM $\sim 2500$ km/s) H$\alpha$ emission and elevated optical line ratios, indicating an actively accreting SMBH. Moreover, our work has potentially revealed clear AGN signatures in the rest-UV in LRDs for the first time, via a detection of a strong Ly$\alpha$ emission and a broad MgII, doublet. The derived black hole mass of log$_{10}$($M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) \sim 7.3$ results in $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\sim 0.04$ %, consistent with the local relations, unlike the elevated ratios in other high-$z$ reddened AGN. Finally, we use JWST data from AGN at $z=4-10$ to explore an evolutionary link between high-$z$ reddened AGN, early quiescent galaxies, and local ellipticals.
