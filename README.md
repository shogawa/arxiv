  Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) power active galactic nuclei (AGN). The vicinity of the SMBH has long been proposed as the potential site of particle acceleration and neutrino production. Recently, IceCube reported evidence of neutrino emission from the Seyfert II galaxy NGC 1068. The absence of a matching flux of TeV gamma rays suggests that neutrinos are produced where gamma rays can efficiently get attenuated, for example, in the hot coronal environment near the SMBH at the core of the AGN. Here, we select the intrinsically brightest (in X-ray) Seyfert galaxies in the Southern Sky from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) and search for associated neutrinos using starting track events in IceCube. In addition to the standard power law flux assumption, we leverage a dedicated disc-corona model of neutrino production in such an environment to improve the discovery potential of the search. In this contribution, we report on the expected performance of our searches for neutrinos from these Seyfert galaxies.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are powerful astronomical objects with very high luminosities. Theoretical arguments suggest that these objects are capable of accelerating particles to energies of 10$^{20}$ eV. In environments with matter or photon targets, cosmic-ray interactions transpire leading to the production of pionic gamma rays and neutrinos. Since the AGN environment is rich in gas, dust and photons, they are promising candidate sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. While the neutrinos manage to escape, the gamma rays may further interact and cascade down to hard X-rays in environments with sufficiently large photon or gas targets. We have used 12 years of IceCube data to perform a stacked search and a point source search for high-energy neutrino emission from hard X-ray AGN sampled from $\textit{Swift}$-BAT Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) and present the results of these two analyses.

  We present the results of our ALMA $\lesssim$0.5 kpc-resolution dense molecular line (HCN and HCO$^{+}$ J=2-1, J=3-2, and J=4-3) observations of 12 nearby (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies ([U]LIRGs). After matching beam sizes of all molecular line data to the same values in all (U)LIRGs, we derive molecular line flux ratios, by extracting spectra in the central 0.5, 1, 2 kpc circular regions, and 0.5-1 and 1-2 kpc annular regions. Based on non-LTE model calculations, we quantitatively confirm that the innermost ($\lesssim$0.5 kpc) molecular gas is very dense ($\gtrsim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and warm ($\gtrsim$300 K) in ULIRGs, and that in one LIRG is also modestly dense (10$^{4-5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and warm ($\sim$100 K). We then investigate the spatial variation of the HCN-to-HCO$^{+}$ flux ratios and high-J to low-J flux ratios of HCN and HCO$^{+}$. A subtle sign of decreasing trend of these ratios from the innermost ($\lesssim$0.5 kpc) to outer nuclear (0.5-2 kpc) region is discernible in a significant fraction of the observed ULIRGs. For two AGN-hosting ULIRGs which display the trend most clearly, we find based on a Bayesian approach that the HCN-to-HCO$^{+}$ abundance ratio and gas kinetic temperature systematically increase from the outer nuclear to the innermost region. We suggest that this trend comes from potential AGN effects, because no such spatial variation is found in a starburst-dominated LIRG.

  We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral-field spectroscopy of the nearby luminous infrared galaxy, NGC 7469. We take advantage of the high spatial/spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of JWST /NIRSpec to study the 3.3 um neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) grain emission on ~60 pc scales. We find a clear change in the average grain properties between the star-forming ring and the central AGN. Regions in the vicinity of the AGN, with [NeIII]/[NeII]&gt;0.25, tend to have larger grain sizes and lower aliphatic-to-aromatic (3.4/3.3) ratios indicating that smaller grains are preferentially removed by photo-destruction in the vicinity of the AGN. We find an overall suppression of the total PAH emission relative to the ionized gas in the central 1 kpc region of the AGN in NGC 7469 compared to what has been observed with Spitzer on 3 kpc scales. However, the fractional 3.3 um to total PAH power is enhanced in the starburst ring, possibly due to a variety of physical effects on sub-kpc scales, including recurrent fluorescence of small grains or multiple photon absorption by large grains. Finally, the IFU data show that while the 3.3 um PAH-derived star formation rate (SFR) in the ring is 8% higher than that inferred from the [NeII] and [NeIII] emission lines, the integrated SFR derived from the 3.3 um feature would be underestimated by a factor of two due to the deficit of PAHs around the AGN, as might occur if a composite system like NGC 7469 were to be observed at high-redshift.

  We study the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of the prototypical low-mass active galactic nucleus (AGN) in NGC 4395. We jointly model the optical through mid-infrared SED with a combination of galaxy and AGN light, and find that on arcsecond scales, the AGN dominates at most wavelengths. However, there is still some ambiguity about emission from the galaxy, owing partially to the strong short-term variability of the black hole. We investigate the use of smooth and clumpy-torus models in order to disentangle the nuclear infrared emission, as well as exploring the use of poloidal wind emission to account for the blue spectral slope observed in the near-IR. Even when simultaneously fitting the full optical-IR spectral range, we find that degeneracies still remain in the best-fit models. We conclude that high spatial resolution and wider wavelength coverage with the James Webb Space Telescope is needed to understand the mid-infrared emission in this complex highly-variable object, which is the best nearby example to provide a blueprint to finding other low-mass AGN via their mid-infrared emission in the future.
