  In this work, we studied the broadband temporal and spectral properties of the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) Ton 599 and explored the one-zone leptonic model to fit the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). We collected the long-term data from June 2020 to August 2024 when the source was in a long flaring episode. We used the Bayesian block methodology to identify the various flux states which included three flares. The broadband fractional variability is estimated during two flaring states and in the total light curve. The Fvar distribution with respect to frequency shows a double hump structure similar to broadband SED. The Power spectral density (PSD) shows a pink-noise kind of stochastic variability in the light curve and we do not see any break in the power spectrum suggesting a much longer characteristic time scale is involved in gamma-ray variability. The flux distribution is well-fitted with a double log-normal flux distribution suggesting the variability of non-linear in nature. The gamma-ray, optical, and X-ray emissions were found to be highly correlated with a zero time lag suggesting a co-spatial origin. We used the one-zone leptonic model to reproduce the broad-band spectrum in the energy range from IR to very high-energy gamma-ray. The increase in the magnetic field and the Doppler factor were found to be the main cause for high flux states. The XMM-Newton spectra taken during one of the flaring durations exhibit a signature of black body emission from the accretion disk suggesting a possible disk-jet coupling. This has also been indicated by the gamma-ray flux distribution which shows the distribution as non-linear in nature mostly seen in galactic X-ray binaries or AGN where emission is dominated by the accretion disk. This possibility of disk-jet coupling will be explored in the coming works.

  Utilizing a range of techniques including multi-band light curves, softness ratio analysis, structure functions, rms spectra, cross-correlation functions, and ratios of spectra from different intervals, we present a comprehensive study of the complex X-ray spectral variability in Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 120, through re-analyzing its six XMM-Newton observations taken between 2003 and 2014. We find a clear ''softer-when-brighter" trend in the 2--10 keV power-law component over long timescales, with this trend being timescale dependent, as it is much weaker on shorter timescales, similar to that previously detected in NGC 4051. Notably, a rare ''harder-when-brighter" trend is observed during one exposure, indicating dynamic changes in the spectral variability behavior of the power-law component. This exceptional exposure, with the spectral variability indeed marked by a power-law pivoting at an unusually low energy of ~ 2 keV, suggests intricate variations in the thermal Comptonization processes within the corona. Furthermore, when the data below 2 keV are included, we identify that the soft excess component adds significant complexity to the spectral variability, such as evidenced by a transition from ''harder-when-brighter'' to ''softer-when-brighter'' during another single exposure. Such extra complexity arises because the variability of the soft excess sometimes follows and sometimes does not follow the changes in the power-law component. Our findings underscore the necessity of applying multiple analytic techniques to fully capture the multifaceted spectral variability of AGNs.

  Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei (CLAGN) are characterised by extreme variations in line emission over short timescales, mostly affecting broad H$\beta$ lines. While a few hundred CLAGN are known, a complete sample of turn-on CLAGN is still elusive. Here, we present a search for turn-on CLAGN in a complete sample of galaxies, using archival spectra and recent light curves. We obtained light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) for 16,232 emission line galaxies, including both star-forming and active galaxies, at $z&lt;0.1$ with spectra from the Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS). We first establish typical variability behaviour for different AGN types, as recorded between 2001 and 2009, and then select outliers from the bulk behaviour as CLAGN candidates. We obtain new spectra for the candidates and identify 12 new turn-on CLAGN (appearing broad H$\beta$ line) and 19 new turn-off CLAGN (disappearing broad H$\beta$ line). We may have missed AGN that changed and reverted their state over the 15$-$20 years since 6dFGS spectra were taken, and thus our CLAGN rates of 1.7$\%$ for turn-on and 9.6$\%$ for turn-off are lower limits. The turn-on rate is naturally much lower as the type 1.9/2 sample is dominated by obscured AGN due to orientation, which are not expected to change. However, the number of turn-on (27) and turn-off (24) CLAGN we find are similar, suggesting that our parent AGN sample is reasonably complete in our search volume at $z&lt;0.1$.

  The physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) reflect signatures of the underlying gravitational potential, mergers and strong interactions with other halos and satellite galaxies, as well as galactic feedback from supernovae and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Traditionally, clusters have been characterized in terms of summary statistics, such as halo mass, X-ray luminosity, cool-core state, luminosity of AGN, and number of merging components. In this paper of the Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning series (ERGO-ML), we instead consider the full information content available in maps of X-ray emission from the ICM. We employ Nearest Neighbour Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) to identify and populate a low-dimensional representation space of such images. Using idealized X-ray maps of the 352 clusters of the TNG-Cluster cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation suite, we take three orthogonal projections of each cluster at eight snapshots within the redshift range $0\leq z&lt;1$, resulting in a dataset of $\sim$8,000 images. Our findings reveal that this representation space forms a continuous distribution from relaxed to merging objects, and from centrally-peaked to flat emission profiles. The representation also exhibits clear trends with redshift, with halo, gas, stellar, and SMBH mass, with time since a last major merger, and with indicators of dynamical state. We show that an 8-dimensional representation can be used to predict a variety of cluster properties, find analogs, and identify correlations between physical properties, thereby suggesting causal relationships. Our analysis demonstrates that contrastive learning is a powerful tool for characterizing galaxy clusters from their images alone, allowing us to derive constraints on their physical properties and formation histories using cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations.

  Active galactic nucleus (AGN) growth in disk-dominated, merger-free galaxies is poorly understood, largely due to the difficulty in disentangling the AGN emission from that of the host galaxy. By carefully separating this emission, we examine the differences between AGNs in galaxies hosting a (possibly) merger-grown, classical bulge, and AGNs in secularly grown, truly bulgeless disk galaxies. We use GALFIT to obtain robust, accurate morphologies of 100 disk-dominated galaxies imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope. Adopting an inclusive definition of classical bulges, we detect a classical bulge component in $53.3 \pm 0.5$ per cent of the galaxies. These bulges were not visible in Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry, however these galaxies are still unambiguously disk-dominated, with an average bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of $0.1 \pm 0.1$. We find some correlation between bulge mass and black hole mass for disk-dominated galaxies, though this correlation is significantly weaker in comparison to the relation for bulge-dominated or elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, a significant fraction ($\gtrsim 90$ per cent) of our black holes are overly massive when compared to the relationship for elliptical galaxies. We find a weak correlation between total stellar mass and black hole mass for the disk-dominated galaxies, hinting that the stochasticity of black hole-galaxy co-evolution may be higher disk-dominated than bulge-dominated systems.
