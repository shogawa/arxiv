  Studying how the black hole (BH) - (galaxy) bulge mass relation evolves with redshift provides valuable insights into the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. However, obtaining accurate measurement of BH masses is challenging due to the bias towards the most massive and luminous galaxies. We use an analytical astrophysical model with galaxy stellar mass function, pair fraction, merger timescale and BH-bulge mass relation extended to include redshift evolution. The model can predict the intensity of the gravitational wave background produced by a population of supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) as a function of the frequency. We focus on the BH-bulge mass relation and its variation with redshift using the EAGLE, Illustris, TNG100, TNG300, Horizon-AGN and SIMBA large-scale cosmological simulations. By understanding the processes and relationships concerning the formation and co-evolution of galaxies and their central BHs we can make theoretical and analytical expressions in order to refine current astrophysical models. This allows us to compare the predictions of this model with the constraints of Pulsar Timing Array observations. Here, we employ Bayesian analysis for the parameter inference. By fitting the BH-bulge mass parameters to the Illustris and SIMBA simulations we analyze the changes in the constraints on the other astrophysical parameters. Furthermore, we also examine the variation in SMBHB merger rate with mass and redshift between these large-scale simulations.

  The history of reionisation is highly dependent on the ionising properties of high-redshift galaxies. It is therefore important to have a solid understanding of how the ionising properties of galaxies are linked to physical and observable quantities. In this paper, we use the First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) to study the Lyman-continuum (LyC, i.e. hydrogen-ionising) emission of massive ($M_*&gt;10^8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) galaxies at redshifts $z=5-10$. We find that the specific ionising emissivity (i.e. intrinsic ionising emissivity per unit stellar mass) decreases as stellar mass increases, due to the combined effects of increasing age and metallicity. FLARES predicts a median ionising photon production efficiency (i.e. intrinsic ionising emissivity per unit intrinsic far-UV luminosity) of $\log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion}\rm{/erg^{-1}Hz})=25.40^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$, with values spanning the range $\log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion}\rm{/erg^{-1}Hz})=25-25.75$. This is within the range of many observational estimates, but below some of the extremes observed. We compare the production efficiency with observable properties, and find a weak negative correlation with the UV-continuum slope, and a positive correlation with the OIII equivalent width. We also consider the dust-attenuated production efficiency (i.e. intrinsic ionising emissivity per unit dust-attenuated far-UV luminosity), and find a median of $\log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion}\rm{/erg^{-1}Hz})\sim25.5$. Within our sample of $M_*&gt;10^8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ galaxies, it is the stellar populations in low mass galaxies that contribute the most to the total ionising emissivity. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) emission accounts for $10-20$ % of the total emissivity at a given redshift, and extends the LyC luminosity function by $\sim0.5$ dex.

  Radio galaxies are a subclass of active galactic nuclei the supermassive black hole releases energy into the environment via relativistic jets. The jets are not constantly active throughout the life of the host galaxy and alternate between active and quiescent phases. Remnant radio galaxies are detected during a quiescent phase and define a class of unique sources to constrain the AGN duty cycle. We present, a spatially resolved radio analysis of the radio galaxy associated with NGC 6086 and constraints on the spectral age of the diffuse emission to investigate the duty cycle and evolution of the source. We use three new low-frequency, high-sensitivity observations, performed with the Low Frequency Array at 144 MHz and with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 400 MHz and 675 MHz. To these, we add two Very Large Array archival observations at 1400 and 4700 MHz. In the new observations, we detect a second pair of larger lobes and three regions with a filamentary morphology. We analyse the spectral index trend in the inner remnant lobes and see systematic steeper values at the lower frequencies compared to the GHz ones. Steeper spectral indices are found in the newly detected outer lobes (up to 2.1), as expected if they trace a previous phase of activity of the AGN. However, the differences between the spectra suggest different dynamical evolution within the intragroup medium during their expansion and/or different magnetic field values. We place constraints on the age of the inner and outer lobes and derive the duty cycle of the source. This results in a total active time of $\sim$39%. The filamentary structures have a steep spectral index ($\sim$1) without any spectral index trend and only one of them shows a steepening in the spectrum. Their origin is not yet clear, but they may have formed due to the compression of the plasma or due to magnetic field substructures.   

Interpretation of IR variability of AGNs in the hollow bi-conical dust

  We show that, contrary to simple predictions, most AGNs show at best only a small increase of lags with increasing wavelength in the J, H, K, and L bands . We suggest that a possible cause of this near simultaneity of the variability from the near-IR to the mid-IR is that the hot dust is in a hollow bi-conical outflow of which we preferentially see the near side. In the proposed model sublimation or re-creation of dust (with some delay relative luminosity variations) along our line of sight in the hollow cone could be a factor in explaining the changing look phenomenon of AGNs. Variations in the dust obscuration can help explain changes in relationship of H-beta time delay on Luv variability. The relative wavelength independence of IR lags simplifies the use of IR lags for estimating cosmological parameters.

  The fundamental celestial reference frame (CRF) is based on two catalogs of astrometric positions, the third realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3), and the much larger Gaia~CRF, built from the third data release (DR3). The objects in common between these two catalogs are mostly distant AGNs and quasars that are both sufficiently optically bright for Gaia and radio-loud for the VLBI. This limited collection of reference objects is crucially important for the mutual alignment of the two CRFs and maintenance of all the other frames and coordinate systems branching from the ICRF. In this paper, we show that the three components of ICRF3 (S/X, K, and X/Ka band catalogs) have significantly different sky-correlated vector fields of position offsets with respect to Gaia~DR3. When iteratively expanded in the vector spherical harmonics up to degree 4 on a carefully vetted set of common sources, each of these components includes several statistically significant terms. The median sky-correlated offsets from the Gaia positions are found to be 56 $\mu$as for the S/X, 100 $\mu$as for the K, and 324 $\mu$as for the Ka catalogs. The weighted mean vector field is subtracted from the Gaia reference positions, while the deviations from that field are added to each of the ICRF3 components. The corrected positions from each of the four input catalogs are combined into a single weighted mean catalog, which we propose to be the current most accurate realization of an inertial radio-optical CRF.

  As one of the drivers of feedback in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the jets launched from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are important for understanding the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. However, the formation of AGN jets is far from clear. The discovery of $\gamma$-ray narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies during the past two decades has provided us with a new means of studying the link between jets and accretion processes and the formation of jets. Here, we explore the coupling of jet and accretion discs in seven bright $\gamma$-ray NLS1 galaxies by studying simultaneous optical/ultraviolet and X-ray observations of these systems taken by Swift. The results show that, except for 1H 0323+342 in which the X-rays are significantly contributed from the accretion disc, the observed X-ray emission of the other sources is dominated by the jet, and accretion process makes little contribution if not absent. Although the origin of the X-ray emission is different, the broad-band spectral shape characterized by $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ and the X-ray flux is found to follow the same evolutionary trend in 1H 0323+342, PMN J0948+0022, and PKS 1502+036. For the remaining sources, the trend is not observed or the sampling is not dense enough.
