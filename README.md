  We present a comprehensive examination of the three most recent versions of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic galaxy formation model, focusing on the evolution of galaxy properties across a broad stellar mass range ($10^7\:{\rm M}_{\odot}\lesssim{M_\star}\lesssim10^{12}\:{\rm M}_{\odot}$) from $z=0$ to $z\simeq10$. We compare the predictions with the latest multiband data from key astronomical surveys, including SDSS, CANDELS, and COSMOS along with HST, JWST, and ALMA. We assess the models' ability to reproduce various time-dependent galaxy scaling relations for star-forming and quenched galaxies. Key focus areas include global galaxy properties such as stellar mass functions, cosmic star formation rate density, and the evolution of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Additionally, we examine resolved morphological properties such as the galaxy mass-size relation, alongside core $(R&lt;1\,{\rm{kpc}})$ and effective $(R&lt;R_{\rm{e}})$ stellar-mass surface densities as a function of stellar mass. This analysis reveals that the \textsc{L-Galaxies} models are in qualitatively good agreement with observed global galaxy scaling relations up to $z\simeq10$. However, significant discrepancies exist at both low and high redshifts in accurately reproducing the number density, size, and surface density evolution of quenched galaxies. These issues are most pronounced for massive galaxies, where the simulations underpredict the abundance of quenched galaxies at $z\geq1.5$, reaching a discrepancy of a factor of 60 by $z\approx3$, with sizes several times larger than observed. Therefore, we propose that the physical prescriptions governing the cessation of star formation in galaxies, such as AGN feedback and processes related to merging, require improvement to be better supported by observational data.

  Detecting active black holes in dwarf galaxies has proven to be a challenge due to their small size and weak electromagnetic signatures. Mid-infrared variability has emerged as a promising tool that can be used to detect active low-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies. We analyzed 10.4 years of photometry from the ALL$WISE$/NEO$WISE$ multi-epoch catalogs, identifying 25 objects with AGN-like variability. Independent confirmation of AGN activity was found in 68% of these objects using optical and near-infrared diagnostics. Notably, we discovered a near-infrared coronal line [S IX] $\lambda$ 1.252 $\mu$m in J1205, the galaxy with the lowest stellar mass (log M$_{*}$ = 7.5 M$_{\odot}$) and low metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 7.46) in our sample. Additionally, we found broad Pa$\alpha$ potentially from the BLR in two targets, and their implied black hole masses are consistent with black hole-stellar mass relations. Comparing non-variable galaxies with similar stellar masses and $WISE$ $W1-W2$ colors, we found no clear trends between variability and large-scale galaxy properties. However, we found that AGN activity likely causes redder $W1-W2$ colors in variable targets, while for the non-variable galaxies, the contribution stems from strong star formation activity. A high incidence of optical broad lines was also observed in variable targets. Our results suggest that mid-infrared variability is an effective method for detecting AGN activity in low-mass galaxies and can help uncover a larger sample of active low-mass ($&lt;$ 10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$) black holes in the universe.

  We present the identification of changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument First Data Release and Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 at z \leq 0.9. To confirm the CL-AGNs, we utilize spectral flux calibration assessment via an [O\,{\sc iii}]-based calibration, pseudo-photometry examination, and visual inspection. This rigorous selection process allows us to compile a statistical catalog of 561 CL-AGNs, encompassing 527 $\rm H\beta$, 149$\rm H\alpha$, and 129 Mg II CL behaviors. In this sample, we find 1) a 283:278 ratio of turn-on to turn-off CL-AGNs. 2) the critical value for CL events is confirmed around Eddington ratio \sim 0.01. 3) a strong correlation between the change in the luminosity of the broad emission lines (BEL) and variation in the continuum luminosity, with Mg II and $\rm H\beta$ displaying similar responses during CL phases. 4) the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram for CL-AGNs shows no statistically difference from the general AGN catalog. 5) five CL-AGNs are associated with asymmetrical mid-infrared flares, possibly linked to tidal disruption events. Given the large CL-AGNs and the stochastic sampling of spectra, we propose that some CL events are inherently due to typical AGN variability during low accretion rates, particularly for CL events of the singular BEL. Finally, we introduce a Peculiar CL phase, characterized by a gradual decline over decades in the light curve and the complete disappearance of entire BEL in faint spectra, indicative of a real transition in the accretion disk.   

Do all the quasars and high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) in the
  3CRR catalog contain a magnetically arrested disk (MAD)?

  Based on the magnetization, an accretion disk with large-scale magnetic field can be separated into either standard and normal evolution (SANE) or magnetically arrested disk (MAD), which are difficult to identify from observations. It is still unclear whether all the radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) with a thin disk and strong radio emissions contain a MAD. We investigate this issue by utilizing the 3CRR catalog. We compile a sample of 35 quasars and 14 high-excitation radio galaxies powered by a thin accretion disk. In order to consistently compare with the MAD sample given by Li et al. (2022), the optical-UV emissions of our sample are all detected by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It is found that the average X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$) of our sample is about 5.0 times higher than that of radio-quiet AGNs (RQAGNs) with matching optical-UV luminosity ($L_{\rm UV}$), in general accord with the factor of 4.5 times in MAD sample within the uncertainty. The relationship between radio (5~GHz) and X-ray (2 keV) luminosities in the 3CRR sources is also found to be consistent with the MAD sample. Furthermore, the jet efficiencies of 3CRR sources are consistent with those from the GRMHD simulations of MAD. Therefore, we suggest that probably all the quasars and at least a fraction of high-excitation radio galaxies in the 3CRR catalog, and perhaps all the RLAGNs with strong radio emissions contain a MAD.

  Outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are seen in numerous compact sources; however, it has remained unclear how to distinguish between the driving mechanisms, such as winds and jets. Therefore, our study aims to offer observational insights from simulations to aid in this distinction. Specifically, in this paper, we investigate the evolution of wide-angled, moderately relativistic, magnetized winds and analyze their non-thermal radio emission and polarization properties. We find that the evolution of winds varies depending on factors such as power, density, and opening angle, which in turn influence their observable characteristics. Additionally, different viewing angles can lead to varying observations. Furthermore, we note distinctions in the evolution of winds compared to jets, resulting in disparities in their observable features. Jets typically exhibit a thin spine and hotspot(s). Winds manifest broader spines or an "hourglass-shaped" bright emission in the cocoon, which are capped by bright arcs. Both display high polarization coinciding with the bright spine and hotspots/arcs, although these regions are relatively compact and localized in jets when compared to winds. We emphasize the importance of high resolution, as we demonstrate that emission features from both jets and winds can become indistinguishable at lower resolutions. The distribution of polarization is largely unaffected by resolution, though lower polarization becomes more noticeable when the resolution is decreased.

  The extremes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) variability offer valuable new insights into the drivers and physics of AGN. We discuss some of the most extreme cases of AGN variability; the highest amplitudes, deep minima states, extreme spectral states, Seyfert-type changes, and semi-periodic signals, including new X-ray observations. The properties of changing-look (CL) AGN are briefly reviewed and a classification scheme is proposed which encompasses the variety of CL phenomena; distinguishing slow and fast events, repeat events, and frozen-look AGN which do not show any emission-line response. Long-term light curves that are densely covered over multiple years, along with follow-up spectroscopy, are utilized to gain insight into the underlying variability mechanisms including accretion disk and broad-line region physics. Remarkable differences are seen, for instance, in the optical spectral response to extreme outbursts, implying distinct intrinsic variability mechanisms. Furthermore, we discuss methods for distinguishing between CL AGN and CL look-alike events (tidal disruption events or supernovae in dense media). Finally, semi-periodic light curve variability is addressed and the latest multiwavelength (MWL) light curve of the binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidate OJ 287 from the MOMO project is presented. Recent results from that project have clearly established the need for new binary SMBH modelling matching the tight new constraints from observations, including the measurement of a low (primary) SMBH mass of ~10^8 Msun which also implies that OJ 287 is no longer in the regime of near-future pulsar timing arrays.

  Mass estimates of black holes (BHs) in the centers of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) often rely on the radius-luminosity relation. However, this relation, usually probed by reverberation mapping (RM), is poorly constrained in the high-luminosity and high-redshift ends due to the very long expected lag times. Multiply imaged AGN may thus offer a unique opportunity to explore the radius-luminosity relation at these ends. In addition to comprising several magnified images which enable a more efficient light-curve sampling, the time delay between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars can also aid in making such RM measurements feasible on reasonable timescales: If the time delay is, for example, of the order of the expected time lag, changes in the emission lines in the leading image can be observed around the same time as the changes in the continuum in the trailing image. In this work we probe the typical time-delay distribution in galaxy-cluster lenses and estimate the number of both high-mass ($\sim10^9-10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), and high-redshift ($z\gtrsim4-12$) quasars that are expected to be strongly lensed by clusters. We find that less than one, very massive (and luminous, L$_{UV}&gt;10^{46.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$) multiply imaged quasar is expected across the sky down to 30 AB mag. Nonetheless, up to several dozen thousand M$_{BH}\sim10^{6}$-$10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ broad-line AGN at $z&gt;4$ should be multiply imaged by galaxy clusters and detectable with JWST, hundreds with $\textit{Euclid}$ and several thousands with the $\textit{Roman}$ Space Telescope, across the whole sky. These could supply an important calibration for the BH mass scaling in the early Universe.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a ubiquitous population of dust-obscured compact sources at $z\gtrsim 4$. Many of these objects exhibit signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, making their study crucial for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their growth with host galaxies. In this work, we examine low and medium resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the JADES GTO public data release in the GOODS-N field of a red, luminous ($M_{\rm B}\sim-22.2$ mag) and compact ($&lt;500$ pc) source at $z=4.13$. The rest-optical ($\lambda_{\rm rest} &gt; 4000$ A) continuum of this source is strongly dominated by a massive (log$_{10}$[$M_*/M_\odot] \sim 10.6$), quenched (log$_{10}$[sSFR/yr$^{-1}$] $&lt; -11$) galaxy, as indicated by the clear presence of a Balmer break and stellar absorption lines. Star-formation history modeling reveals a starburst episode followed by rapid quenching about 200 Myr ago. The spectrum shows extremely broad (FWHM $\sim 2500$ km/s) H$\alpha$ emission and elevated optical line ratios, indicating an actively accreting SMBH. Moreover, our work has potentially revealed clear AGN signatures in the rest-UV in LRDs for the first time, via a detection of a strong Ly$\alpha$ emission and a broad MgII, doublet. The derived black hole mass of log$_{10}$($M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) \sim 7.3$ results in $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\sim 0.04$ %, consistent with the local relations, unlike the elevated ratios in other high-$z$ reddened AGN. Finally, we use JWST data from AGN at $z=4-10$ to explore an evolutionary link between high-$z$ reddened AGN, early quiescent galaxies, and local ellipticals.
