  We report the discovery of a large-scale structure at z=3.44 revealed by JWST data in the EGS field. This structure, dubbed "Cosmic Vine", consists of 20 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts at 3.43&lt;z&lt;3.45 and six galaxy overdensities with consistent photometric redshifts, making up a vine-like structure extending over a ~4x0.2 pMpc^2 area. The two most massive galaxies (M*~10^10.9 Msun) of the Cosmic Vine are found to be quiescent with bulge-dominated morphologies (B/T&gt;70%). Comparisons with simulations suggest that the Cosmic Vine would form a cluster with halo mass &gt;10^14 Msun at z=0, and the two massive galaxies are likely forming the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). The results unambiguously reveal that massive quiescent galaxies can form in growing large-scale structures at z&gt;3, thus disfavoring the environmental quenching mechanisms that require a virialized cluster core. Instead, as suggested by the interacting and bulge-dominated morphologies, the two galaxies are likely quenched by merger-triggered starburst or AGN feedback before falling into a cluster core. Moreover, we found that the observed specific star formation rates of massive quiescent galaxies in z&gt;3 dense environments are two orders of magnitude lower than that of the BCGs in the TNG300 simulation. This discrepancy potentially poses a challenge to the models of massive cluster galaxy formation. Future studies comparing a large sample with dedicated cluster simulations are required to solve the problem.

  Since the discovery of the Cosmic X-ray Background, astronomers have strived to understand the accreting super massive black holes contributing to its peak in the 10-40 keV band. Existing soft X-ray telescopes could study this population up to only 10 keV, and, while NuSTAR (focusing on 3-24 keV) made great progress, it also left significant uncertainties in characterizing the hard X-ray population, crucial for calibrating current population synthesis models. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of simulations of two extragalactic surveys (deep and wide) with the High-Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P), each observed for 2 Megaseconds. Applying established source detection techniques, we show that HEX-P surveys will reach a flux of $\sim$10$^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the 10-40 keV band, an order of magnitude fainter than current NuSTAR surveys. With the large sample of new hard X-ray detected sources ($\sim2000$), we showcase HEX-P's ability to resolve more than 80% of the Cosmic X-ray Background up to 40 keV into individual sources. The uncertainties expected on HEX-P's resolved background measurement will allow us to distinguish between population synthesis models of SMBH growth. HEX-P leverages accurate broadband (0.5-40 keV) spectral analysis and the combination of soft and hard X-ray colors to provide obscuration constraints even for the fainter sources, with the overall objective of measuring the Compton-Thick fraction. With unprecedented sensitivity in the 10-40 keV band, HEX-P explores the hard X-ray emission from AGN to flux limits never reached before, thus expanding the parameter space for serendipitous discoveries. Consequently, it is plausible that new models will be needed to capture the population HEX-P will unveil.

  Both observational evidence and theoretical considerations from MHD simulations of jets suggest that the relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are radially stratified, with a fast inner spine surrounded by a slower-moving outer sheath. The resulting relativistic shear layers are a prime candidate for the site of relativistic particle acceleration in the jets of AGN and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this article, we present outcomes of particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic-field generation and particle acceleration in the relativistic shear boundary layers (SBLs) of jets in AGN and GRBs. We investigate the effects of inverse Compton cooling on relativistic particles that are accelerated in the SBLs of relativistic jets including the self-consistent calculation of the radiation spectrum produced by inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons in an isotropic external soft photon field. We find that the Compton cooling can be substantial, depending on the characteristic energy (blackbody temperature and energy density) of the external radiation field. The produced Compton emission is highly anisotropic and more strongly beamed along the jet direction than the characteristic $1/\Gamma$ pattern expected from intrinsically isotropic emission in the comoving frame of an emission region moving along the jet with bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$. We suggest that this may resolve the long-standing problem of the Doppler Factor Crisis.

  Constraining the primary growth channel of supermassive black holes (SMBH) remains one the most actively debated questions in the context of cosmological structure formation. Owing to the expected connection between SMBH spin parameter evolution and the accretion and merger history of individual black holes, population spin measurements offer a rare observational window into the SMBH cosmic growth. As of today, the most common method for estimating SMBH spin relies on modeling the relativistically broaden atomic profiles in the reflection spectrum observed in X-rays. In this paper, we study the observational requirements needed to confidently distinguish between the primary SMBH growth channels, based on their distinct spin-mass distributions predicted by the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation. In doing so, we characterize outstanding limitations associated with the existing measurements and discuss the landscape of future observational campaigns, which can be planned and executed with future X-ray observatories. We focus our attention on the High-Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P), a concept probe-class mission aimed to serve the high-energy community in the 2030s.

  The hard X-ray emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and black hole X-ray binaries is thought to be produced by a hot cloud of electrons referred to as the corona. This emission, commonly described by a power law with a high-energy cutoff, is suggestive of Comptonization by thermal electrons. While several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin, geometry, and composition of the corona, we still lack a clear understanding of this fundamental component. NuSTAR has been playing a key role improving our knowledge of X-ray coronae thanks to its unprecedented sensitivity above 10 keV. However, these constraints are limited to bright, nearby sources. The High Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P) is a probe-class mission concept combining high spatial resolution X-ray imaging and broad spectral coverage (0.2-80 keV) with a sensitivity superior to current facilities. In this paper, we highlight the major role that HEX-P will play in further advancing our insights of X-ray coronae, notably in AGN. We demonstrate how HEX-P will measure key properties and track the temporal evolution of coronae in unobscured AGN. This will allow us to determine their electron distribution and test the dominant emission mechanisms. Furthermore, we show how HEX-P will accurately estimate the coronal properties of obscured AGN in the local Universe, helping address fundamental questions about AGN unification. In addition, HEX-P will characterize coronae in a large sample of luminous quasars at cosmological redshifts for the first time and track the evolution of coronae in transient systems in real time. We also demonstrate how HEX-P will enable estimating the coronal geometry using spectral-timing techniques. HEX-P will thus be essential to understand the evolution and growth of black holes over a broad range of mass, distance, and luminosity, and will help uncover the black holes' role in shaping the Universe.   

The Survival and Entrainment of Molecules and Dust in Galactic Winds

  Recent years have seen excellent progress in modeling the entrainment of T $\sim$ $10^4$K atomic gas in galactic winds. However, the entrainment of cool, dusty T $\sim$ 10-100K molecular gas, which is also observed outflowing at high velocity, is much less understood. Such gas, which can be $10^5$ times denser than the hot wind, appears extremely difficult to entrain. We run 3D wind-tunnel simulations with photoionization self-shielding and evolve thermal dust sputtering and growth. Unlike almost all such simulations to date, we do not enforce any artificial temperature floor. We find efficient molecular gas formation and entrainment, as well as dust survival and growth through accretion. Key to this success is the formation of large amounts of 10^4K atomic gas via mixing, which acts as a protective "bubble wrap" and reduces the cloud overdensity to $\sim$ 100. This can be understood from the ratio of the mixing to cooling time. Before entrainment, when shear is large, t_mix/t_cool $\leq$ 1, and gas cannot cool below the "cooling bottleneck" at 5000K. Thus, the cloud survival criterion is identical to the well-studied purely atomic case. After entrainment, when shear falls, t_mix/t_cool &gt; 1, and the cloud becomes multi-phase, with comparable molecular and atomic masses. The broad temperature PDF, with abundant gas in the formally unstable 50 K &lt; T &lt; 5000 K range, agrees with previous ISM simulations with driven turbulence and radiative cooling. Our findings have implications for dusty molecular gas in stellar and AGN outflows, cluster filaments, "jellyfish" galaxies and AGB winds.
