It is widely expected that the obscured accretion stage can be the initial turning-on stage of active galactic nuclei from quiescent galaxies. We present mid-infrared light curves of NGC 6447 in 3.5$μ$m and 4.6 $μ$m bands observed by WISE/NEOWISE, which show an almost monotonic increasing trend of 1.2 mag over 14 years. The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of &gt;7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources. Based on the sample selection statistics, we estimate the duration of the episodes of AGN accretion (duty cycle) signified by the turning-on event as $10^4$-$10^6$ yr.

Galaxy clusters form through hierarchical assembly, where smaller substructures merge to build the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe. These mergers, combined with feedback from AGN, filamentary accretion, and other energy injection processes, generate turbulence and perturbations within the intra-cluster medium (ICM). X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations can be utilized to measure these ICM density and pressure inhomogeneities, in turn providing constraints on the effective Equation of State (EOS) of the perturbations and ICM velocities. In this work, we analyze deep SRG-eROSITA and Planck/SPT observations of Abell 3266 (A3266), a dynamically complex merging cluster with elongated morphology and significant substructure. We measure pressure and density fluctuations, and compute the power spectra and deprojected 3D amplitudes of these perturbations. We estimate the ratio of pressure-to-density fluctuation amplitudes as $1.00 \pm 0.55$ and non-thermal pressure support $0.068 \pm 0.050$. Density fluctuations are found to be stronger in the northern sector of the cluster compared to the south, consistent with ongoing accretion along a filamentary structure revealed by eROSITA. Further, we find the amplitude of density fluctuations increases with radius, qualitatively consistent with the trend found in cosmological simulations. Uncertainties in our results are dominated by the relatively low sensitivity of current Planck/SPT data, suggesting that improvements in SZ data quality could substantially improve our understanding of ICM energy injection, transport, and dissipation from this technique.

Star formation in galaxies is governed by internal and environmental processes, yet their relative roles are not well understood. In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z &lt; 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos.

Historically, the study of the central regions of Type 1 AGN has been limited by the combination of the host galaxy spectrum with strong emission from the accretion disk and NLR/BLR, which prevented us from accurately probing the galactic and AGN properties in the central regions. Integral field spectroscopy allows us to correct for this effect and study both the unobscured cores of AGN host galaxies as well as the uncontaminated spectra of their central engines with unprecedented precision. Using MUSE WFM observations, in this work, we present a combined method for modelling and subtracting QSO light in type-1 AGN alongside results for one such source, PKS 2153-68 (z=0.028), both jetted and gamma-ray emitting. After separating the host galaxy and AGN spectra, we discuss the discovery of an unresolved and yet-to-be-identified high-velocity ($\sim$25000 km/s) short timescale ($\leq$1 yr) variable emission, unlike anything observed in other variable AGN.

The existence of massive, compact galaxies (Little Red Dots, LRDs) at $z \sim 2$ challenges early structure formation models, suggesting rapid stellar and black hole (BH) assembly. While LRDs are efficient environments for BH growth, many show no X-ray evidence of strong AGN emission. We utilize a subsample of X-ray non-detected LRDs to test the compatibility of collision-based BH formation scenarios and constrain physical parameters like metallicity and column density. Our results indicate LRDs are ideal birthplaces for massive BHs, particularly given a mass-radius relation $R_{gal} \propto M_{gal}^{0.6}$. Collision-based models suggest seed masses larger than those in the local Universe, consistent with high-redshift BH mass-radius relations. We modeled BH seed formation and X-ray emission (0.3-7 keV) against observed upper limits. We find that mass-radius exponents $&gt; 0.55$ favor the collision-based scenario; however, consistency with stacked X-ray analysis requires specific accretion and obscuration parameters. Constant or increasing SFR scenarios with high Eddington ratios are feasible but necessitate larger column densities or higher metal enrichment. Alternatively, moderate sub-Eddington accretion reconciles massive seeds with observed masses and X-ray weakness. We conclude that even if LRDs began as starbursts, they should eventually evolve into AGNs.

Fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represent one of the most exotic astrophysical transients, exhibiting unusually strong emission across X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths. Their physical origins remain highly debated, with proposed explanations ranging from stellar explosion to tidal disruption event (TDE). Here we report observations of the most luminous FBOT, AT 2024wpp whose post-peak luminosity rebrightens in X ray and becomes flattening in optical in a manner follows the decay rate characteristic of TDEs ($L_{\rm bol} \propto t^{-5/3}$). This invokes energy contribution of accretion by a central compact object, getting further corroborations from hardening of X-ray spectral index and detection of outflow inferred from the emission lines at similar phase. Detailed modeling of luminsoity evolution favors a coalesce explosion of a 34 M$_{\odot}$ Wolf-Rayet star with a 15 M$_{\odot}$ black hole (BH), demonstrating that some FBOTs may be associated with TDE of a stellar blackhole.
