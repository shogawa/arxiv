  We study in detail the inner 600 pc of the Seyfert 2 galaxy ESO138-G001 by means of the SOAR Integral Field Spectrograph (SIFS) attached to the SOAR telescope. This source is known for displaying a very rich coronal line spectrum and a blob of high-excitation emission ~3" SE of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The nature of this emission has not been fully understood yet. The excellent spatial and spectral resolution of SIFS allows us to confirm that the bulk of the coronal line forest emission region is very compact, of ~0.8" in diameter, centred on the AGN and most likely powered by radiation from the AGN. In addition, evidence of a nuclear outflow, restricted to the inner 1" centred at the nucleus is found based on the detection of broad components in the most important emission lines. The gas in the inner few tens of parsecs filters out the AGN continuum so that the NLR is basically illuminated by a modified SED. This scenario is confirmed by means of photoionisation models that reproduce the most important lines detected in the SIFS field-of-view. From the modelling, we also found that the black hole mass M_BH of the AGN is about 10^5.5 solar mass, in agreement with previous X-ray observations. The spectrum of the SE blob is dominated by emission lines of low- to mid-ionisation, with no hints of coronal lines. Our results show that it represents gas in the ionisation cone that is photoionised by the filtered central AGN continuum.

  Weak gravitational lensing convergence peaks, the local maxima in weak lensing convergence maps, have been shown to contain valuable cosmological information complementary to commonly used two-point statistics. To exploit the full power of weak lensing for cosmology, we must model baryonic feedback processes because these reshape the matter distribution on non-linear and mildly non-linear scales. We study the impact of baryonic physics on the number density of weak lensing peaks using the FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suite. We generate ray-traced full-sky convergence maps mimicking the characteristics of a Stage IV weak lensing survey. We compare the number densities of peaks in simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the observed galaxy mass function and cluster gas fraction or to match a shifted version of these, and that use either thermally driven or jet AGN feedback. We show that the differences induced by realistic baryonic feedback prescriptions (typically $5-30$% for $\kappa = 0.1-0.4$) are smaller than those induced by reasonable variations in cosmological parameters ($20-60$% for $\kappa = 0.1-0.4$) but must be modeled carefully to obtain unbiased results. The reasons behind these differences can be understood by considering the impact of feedback on halo masses, or by considering the impact of different cosmological parameters on the halo mass function. Our analysis demonstrates that the baryonic suppression is insensitive to changes in cosmology up to $\kappa \approx 0.4$ and that the higher $\kappa$ regime is dominated by Poisson noise and cosmic variance.

  We investigate the fueling mechanisms of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by analyzing ten zoom-in cosmological simulations of massive galaxies, with stellar masses $10^{11-12} M_{\odot}$ and SMBH masses $10^{8.9-9.7}$ at $z=0$ and featuring various major and minor merger events. By tracing the gas history in these simulations, we categorize the gas accreted by the central SMBHs based on its origin. Gas that belonged to a different galaxy before accretion onto the BH is labeled as (1) ``external," while smoothly accreted cosmic gas is classified as (2) ``smooth." Gas produced within the primary halo through stellar evolution and subsequently accreted by the SMBH is classified as (3) ``recycled." Our analysis, which included stellar feedback, reveals that the primary fuel source for SMBHs is the recycled gas from dying stars. This recycled gas from stars in the inner region of the galaxy readily collapses toward the center, triggering starbursts, and simultaneously fueling the SMBH. Galaxy mergers also play a crucial role in fueling SMBHs in massive galaxies as SMBHs in massive halos tend to accrete a higher fraction of external gas from mergers compared to smoothly accreted gas. However, on average, it takes approximately 1.85 Gyr for external gas to enter the main galaxy and accrete onto the SMBH. Considering the presence of various other gas triggers for AGN activity alongside this time delay, the association between AGN and mergers may not always be obvious.

  Galaxy clusters are important probes for both cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We test the cosmological, hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulations by comparing to observations of the gaseous properties of clusters measured from X-ray observations. FLAMINGO contains unprecedented numbers of massive galaxy groups ($&gt;10^6$) and clusters ($&gt;10^5$) and includes variations in both cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We predict the evolution of cluster scaling relations as well as radial profiles of the temperature, density, pressure, entropy, and metallicity for different masses and redshifts. We show that the differences between volume-, and X-ray-weighting of particles in the simulations, and between cool-core non cool-core samples, are similar in size as the differences between simulations for which the stellar and AGN feedback has been calibrated to produce significantly different gas fractions. Compared to thermally-driven AGN feedback, kinetic jet feedback calibrated to produce the same gas fraction at $R_{\rm 500c}$ yields a hotter core with higher entropies and lower densities, which translates into a smaller fraction of cool-core clusters. Stronger feedback, calibrated to produce lower gas fractions and hence lower gas densities, results in higher temperatures, entropies, and metallicities, but lower pressures. The scaling relations and thermodynamic profiles show almost no evolution with respect to self-similar expectations, except for the metallicity decreasing with redshift. We find that the temperature, density, pressure, and entropy profiles of clusters in the fiducial FLAMINGO simulation are in excellent agreement with observations, while the metallicities in the core are too high.

  We present a thorough study of the Changing-Look Active Galactic Nucleus (CL-AGN) Mrk 1018, utilizing an extensive dataset spanning optical, UV, and X-ray spectro-photometric data from 2005 to 2019. We analysed X-ray spectra and broad-band photometry, and performed optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to comprehend the observed changing-look behaviour. We found that over the 14 years in analysis, significant changes in X-ray spectra occurred, as the hardness ratio increases by a factor of ~2. We validated also the broad-band dimming, with optical, UV, and X-ray luminosities decreasing by factors of &gt;7, &gt;24 and ~9, respectively. These dims are attributed to the declining UV emission. We described the X-ray spectra with a two-Comptonization model, revealing a consistent hot comptonizing medium but a cooling warm component. This cooling, linked to the weakening of the magnetic fields in the accretion disk, explains the UV dimming. We propose that the weakening is caused by the formation of a jet, in turn originated from the change of state of the inner accretion flow. Our optical-to-X-ray SED fitting supports this conclusion, as the normalised accretion rate is super-critical ($\mu=$0.06&gt;0.02) in the bright state and sub-critical ($\mu=$0.01&lt;0.02) in the faint state. Instabilities arising at the interface of the state-transition are able to reduce the viscous timescale to the observed ~10 years of Mrk 1018 variability. We explored a possible triggering mechanism for this state transition, involving gaseous clouds pushed onto the AGN sub-pc regions by a recent merging event or by cold chaotic accretion. This scenario, if validated by future simulations, could enhance our understanding of CL-AGN and raises questions about an accretion rate of ~0.02, coupled with minor disturbances in the accretion disk, being the primary factor in the changing-look phenomenon.
