  Over the past two decades, tight correlations between black hole masses ($M_\bullet$) and their host galaxy properties have been firmly established at low-$z$ ($z&lt;1$), indicating coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies. However, the situation at high-$z$, especially beyond cosmic noon ($z\gtrsim2.5$), is controversial. With a combination of \emph{JWST} NIRCam/wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) from FRESCO, CONGRESS and deep multi-band NIRCam/image data from JADES in the GOODS fields, we study the black hole to galaxy mass relation at z$\sim$1--4. After identifying 18 broad-line active galactic nuclei (BL AGNs) at $0.9&lt;z&lt;3.6$ (with 8 at $z&gt;2.5$) from the WFSS data, we measure their black hole masses based on broad near-infrared lines (Pa $\alpha$, Pa $\beta$, and He\,I $\lambda$10833\,\AA), and constrain their stellar masses ($M_{*}$) from AGN-galaxy image decomposition or SED decomposition. Taking account of the observational biases, the intrinsic scatter of the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation, and the errors in mass measurements, we find no significant difference in the $M_{\bullet}/M_{*}$ ratio for 2.5 $&lt; $ z $ &lt;$ 3.6 compared to that at lower redshifts ($1 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$), suggesting no evolution of the $M_{\bullet} - M_{*}$ relation up to z$\sim$4.

  Aims. We present MAMBO, a flexible and efficient workflow to build empirical galaxy and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) mock catalogues that reproduce the physical and observational properties of these sources.   Methods. We start from simulated dark matter (DM) haloes, to preserve the link with the cosmic web, and we populate them with galaxies and AGN using abundance matching techniques. We follow an empirical methodology, using stellar mass functions (SMF), host galaxy AGN mass functions and AGN accretion rate distribution functions studied at different redshifts to assign, among other properties, stellar masses, the fraction of quenched galaxies, or the AGN activity (demography, obscuration, multiwavelength emission, etc.).   Results. As a proof test, we apply the method to a Millennium DM lightcone of 3.14 $\rm deg^2$ up to redshift $z=10$ and down to stellar masses $\mathcal{M} \gtrsim 10^{7.5} \, M_\odot$. We show that the AGN population from the mock lightcone here presented reproduces with good accuracy various observables, such as state-of-the-art luminosity functions in the X-ray up to $z \sim 7$ and in the ultraviolet up to $z \sim 5$, optical/NIR colour-colour diagrams, and narrow emission line diagnostic diagrams. Finally, we demonstrate how this catalogue can be used to make useful predictions for large surveys. Using \textit{Euclid} as a case example, we compute, among other forecasts, the expected surface densities of galaxies and AGN detectable in the \textit{Euclid} $H_{\rm E}$ band. We find that \textit{Euclid} might observe (on $H_{\rm E}$ only) about $10^{7}$ and $8 \times 10^{7}$ Type 1 and 2 AGN respectively, and $2 \times 10^{9}$ galaxies at the end of its 14 679 $\rm deg^2$ Wide survey, in good agreement with other published forecasts.

  We explore the co-evolution of dark matter halos, their central galaxies, and central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using the IllustrisTNG (TNG) simulation. We find that the evolutionary histories of individual galaxies in the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ plane can be decomposed into four distinct phases, separated by three transition points. We identify the driving processes of galaxy evolution within each phase and derive the conditions necessary and sufficient for transitions to subsequent phases. The first phase is dominated by star formation, with its duration primarily determined by the mass of the SMBH seed and the surrounding gas environment. The second phase is characterized by rapid SMBH growth, and the transition to the next phase occurs when the thermal-mode feedback of active galactic nucleus (AGN) can unbind gas from the galaxy. The third phase involves self-regulation of the SMBH, and the transition to the quenched phase occurs when the kinetic-mode feedback of AGN counterbalances gas cooling within the subhalo. The final phase is dominated by mergers. We investigate the use of scaling relations among different mass components and evolutionary phases to understand processes implemented in TNG and other simulations, and discuss how current and forthcoming observations can be used to constrain models.

  The active galactic nucleus (AGN) feeding and feedback process in the centers of galaxy clusters and groups is still not well understood. NGC5044 is the ideal system in which to study AGN feedback. It hosts the largest known reservoir of cold gas in any cool-core galaxy group, and features several past epochs of AGN feedback imprinted as cavities in the X-ray bright intragroup medium (IGrM), as well as parsec scale jets. We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) high frequency observations of NGC5044 to assess the time variability of the mm-waveband emission from the accretion disk, and quantify the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) from the radio to sub-millimeter band. The SED is well described by advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and self-absorbed jet emission from an aging plasma with tau ~1kyr. We find a characteristic variability timescale of 150 days, which constrains the ADAF emission region to about 0.1pc, and the magnetic field to 4.7mG in the jets and and 870G in the accretion disk. A longer monitoring/sampling will allow to understand if the underlying process is truly periodic in nature.

  3C 264 is one of the few FRI radio galaxies with detected TeV emission. It is a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) and is generally associated with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Earlier multiwavelength studies suggest that the X-ray emission originates from a jet. However, the possibility that the RIAF can significantly contribute to the X-rays cannot be ruled out. In particular, hard X-ray emission $\gtrsim$10 keV has never been detected, making it challenging to distinguish between X-ray models. Here we report a NuSTAR detection up to 25 keV from 3C 264. We also present subpixel deconvolved Chandra images to resolve jet emission down to ~0.2 arcsec from the center of the unresolved X-ray core. Together with a simultaneous Swift observation, we have constrained the dominant hard X-ray emission to be from its unresolved X-ray core, presumably in its quiescent state. We found evidence of a cutoff in the energy around 20 keV, indicating that at least some of the X-rays from the core can be attributed to the RIAF. The Comptonization model suggests an electron temperature of about 15 keV and an optical depth ranging between 4 and 7, following the universality of coronal properties of black hole accretion. The cutoff energy or electron temperature of 3C 264 is the lowest among those of other LLAGNs. The detected hard X-ray emission is at least an order of magnitude higher than that predicted by synchrotron self-Compton models introduced to explain $\gamma$-ray and TeV emission, suggesting that the synchrotron electrons might be accelerated to higher energies than previously thought.
