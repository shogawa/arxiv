  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are intensely accreting supermassive black holes at the centers of massive galaxies. Though these objects occupy little spatial extent of the galaxy itself, they are thought to have far reaching affects, impacting the galaxy's star formation, and possibly it's lifespan until it becomes 'red and dead'. Typical galaxies demonstrate that, over cosmic time, they tend to separate into a bimodal distribution of 'red and dead' or blue and star forming. We examine whether active galaxies evolve over cosmic time in a similar way, and whether this can reveal anything about the complexities of the relationship between an AGN and the host galaxy. We use the Stripe82X survey to identify 3940 X-ray AGN spanning z=0-2.5, and we measure the rest-frame UVJ colors of each galaxy. We classify AGN as star-forming or quiescent based on their location in a UVJ color diagram. We find that there is not a clear bimodal distribution between AGN in star forming and quiescent galaxies. Furthermore, the most luminous X-ray sources tend to lie in the star forming region, which may indicate a correlation between central engine activity and increased rates of star formation.

  We present spaxel-by-spaxel stellar population fits for the $\sim$10 thousand MaNGA datacubes. We provide multiple extension fits files, nominated as MEGACUBES, with maps of several properties as well as emission-line profiles that are provided for each spaxel. All the MEGACUBES are available through a web interface (https://manga.linea.org.br/ or http://www.if.ufrgs.br/~riffel/software/megacubes/). We also defined a final Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) sample, as well as a control sample matching the AGN host galaxy properties. We have analysed the stellar populations and spatially resolved emission-line diagnostic diagrams of these AGNs and compared them with the control galaxies sample. We find that the relative fractions of young ($t \leq $56 Myr) and intermediate-age (100 Myr $\leq t \leq$ 2 Gyr) show predominantly a positive gradient for both AGNs and controls. The relative fraction of intermediate-age stellar population is higher in AGN hosts when compared to the control sample, and this difference becomes larger for higher [O III] luminosity AGNs. We attribute this to the fact that extra gas is available in these more luminous sources and that it most likely originates from mass-loss from the intermediate-age stars. The spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams reveal that the AGN emission is concentrated in the inner 0.5 $R_e$ (effective radius) region of the galaxies, showing that the AGN classification is aperture dependent and that emission-line ratios have to be taken together with the H$\alpha$ equivalent width for proper activity classification. We present a composite "BPT+WHAN" diagram that produces a more comprehensive mapping of the gas excitation.
