  Asymmetric emission of gravitational waves during mergers of black holes (BHs) produces a recoil kick, which can set a newly formed BH on a bound orbit around the center of its host galaxy, or even completely eject it. To study this population of recoiling BHs we extract properties of galaxies with merging BHs from Illustris TNG300 simulation and then employ both analytical and numerical techniques to model unresolved process of BH recoil.   This comparative analysis between analytical and numerical models shows that, on cosmological scales, numerically modeled recoiling BHs have a higher escape probability and predict a greater number of offset active galactic nuclei (AGN). BH escaped probability $&gt;40~ \%$ is expected in 25 $\%$ of merger remnants in numerical models, compared to 8$\%$ in analytical models. At the same time, the predicted number of offset AGN at separations $&gt;5$ kpc changes from 58 $\%$ for numerical models to 3 $\%$ for analytical models. Since BH ejections in major merger remnants occur in non-virialized systems, static analytical models cannot provide an accurate description. Thus we argue that numerical models should be used to estimate the expected number density of escaped BHs and offset AGN.

  We present the results of photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaigns of the changing look AGN NGC~2617 carried out from 2016 until 2022 and covering the wavelength range from the X-ray to the near-IR. The facilities included the telescopes of the SAI MSU, MASTER Global Robotic Net, the 2.3-m WIRO telescope, Swift, and others. We found significant variability at all wavelengths and, specifically, in the intensities and profiles of the broad Balmer lines. We measured time delays of ~ 6 days (~ 8 days) in the responses of the H-beta (H-alpha) line to continuum variations. We found the X-ray variations to correlate well with the UV and optical (with a small time delay of a few days for longer wavelengths). The K-band lagged the B band by 14 +- 4 days during the last 3 seasons, which is significantly shorter than the delays reported previously by the 2016 and 2017--2019 campaigns. Near-IR variability arises from two different emission regions: the outer part of the accretion disc and a more distant dust component. The HK-band variability is governed primarily by dust. The Balmer decrement of the broad-line components is inversely correlated with the UV flux. The change of the object's type, from Sy1 to Sy1.8, was recorded over a period of ~ 8 years. We interpret these changes as a combination of two factors: changes in the accretion rate and dust recovery along the line of sight.

  Some key issues in AGN and galaxy formation are discussed. Very successful Unified Models explain much of the variety of AGN with orientation effects; ingredients are shadowing by a dusty "torus" and relativistic beaming. A spinoff result is described which is important for the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. It's the most spectacular and unequivocal AGN feedback phenomenon known. This is the so-called "alignment effect" in powerful radio galaxies at z&gt;~1. One of them is a BAL radio galaxy! I explain a very robust derivation of the reddening law for nuclear dust, which reveals a dearth of small grains. Then the quasistatic thin accretion disk model, thought by many to explain the energetically dominant optical/UV continuum, is thoroughly debunked. Much of this was known when the model was proposed 35 years ago. A new argument is given that trivially falsifies a huge superset of such models. It's possible to see the central engine spectrum with the atomic and dust emission surgically removed! Few noticed this breakthrough work. The far IR dust emission in Cygnus A is 10% polarized, and so far high nuclear dust polarization is seen in all radio loud objects, but no radio quiet ones.

  Double-peaked profiles associated with the broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are regarded as the clearest evidence of the presence of an accretion disk. They are most commonly detected by means of optical spectroscopy in the Balmer lines and in the Mg II $\lambda$2798 ultraviolet line. Here, we report the first unambiguous detection of a double-peak broad emission line associated with the O I $\lambda$11297 emission line in the near-infrared (NIR) in the local Seyfert 1 galaxy III Zw 002. Additionally, we detect simultaneously in the spectrum the double-peak emission in the Pa$\alpha$ line and very likely in the He II $\lambda$10830. This is the first time that several broad double-peaked NIR emission lines have been detected simultaneously. The double-peaked profiles are fit using a disk-based model, with an additional Gaussian component attributed to nondisk clouds, which represents the classical BLR. Our results obtained from the fits reveal important parameters, such as disk inclination and geometry. From the double-peaked profile fits, we suggest that the BLR in III Zw 002 has a disk-like geometry, as it extends up to the outer edge of the BLR.

  We present 12 new AGN at 4&lt;z&lt;7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z=10.6) revealed through the detection of a Broad Line Region as seen in Halpha. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases we find evidence for two broad components of Halpha which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs). The inferred BH masses range between 8 x 10^7 Msun down to 4 x 10^5 Msun, interestingly probing the regime expected for Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs). The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities (~10^44-10^45 erg/s) imply accretion rates that are &lt; 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with M_BH ~ 10^6 Msun, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BH at z~4-11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies stellar masses when compared to the local M_BH-Mstar relation, and even approaching M_BH~Mstar, as expected for DCBHs and super-Eddington scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M_BH and velocity dispersion, as well as between M_BH and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the BPT excitation-diagnostic diagram these AGN are located in the region that is that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what expected for AGN hosted in metal poor galaxies (Z ~ 0.1-0.2 Zsun). The fraction of broad line AGN with L_AGN &gt; 10^44 erg/s, among galaxies in the redshift range 4&lt;z&lt;6, is about 10%, suggesting that the contribution of AGN and their hosts to the reionization of the Universe is &gt; 10%.
