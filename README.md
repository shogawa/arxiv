  The spectroscopic survey of the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is expected to obtain a huge number of slitless spectra, including more than one hundred million galaxy spectra and millions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) spectra. By making use of these spectra, we can measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals over large redshift ranges with excellent precisions. In this work, we predict the CSST measurements of the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectra at 0&lt;z&lt;1.2 and pre-reconstruction AGN power spectra at 0&lt;z&lt;4, and derive the BAO signals at different redshift bins by constraining the BAO scaling parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Our result shows that the CSST spectroscopic survey can provide accurate BAO measurements with precisions higher than 1% and 3% for the galaxy and AGN surveys, respectively. By comparing with current measurements in the same range at low redshifts, this can improve the precisions by a factor of $2\sim3$, and similar precisions can be obtained in the pessimistic case. We also investigate the constraints on the cosmological parameters using the measured BAO data by the CSST, and obtain stringent constraint results for the energy density of dark matter, Hubble constant, and equation of state of dark energy.

  The eFEDS is a wide $\approx$ 140 deg$^2$ field that has extensive multiwavelength coverage. To improve the utility of the existing data, we use CIGALE to fit source Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from X-rays to far-infrared (FIR) mainly to derive stellar masses (M*) and star-formation rates (SFRs) for normal galaxies and X-ray Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The catalog consists of 2,057,027 galaxies and 10,373 X-ray AGNs located in the $\approx$ 60 deg$^2$ GAMA09 sub-field. Comparing our M* with other available catalogs and our SFRs with FIR-derived SFRs, we demonstrate the general reliability of our SED-fitting measurements. Our catalog is publicly available at 10.5281/zenodo.10127224.

  In this paper, we present the Heavy Metal Survey, which obtained ultra-deep medium-resolution spectra of 21 massive quiescent galaxies at $1.4\lesssim z\lesssim 2.2$ with Keck/LRIS and MOSFIRE. With integration times of up to 16 hrs per band per galaxy, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in atmospheric windows. We successfully derive spectroscopic redshifts for all 21 galaxies and for 19 we also measure stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_v$), ages, and elemental abundances, as detailed in an accompanying paper. Except for one emission-line AGN, all galaxies are confirmed as quiescent through their faint or absent H$\alpha$ emission and evolved stellar spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint H$\alpha$, elevated [NII]/H$\alpha$ suggests a non-star-forming origin. We calculate dynamical masses ($M_{\rm dyn}$) by combining $\sigma_v$ with structural parameters obtained from HST/COSMOS(-DASH), and compare them with stellar masses ($M_*$) derived using spectrophotometric modeling, considering various assumptions. For a fixed initial mass function (IMF), we observe a strong correlation between $M_{\rm dyn}/M_*$ and $\sigma_v$. This correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with high-$\sigma_v$ galaxies being more bottom-heavy, was already in place at $z\sim2$. When implementing the $\sigma_v$-dependent IMF found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies and correcting for biases in our stellar mass and size measurements, we find a low scatter in $M_{\rm dyn}/M_*$ of 0.14 dex. However, these assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which exceed the dynamical masses by 34%. This tension suggests that distant quiescent galaxies do not simply grow inside-out into today's massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more complicated.

  In the HST/COS spectrum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy 2MASX J14292507+4518318, we have identified a narrow absorption line (NAL) outflow system with a velocity of -151 km s$^{-1}$ This outflow exhibits absorption troughs from the resonance states of ions like CIV, NV, SiIV, and SiII, as well as excited states from CII*, and SiII*. Our investigation of the outflow involved measuring ionic column densities and conducting photoionization analysis. These yield the total column density of the outflow to be estimated as $\log N_{H}$=19.84 [cm$^{-2}]$, its ionization parameter to be $\log U_{H}$=$-$2.0 and its electron number density equal to $\log n_{e}$= 2.75[cm$^{-3}$]. These measurements enabled us to determine the mass-loss rate and the kinetic luminosity of the outflow system to be $Mdot$=0.22[$M_{Sun}$$yr^{-1}$] and $\log Edot_{K}$=39.3 [erg s$^{-1}$], respectively. We have also measured the location of the outflow system to be at $\sim$275 pc from the central source. This outflow does not contribute to the AGN feedback processes due to the low ratio of the outflow's kinetic luminosity to the AGN's Eddington luminosity ($Edot_{K}/L_{Edd}\approx 0.00025 \%$). This outflow is remarkably similar to the two bipolar lobe outflows observed in the Milky Way by XMM-Newton and Chandra.

  By performing global hydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs with driven turbulence models, we demonstrate that elevated levels of turbulence induce highly stochastic migration torques on low-mass companions embedded in these discs. This scenario applies to planets migrating within gravito-turbulent regions of protoplanetary discs as well as stars and black holes embedded in the outskirts of active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion discs. When the turbulence level is low, linear Lindblad torques persists in the background of stochastic forces and its accumulative effect can still dominate over relatively long timescales. However, in the presence of very stronger turbulence, classical flow patterns around the companion embedded in the disc are disrupted, leading to significant deviations from the expectations of classical Type I migration theory over arbitrarily long timescales. Our findings suggest that the stochastic nature of turbulent migration can prevent low-mass companions from monotonically settling into universal migration traps within the traditional laminar disc framework, thus reducing the frequency of three-body interactions and hierarchical mergers compared to previously expected. We propose a scaling for the transition mass ratio from classical to chaotic migration $q\propto \alpha_R$, where $\alpha_R$ is the Reynolds viscosity stress parameter, which can be further tested and refined by conducting extensive simulations over the relevant parameter space.

  We present the main results from a long-term reverberation mapping campaign carried out for the Seoul National University Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Monitoring Project. High-quality data were obtained during 2015-2021 for 32 luminous AGNs (i.e., continuum luminosity in the range of $10^{44-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$) at a regular cadence, of 20-30 days for spectroscopy and 3-5 days for photometry. We obtain time lag measurements between the variability in the H$\beta$ emission and the continuum for 32 AGNs; twenty-five of those have the best lag measurements based on our quality assessment, examining correlation strength, and the posterior lag distribution. Our study significantly increases the current sample of reverberation-mapped AGNs, particularly at the moderate to high luminosity end. Combining our results with literature measurements, we derive a H$\beta$ broad line region size--luminosity relation with a shallower slope than reported in the literature. For a given luminosity, most of our measured lags are shorter than the expectation, implying that single-epoch black hole mass estimators based on previous calibrations could suffer large systematic uncertainties.

  A recently released XMM-Newton technical note has revealed a significant calibration issue between NuSTAR and XMM-Newton EPIC, and provided an empirical correction to EPIC effective area. To quantify the bias caused by the calibration issue to joint analysis of XMM-NuSTAR spectra and verify the effectiveness of the correction, in this work we perform joint-fitting of NuSTAR and EPIC-pn spectra for a large sample of 104 observation pairs of 44 X-ray bright AGN. The spectra were extracted after requiring perfect simultaneity between XMM-Newton and NuSTAR exposures (merging GTIs from two missions) to avoid bias due to rapid spectral variability of AGN. Before the correction, the EPIC-pn spectra are systematically harder than corresponding NuSTAR spectra by $\Delta \Gamma \sim 0.1$, subsequently yielding significantly underestimated cutoff energy $E_{\rm cut} $ and the strength of reflection component R when performing joint-fitting. We confirm the correction is highly effective and can commendably erase the discrepancy in best-fit $\Gamma$, $E_{\rm cut} $ and R, and thus we urge the community to apply the correction when joint-fitting XMM-NuSTAR spectra. Besides, we show that as merging GTIs from two missions would cause severe loss of NuSTAR net exposure time, in many cases joint-fitting yields no advantage compared with utilizing NuSTAR data alone. We finally present a technical note on filtering periods of high background flares for XMM-Newton EPIC-pn exposures in the Small Window mode.

  All very massive early-type galaxies contain supermassive blackholes but are these blackholes all sufficiently active to produce detectable radio continuum sources? We have used the 887.5~MHz Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey DR1 to measure the radio emission from morphological early-type galaxies brighter than $K_S=9.5$ selected from the 2MASS Redshift Survey, HyperLEDA and RC3. In line with previous studies, we find median radio power increases with infrared luminosity, with $P_{1.4} \propto L_K^{2.2}$, although the scatter about this relation spans several orders of magnitude. All 40 of the $M_K&lt;-25.7$ early-type galaxies in our sample have measured radio flux densities that are more than $2\sigma$ above the background noise, with $1.4~{\rm GHz}$ radio powers spanning $\sim 3 \times 10^{20}$ to $\sim 3\times 10^{25}~{\rm W~Hz^{-1}}$. Cross matching our sample with integral field spectroscopy of early-type galaxies reveals that the most powerful radio sources preferentially reside in galaxies with relatively low angular momentum (i.e. slow rotators). While the infrared colours of most galaxies in our early-type sample are consistent with passive galaxies with negligible star formation and the radio emission produced by active galactic nuclei or AGN remnants, very low levels of star formation could power the weakest radio sources with little effect on many other star formation rate tracers.

  We present a comprehensive analysis of approximately $15$ years ($2006-2021$) of X-ray observations of UGC~6728, a low-mass bare AGN, for the first time. Our study encompasses both spectral and temporal aspects of this source. The spectral properties of this source are studied using various phenomenological and physical models. We conclude that (a) the observed variability in X-ray luminosity is not attributed to the Hydrogen column density ($N_H$) as UGC~6728 exhibits a bare nucleus, implying a negligible $N_H$ contribution along the line of sight, and (b) the spectral slope in the X-ray band demonstrates a systematic variation over time, indicating a transition from a relatively hard state to a comparatively soft state. We propose that the underlying accretion dynamics around the central object account for this behavior. By performing X-ray spectral fitting, we estimate the mass of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in UGC~6728 to be $M_{BH}=(7.13\pm1.23)\times10^5$ M$_\odot$ with spin $a=0.97^{+0.20}_{-0.27}$ and inclination angle $i=49.5\pm14.5$ degree. Based on our spectral and temporal analysis, we suggest that UGC~6728 lacks a prominent Compton hump or exhibits a very subtle hump that remains undetectable in our analysis. Furthermore, the high-energy X-ray photons in this source are likely to originate from the low-energy X-ray photons through inverse Compton scattering in a Compton cloud, highlighting a connection between the emission in two energy ranges. We notice a strong soft excess component in the initial part of our observations, which later reduced substantially. This variation of soft excess is explained in view of accretion dynamics.

  Radio sources with peaked spectra (peaked spectrum sources, PSS) and compact symmetric objects (CSO) are powerful, compact, and presumably young AGNs and therefore particularly suitable to study aspects of the AGN-host connection. We use a statistical approach to compare a PSS-CSO sample with a matching comparison sample of extended sources (ECS). We find significant differences between the two samples. In particular, we find that the ECS sample has a higher proportion of passive galaxies with a lower star formation activity. This applies to both sub-samples of QSOs or radio galaxies as well as to the entire sample. The star formation rates of the PSS-CSO host galaxies are typically in the range 0 to 5 M_sun/yr and the stellar masses are in the range 3x10^11 to 10^12 M_sun. Secondly, in agreement with previous results, we find a remarkably high proportion of PSS-CSO host galaxies with merger signatures. The merger fraction of the PSS-CSO sample is 0.61, which is significantly higher than that of the comparison sample (0.15). We suggest that this difference can be explained by assuming that the majority of the PSSs and CSOs cannot evolve to extended radio sources and are therefore not represented in our comparison sample.

  This review presents the main points of current advances in the field of active galactic nuclei (AGN). A brief historical excursion about the search for the nature of AGN is given. The problem of close binary systems consisting of supermassive black holes located in the centers of galaxies is discussed in details. The main characteristics, as well as new methods for studying and ``weighing'' these new objects, are described. This paper is based on a presentation made in the astrophysical seminar, which dedicated to the memory of the outstanding astrophysicist N.G. Bochkarev (took place on May 19, 2023 at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of Moscow State University).

  We analyze the evolution of massive (log$_{10}$ [$M_\star/M_\odot$] $&gt;10$) galaxies at $z \sim$ 4--8 selected from the JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We infer the physical properties of all galaxies in the CEERS NIRCam imaging through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with dense basis to select a sample of high redshift massive galaxies. Where available we include constraints from additional CEERS observing modes, including 18 sources with MIRI photometric coverage, and 28 sources with spectroscopic confirmations from NIRSpec or NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy. We sample the recovered posteriors in stellar mass from SED fitting to infer the volume densities of massive galaxies across cosmic time, taking into consideration the potential for sample contamination by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the evolving abundance of massive galaxies tracks expectations based on a constant baryon conversion efficiency in dark matter halos for $z \sim$ 1--4. At higher redshifts, we observe an excess abundance of massive galaxies relative to this simple model. These higher abundances can be explained by modest changes to star formation physics and/or the efficiencies with which star formation occurs in massive dark matter halos, and are not in tension with modern cosmology.
