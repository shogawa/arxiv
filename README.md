  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the main candidates for ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) sources. However, while theoretical and some phenomenological works favor AGNs as the main sources, recent works have shown that using the very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray flux as a proxy for the UHECR flux leads to a bad agreement with data. In this context, the energy spectrum and composition data are hardly fitted. At the same time, the arrival directions map is badly described and a spurious dipole direction is produced. In this work, we propose a possible solution to these contradictions. Using the observed $\gamma$-ray flux as a proxy may carry the implicit assumption of beamed UHECR emission and, consequently, its beam will remain collimated up to its detection on Earth. We show that assuming an isotropic UHECR emission and correcting the $\gamma$-ray emission proxy by Doppler boosting can overcome the problem. The combined fit of the spectrum and composition is improved by $3.56\sigma$, while the predicted arrival directions agree much better with the data. In particular, a spurious direction of the dipole can be reduced from $10.3 \ (5.4)\sigma$ away from the data to $2.2 \ (1.5)\sigma$ for $E &gt; 8$ EeV ($E &gt; 32$ EeV). We also show that this effect is particularly important when including AGNs of different classes in the same analysis, such as radio galaxies and blazars.

  Resolving the inner structures of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provides the "standard ruler" to measure the parallax distances of the Universe and a powerful way to weigh supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Thanks to time-domain observations, it is possible to use the reverberation mapping (RM) technique to measure time delays between different light curves that probe the structures of the SMBH accretion disks and broad line regions (BLRs), which are otherwise often too compact to be spatially resolved for most AGNs. Despite decades of RM studies, the critical physical process that controls the structures of SMBH accretion disk and BLR and their temporal evolution remains unclear. Here we report the variation of the SMBH accretion disk structure of NGC 4151 in response to changes in luminosity within 6 years. In the high-flux state, the time delays measured from our continuum RM with high-cadence (2 days) spectroscopy are 3.8 times larger than that in the low-flux state and 15 times longer than the classical standard thin disk (SSD) prediction. This result provides the first piece of direct evidence that the SMBH disk structure "breathes" in highly-variable AGN manifestations. The time-delay change severely challenges the popular X-ray reprocessing of the SSD model, with or without BLR contributions. More importantly, the continuum time delays can be comparable with the time delay between the broad Hb line and the nearby optical continuum, and the latter is commonly used to calculate the BLR sizes. Hence, the BLR sizes are significantly underestimated if the continuum time delays are not properly considered. This underestimation introduces up to 0.3 dex systematic uncertainties on RM SMBH masses and BLR parallax distances. Our findings underscore that simultaneous continuum and BLR RM studies are vital for better deciphering the SMBH mass growth and the cosmological expansion history.

  We present a deep X-Shooter rest-frame UV to optical spectral analysis of the heavily reddened quasar, ULASJ2315+043 at z=2.566, known to reside in a major-merger host galaxy. The rest-frame optical is best-fit by a dust-reddened quasar E(B-V)_QSO = 1.55 with black-hole mass log10(Hbeta, MBH [M_sol]) = 10.26 +\- 0.05, bolometric luminosity L_Bol = 10^48.16 erg s^-1 and Eddington-scaled accretion rate log10(\lambda_Edd) = -0.19. We find remarkable similarities between ULASJ2315+043 and the high-redshift Little Red Dots (LRDs). The rest-frame UV cannot be explained by a dusty quasar component alone and requires an additional blue component consistent with either a star-forming host galaxy or scattered AGN light. We detect broad high-ionisation emission lines in the rest-UV, supporting the scattered light interpretation for the UV excess. The scattering fraction represents just 0.05% of the total luminosity of ULASJ2315+043. Analysis of the mid infra-red SED suggests an absence of hot dust on torus-scales similar to what is observed for LRDs. The obscuring medium is therefore likely on galaxy scales. We detect narrow, blueshifted associated absorption line systems in CIV, NV, SiIV and SiIII. There is evidence for significant high-velocity (&gt;1000 km s^-1) outflows in both the broad and narrow line regions as traced by CIV and [OIII] emission. The kinetic power of the [OIII] wind is e_ion = 10^44.61 erg s^-1 ~ 0.001 L_Bol. ULASJ2315+043 is likely in an important transition phase where star formation, black-hole accretion and multi-phase gas flows are simultaneously occurring.
