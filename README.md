  The Time Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES) conducted on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) will perform spectroscopic follow-up of extragalactic transients discovered in the era of the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. TiDES will conduct a 5-year survey, covering ${&gt;}14\,000\,\mathrm{square\, degrees}$, and use around 250 000 fibre hours to address three main science goals: (i) spectroscopic observations of ${&gt;}30 000$ live transients, (ii) comprehensive follow-up of ${&gt;}200 000$ host galaxies to obtain redshift measurements, and (iii) repeat spectroscopic observations of Active Galactic Nuclei to enable reverberation mapping studies. The live spectra from TiDES will be used to reveal the diversity and astrophysics of both normal and exotic supernovae across the luminosity-timescale plane. The extensive host-galaxy redshift campaign will allow exploitation of the larger sample of supernovae and improve photometric classification, providing the largest-ever sample of spec-confirmed type Ia supernovae, capable of a sub-2 per cent measurement of the equation-of-state of dark energy. Finally, the TiDES reverberation mapping experiment of 700--1\,000 AGN will complement the SN Ia sample and extend the Hubble diagram to $z\sim2.5$

  This study investigates the thermal stability of thin accretion disks in high-energy astrophysical systems, incorporating the effects of magnetic fields, winds, and coronae. We analyze how these factors influence disk stability, focusing on conditions under which magnetic fields enhance stability and on scenarios where winds and coronae can either stabilize or destabilize the disk. Our results reveal that increasing corona parameters raises disk thickness and reduces temperature, thereby affecting gas, radiation, and magnetic pressures. These interactions underscore the complex dependencies that shape accretion disk dynamics, offering insights into their structural and thermal behavior under varying physical conditions. The findings contribute to advancing theoretical models and numerical simulations of accretion processes in environments such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries, where disk stability plays a critical role in observed emissions and variability patterns.

  PS16dtm is one of the earliest reported candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and displays a remarkably bright and long-lived infrared (IR) echo revealed by multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). After a rapid rise in the first year, the echo remains persistently at a high state from July 2017 to July 2024, the latest epoch, and keeps an almost constant color. We have fitted the extraordinary IR emission with a refined dust echo model by taking into account the dust sublimation process. The fitting suggests that an extremely giant dust structure with a new inner radius of $\sim1.6$ pc and an ultra-high peak bolometric luminosity, i.e., $\sim6\times10^{46} \rm erg~s^{-1}$ for typical 0.1$\mu$m-sized silicate grain, is required to account for the IR echo. This work highlights the distinctive value of IR echoes in measuring the accurate intrinsic bolometric luminosity, and thus the total radiated energy of TDEs, which could be severely underestimated by traditional methods, i.e. probably by more than an order of magnitude in PS16dtm. Such large energetic output compared to normal TDEs could be boosted by the pre-existing accretion disk and gas clouds around the black hole. Our model can be validated in the near future by IR time-domain surveys such as Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, given the recent retirement of WISE. In addition, the potential for spatially resolving a receding dusty torus after a TDE could also be an exciting subject in the era of advanced IR interferometry.

  We present a composite machine learning framework to estimate posterior probability distributions of bulge-to-total light ratio, half-light radius, and flux for Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within $z&lt;1.4$ and $m&lt;23$ in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide survey. We divide the data into five redshift bins: low ($0&lt;z&lt;0.25$), mid ($0.25&lt;z&lt;0.5$), high ($0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9$), extra ($0.9&lt;z&lt;1.1$) and extreme ($1.1&lt;z&lt;1.4$), and train our models independently in each bin. We use PSFGAN to decompose the AGN point source light from its host galaxy, and invoke the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) to estimate morphological parameters of the recovered host galaxy. We first trained our models on simulated data, and then fine-tuned our algorithm via transfer learning using labeled real data. To create training labels for transfer learning, we used GALFIT to fit $\sim 20,000$ real HSC galaxies in each redshift bin. We comprehensively examined that the predicted values from our final models agree well with the GALFIT values for the vast majority of cases. Our PSFGAN + GaMPEN framework runs at least three orders of magnitude faster than traditional light-profile fitting methods, and can be easily retrained for other morphological parameters or on other datasets with diverse ranges of resolutions, seeing conditions, and signal-to-noise ratios, making it an ideal tool for analyzing AGN host galaxies from large surveys coming soon from the Rubin-LSST, Euclid, and Roman telescopes.

  The origin of the variability in accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still unknown, but its behavior can be characterized by modeling the time series of optical wavelength fluxes coming from the accretion disks with damped random walk (DRW) being the most popular model for this purpose. The DRW is modeled by a characteristic fluctuation amplitude and damping timescale {\tau}, with the latter being potentially related to the mass and accretion rate onto the massive black hole. The estimation of {\tau} is challenging, with commonly used methods such as the maximum likelihood (ML) and the least square error (LSE) resulting in biased estimators. This problem arises most commonly for three reasons: i) the light curve has been observed with additive noise; ii) some cadence scheme; iii) when the autocorrelation parameter is close to one. The latter is called the unit root problem. In order to improve these parameter estimation procedures for estimating {\tau}, we developed a simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) methodology in the context of time series analysis. We consider both the standard class of autoregressive processes observed at regular intervals and a recently developed class of irregularly autoregressive processes (iAR). The performance of the SIMEX estimation method was evaluated under conditions of near-unit-root behavior and additive noise through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo experiments confirm that the SIMEX approach outperforms MLE and LSE methods, offering a reduction in estimation bias ranging from 30% to 90%. Real-data applications further validate the methodology, yielding better model fits and lower mean squared errors (MSE). The more accurate estimation of the damping timescale parameter can help to better understand the currently tentative links between DRW and physical parameters in AGN.

  The Doppler factor ($\delta$) is a fundamental quality for the relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). It is also fundamental to assessing the number of the entire population of the jetted AGN at high redshift ($z$), and therefore is important for tracing the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) across cosmic time. Here we present the identification of the positive cosmic evolution of the Doppler factor in {\it Fermi}-detected bright $\gamma-$ray blazars. The redshift dependence of the Doppler factor, $\delta\propto(1+z)^{0.8}$, is measured from the observed characteristic energies in the gamma-ray spectra of 141 blazars. Moreover, the analysis of the characteristic timescales derived from modeling the long-term optical light curves of 89 blazars with Gaussian process regression gives $\delta\propto(1+z)^{1.1}$, but with a larger scatter. \textbf{Note that each index is derived from the entire sample, representing an average evolution. Interestingly, the index itself also appears to evolve, with low-luminosity sources showing stronger evolution, as indicated by a larger index.} This detection straightly suggests that relativistic jets from AGNs are much more common at high redshifts than what is previously estimated.   

Constraining Disk-to-Corona Power Transfer Fraction, Soft X-ray Excess

  Understanding the nature of the accretion disk, its interplay with the X-ray corona, and assessing black hole spin demographics are some open challenges in astrophysics. In this work, we examine the predictions of the standard $\alpha$-disk model, origin of the soft X-ray excess, and measure the black hole spin parameter by applying the updated high-density disk reflection model to the XMM-Newton/NuSTAR broadband (0.3$-$78 keV) X-ray spectra of a sample of Type-1 AGN. Our Bayesian analysis confirms that the high-density relativistic reflection model with a broken power-law emissivity profile can simultaneously fit the soft X-ray excess, broad iron K line, and Compton hump for $\sim$70% of the sample, while an additional warm Comptonization model is still required to describe the observed soft X-ray excess for the remaining sources. Our first-ever calculation of the disk-to-corona power transfer fraction reveals that the fraction of power released from the accretion disk into the hot corona can have diverse values, the sample median of which is $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.2}$. We find that the transferred power from the accretion disk can potentially soften the X-ray spectrum of the hot corona. The median values of the hot coronal temperature and optical depth for the sample are estimated to be $63_{-11}^{+23}$ keV and $0.85_{-0.27}^{+0.12}$, respectively. Finally, through joint XMM-Newton+NuSTAR relativistic reflection spectroscopy, we systematically constrain the black hole spin parameter across the broad range of black hole masses, $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) \sim 5.5-9.0$, and increase the available spin measurements in the AGN population by $\sim$20%.

  Studying the interstellar medium in nearby starbursts is essential for understanding the physical mechanisms driving these objects, thought to resemble young star-forming galaxies. This study aims to analyze the physical properties of the first spatially-resolved multi-wavelength SED of an extragalactic source, spanning six decades in frequency (from near-UV to cm wavelengths) at an angular resolution of 3$^{\prime\prime}$ (51 pc at the distance of NGC,253). We focus on the central molecular zone (CMZ) of NGC,253, which contains giant molecular clouds (GMCs) responsible for half of the galaxy's star formation. We use archival data, spanning optical to centimeter wavelengths, to compute SEDs with the GalaPy and CIGALE codes for validation, and analyze stellar optical spectra with the \textsc{starlight} code.   Our results show significant differences between central and external GMCs in terms of stellar and dust masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and bolometric luminosities. We identify the best SFR tracers as radio continuum bands at 33 GHz, radio recombination lines, and the total infrared luminosity (L$_{\rm IR}$; 8-1000$\mu$m), as well as 60$\mu$m IR emission. BPT and WHAN diagrams indicate shock signatures in NGC~253's nuclear region, associating it with AGN/star-forming hybrids, though the AGN fraction is negligible ($\leq$7.5%). Our findings show significant heterogeneity in the CMZ, with central GMCs exhibiting higher densities, SFRs, and dust masses compared to external GMCs. We confirm that certain centimeter photometric bands can reliably estimate global SFR at GMC scales.
