  A stellar system is dynamically hot when its kinetic energy is dominated by random motion represented by the velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm hot} (M_*)$. We use MaNGA data to obtain inner and outer dispersion of a galaxy, $\sigma_{\rm in}$ and $\sigma_{\rm out}$, to characterize its dynamical status and study its connection with star formation quenching and the growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH). We divide galaxies into fully quenched (FQGs), partially quenched (PQGs) and fully star-forming (FSGs) populations, and identify quenched central cores (QCCs) in PQGs. The galaxy distribution in $\sigma_{\rm in}/\sigma_{\rm hot}$-$\sigma_{\rm out}/\sigma_{\rm hot}$ diagram is L-shaped, consisting of a horizontal sequence ($\sigma_{\rm out}/\sigma_{\rm hot}\sim0$) and a vertical sequence ($\sigma_{\rm in}/\sigma_{\rm hot}\sim1$). FQGs and QCCs are located at the top of vertical sequence, $\sigma_{\rm out}/\sigma_{\rm hot}\sim1$, therefore they are dynamically hot over their entire bodies. PQGs reside along vertical sequence, so they have hot center but cold outskirt. FSGs are diverse and can be found in both sequences. Galaxy structural properties, star formation and AGN activities make a transition along horizontal sequence at $\log(\sigma_{\rm in}/\sigma_{\rm hot})\sim-0.3$, and along vertical sequence at $\log(\sigma_{\rm out}/\sigma_{\rm hot})\sim-0.3$. The fractions of optical AGNs and barred galaxies increase rapidly in the first transition and decline rapidly in the second; radio galaxies are located at the top of vertical sequence. Our results demonstrate that star formation quenching and SMBH growth are effective only in dynamically hot systems. A simple model along this line can reproduce the observed SMBH scaling relations. We discuss how secular processes and strong interactions can make a system dynamically hot, and lead to the SMBH growth and star formation quenching.

  We analyse the integral-field spectroscopy data for the $\approx10,000$ galaxies in final data release of the MaNGA survey. We identify 188 galaxies for which the emission lines cannot be described by single Gaussian components. These galaxies can be classified into (1) 38 galaxies with broad $H\alpha$ and [OIII] $\lambda$5007 lines, (2) 101 galaxies with broad $H\alpha$ lines but no broad [OIII] $\lambda$5007 lines, and (3) 49 galaxies with double-peaked narrow emission lines. Most of the broad line galaxies are classified as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from their line ratios. The catalogue helps us further understand the AGN-galaxy coevolution through the stellar population of broad-line region host galaxies and the relation between broad lines' properties and the host galaxies' dynamical properties. The stellar population properties (including mass, age and metallicity) of broad-line host galaxies suggest there is no significant difference between narrow-line Seyfert-2 galaxies and Type-1 AGN with broad $H\alpha$ lines. We use the broad-$H\alpha$ line width and luminosity to estimate masses of black hole in these galaxies, and test the $M_{BH}-\sigma_{e}$ relation in Type-1 AGN host galaxies. Furthermore we find three dual AGN candidates supported by radio images from the VLA FIRST survey. This sample may be useful for further studies on AGN activities and feedback processes.

  The existence of luminous quasars (QSO) at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR; i.e. z&gt;6) powered by supermassive black holes (SMBH) with masses $\gtrsim10^9~M_\odot$ challenges models of early SMBH formation. To shed light on the nature of these sources we started a multiwavelength programme based on a sample of 18 HYPerluminous quasars at the Epoch of ReionizatION (HYPERION). These are the luminous QSOs whose SMBH must have had the most rapid mass growth during the Universe first Gyr. In this paper we present the HYPERION sample and report on the first of the 3 years planned observations of the 2.4 Ms XMM-Newton Multi-Year Heritage programme on which HYPERION is based. The goal of this programme is to accurately characterise the X-ray nuclear properties of QSOs at the EoR. Through a joint X-ray spectral analysis of 10 sources, covering the rest-frame $\sim2-50$ keV range, we report a steep average photon index ($\Gamma\sim2.4\pm0.1$) which is inconsistent at $\geq4\sigma$ level with the value measured in QSO at z&lt;6. This spectral slope is also significantly steeper than that reported in lower-z QSOs with similar luminosity or accretion rate, thus suggesting a genuine redshift evolution. Alternatively, we can interpret this result as the presence of an unusually low-energy cutoff $E_{cut}\sim20$ keV on a standard $\Gamma=1.9$ power-law. We also report on mild indications that HYPERION QSOs show higher soft X-ray emission at 2 keV compared to the UV one at 2500A than expected by lower-z luminous AGN. We speculate that a redshift-dependent coupling between the X-ray corona and accretion disc or intrinsically different coronal properties may account for the steep spectral slopes, especially in the presence of powerful winds. The reported slopes, if confirmed at lower luminosities, may have an important impact on the design of future X-ray facilities and surveys aimed at the early Universe.
