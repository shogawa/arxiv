  Faraday rotation is an important probe of the magnetic fields and magnetized plasma around active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. We present a Faraday rotation measure image of the M87 jet between 85.2 GHz and 101.3 GHz with a resolution of ~2" with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We found that the rotation measure (RM) of the M87 core is $\rm (4.5\pm 0.4)\times10^{4}\ rad\ m^{-2}$ with a low linear polarization fraction of $\rm (0.88\pm 0.08)\%$. The spatial RM gradient in the M87 jet spans a wide range from $\sim -2\times10^4\rm~rad\ m^{-2}$ to $\sim 3\times10^4\rm~rad\ m^{-2}$ with a typical uncertainty of $0.3\times10^4\rm~rad\ m^{-2}$. A comparison with previous RM measurements of the core suggests that the Faraday rotation of the core may originate very close to the super massive black hole (SMBH). Both an internal origin and an external screen with a rapidly varying emitting source could be possible. As for the jet, the RM gradient indicates a helical configuration of the magnetic field that persists up to kpc scale. Combined with the kpc-scale RM measurements at lower frequencies, we found that RM is frequency-dependent in the jet. One possible scenario to explain this dependence is that the kpc-scale jet has a trumpet-like shape and the jet coil unwinds near its end.

  Cloud-cloud collisions in splash bridges produced in gas-rich disk galaxy collisions offer a brief but interesting environment to study the effects of shocks and turbulence on star formation rates in the diffuse IGM, far from the significant feedback effects of massive star formation and AGN. Expanding on our earlier work, we describe simulated collisions between counter-rotating disk galaxies of relatively similar mass, focusing on the thermal and kinematic effects of relative inclination and disk offset at the closest approach. This includes essential heating and cooling signatures, which go some way towards explaining the luminous power in H$_2$ and [CII] emission in the Taffy bridge, as well as providing a partial explanation of the turbulent nature of the recently observed compact CO-emitting clouds observed in Taffy by ALMA. The models show counter-rotating disk collisions result in swirling, shearing kinematics for the gas in much of the post-collision bridge. Gas with little specific angular momentum due to collisions between counter-rotating streams accumulates near the center of mass. The disturbances and mixing in the bridge drive continuing cloud collisions, differential shock heating, and cooling throughout. A wide range of relative gas phases and line-of-sight velocity distributions are found in the bridges, depending sensitively on initial disk orientations and the resulting variety of cloud collision histories. Most cloud collisions can occur promptly or persist for quite a long duration. Cold and hot phases can largely overlap throughout the bridge or can be separated into different parts of the bridge.

  We present an analysis of 152,355 radio sources identified in the second data release of the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.00 &lt; z &lt; 0.57. Using Monte Carlo simulations we determine the reliability of each source exhibiting an excess in radio luminosity relative to that predicted from their Ha emission, and, for a subset of 124,023 sources we combine this measurement with a full BPT analysis. Using these two independent diagnostics we determine the reliability of each source hosting a supermassive black hole of high or low Eddington-scaled accretion rate, and combine the measurements to determine the reliability of sources belonging to each of four physical classes of objects: star forming galaxies (SFGs), radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQAGN), and high- or low-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs or emission-line LERGs). The result is a catalogue which enables user-defined samples of radio sources with a reliability threshold suited to their science goal e.g. prioritising purity or completeness. Here we select high-confidence samples of radio sources (&gt;90% reliability) to report: 38,588 radio-excess AGN in the LoTSS DR2 sample (362 HERGs, and 12,648 emission-line LERGs), together with 38,729 SFGs, and 18,726 RQAGN. We validate these results through comparison to literature using independent emission-line measurements, and to widely-adopted WISE photometric selection techniques. While our use of SDSS spectroscopy limits our current analysis to ~4 percent of the LoTSS-DR2 catalogue, our method is directly applicable to data from the forthcoming WEAVE-LOFAR survey which will obtain over a million spectra of 144 MHz selected sources.

  For the first time, we systematically search for galaxies with extended emission line and potential outflows features using medium-band images in the GOODS-S field by comparing the morphology in medium-band images to adjacent continuum and UV bands. We look for galaxies that have a maximum extent 50\% larger, an excess area 30\% greater, or an axis ratio difference of more than 0.3 in the medium band compared to the reference bands. After visual inspection, we find 326 candidate galaxies at $1 &lt; z &lt; 6$, with a peak in the population near cosmic noon, benefiting from the good coverage of the medium-band filters. By examining their SEDs, we find that the candidate galaxies are at least 20\% more bursty in their star-forming activity and have 60\% more young stellar populations compared to a control sample selected based on the continuum band flux. Additionally, these candidates exhibit a significantly higher production rate of ionizing photons. We further find that candidates hosting known AGN produce extended emission that is more anisotropic compared to non-AGN candidates. A few of our candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed to have prominent outflow signatures through NIRSpec observations, showcasing the robustness of the photometric selection. Future spectroscopic follow-up will better help verify and characterize the kinematics and chemical properties of these systems.

  We performed spectroscopic analyses of five local compact star-forming galaxies (CSFGs) with extremely high [OIII]/[OII] (O$_{32}$) ratios ($&gt;20$). These targets remarkably share similar properties with high-redshift CIV emitters at $z&gt;6$: high H$\beta$ equivalent widths (EWs $&gt;200$\AA), extreme O$_{32}$ ratios, low metallicities (12+log(O/H) $\lesssim7.8$), low C/O abundances (log(C/O) $&lt;-0.6$), and high ionization conditions (log$U&gt;-2$). The UV spectra were acquired using the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). We have identified a wealth of rest-frame UV emission lines (CIV, HeII, OIII], CIII]) in the HST spectra. Notably, all our targets show intense CIV emission lines with rest-frame EWs $&gt;10$\AA, indicative of hard ionizing radiation. The rest-frame UV emission line diagnostics disfavor an AGN and could be consistent with significant shock contributions to the source of ionizing radiation. Four of our targets show high CIV/CIII] ratios ($\geq1.4$), suggestive of strong Lyman-continuum leakage (LyC escape fraction, $f_{\rm esc,LyC}&gt;10$%) from these sources. This is consistent with their Ly$\alpha$-inferred LyC escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc,LyC}=$ 9 - 31%). We derive relative C/O abundances from our sources, showing log(C/O) values from $-1.12$ to $-0.61$, comparable to those of reionization-era galaxies at $z\gtrsim6$. The properties of the CSFGs, particularly their intense CIV emission and high O$_{32}$ ratios, which suggest significant LyC escape fractions, are similar to those of the reionization-era CIV emitters. These similarities reinforce the hypothesis that these CSFGs are the closest analogs of significant contributors to the reionization of the intergalactic medium.   

Evidence for gravitational self-lensing of the central supermassive
  black hole binary in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1566

  It is generally accepted that all massive galaxies host supermassive black holes (BHs) in their center and that mergers of two galaxies lead to the formation of BH binaries. The most interesting among them comprise the mergers in their final state, that is to say with parsec (3.2 light years) or sub-parsec orbital separations. It is possible to detect these systems with binary self-lensing. Here we report the potential detection of a central supermassive BH binary in the active galaxy (AGN) NGC1566 based on a microlensing outburst. The light curve of the outburst - based on observations with the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae - lasted from the beginning of 2017 until the beginning of 2020. The steep symmetric light curve as well as its shape look very different with respect to normal random variations in AGN. However, the observations could be easily reproduced with a best-fit standard microlensing light curve. Based on the light curve, we derived a characteristic timescale of 155 days. During the outburst, the continuum as well as the broad line intensities varied; however, the narrow emission lines did not. This is an indication that the lensing object orbits the AGN nucleus between the broad line region (BLR) and the narrow line region (NLR), that is, at a distance on the order of 250 light days. The light curve can be reproduced by a lens with a BH mass of 5*10^{5} M_solar. This implies a mass ratio to the central AGN on the order of 1 to 10.

  We present observations of mid-J J=4-3 or J=5-4 carbon monoxide (CO) emission lines and continuum emission from a sample of ten of the most luminous log(L/L_solar)~14 Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) with redshifts up to 4.6. We uncover broad spectral lines (FWHM~400 km/s) in these objects, suggesting a turbulent molecular interstellar medium (ISM) may be ubiquitous in Hot DOGs. A halo of molecular gas, extending out to a radius of 5 kpc is observed in W2305-0039, likely supplied by 940 km/s molecular outflows. W0831+0140 is plausibly the host of a merger between at least two galaxies, consistent with observations made using ionized gas. These CO(4-3) observations contrast with previous CO(1-0) studies of the same sources: the CO(4-3) to CO(1-0) luminosity ratios exceed 300 in each source, suggesting that the lowest excited states of CO are underluminous. These findings show that the molecular gas in Hot DOGs is consistently turbulent, plausibly a consequence of AGN feedback, triggered by galactic mergers.

  We present new results from the ASTRID simulation from $z=3$ to $z=0.5$, covering the epoch of cosmic noon. The galaxy stellar mass function, as well as the black hole mass and luminosity functions in ASTRID, exhibit good agreement with recent observational constraints. We study the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ scaling relation and its connections to AGN luminosity, galaxy color, and star formation rate, demonstrating that AGN feedback plays a crucial role in the quenching of massive galaxies ($M_*&gt;10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$). Although AGN feedback suppresses star formation through quenching, AGN-host galaxies still exhibit statistically higher levels of star formation compared to inactive ones, due to the positive correlation between AGN activity and star formation, both fueled by a shared gas reservoir. The fraction of quiescent galaxies in ASTRID increases with both galaxy mass and redshift evolution, aligning well with observational trends. We find that different quenching mechanisms can leave distinct morphological imprints on quenched galaxies. Massive, compact quiescent galaxies typically experience shorter quenching timescales, have younger central regions, and host overmassive black holes. This is usually due to a compaction-like quenching mechanism that funnels gas into the galaxy center, leading to starbursts and triggering AGN kinetic feedback. In contrast, quiescent galaxies with more diffuse morphologies generally experience `inside-out' quenching, which is characterized by older central regions compared to the outskirts. These galaxies typically experience longer quenching timescales due to quenching processes operating on a larger halo scale, which gradually deplete the galactic star-forming gas.

A Luminous X-ray AGN in the Dwarf-Dwarf Galaxy Merger RGG 66

  We present the discovery of a luminous X-ray AGN in the dwarf galaxy merger RGG 66. The black hole is predicted to have a mass of $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5.4} M_\odot$ and to be radiating close to its Eddington limit ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.75$). The AGN in RGG 66 is notable both for its presence in a late-stage dwarf-dwarf merger and for its luminosity of $L_{\rm 2-10~keV} = 10^{42.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is among the most powerful AGNs known in nearby dwarf galaxies. The X-ray spectrum has a best-fit photon index of $\Gamma = 2.4$ and an intrinsic absorption of $N_H \sim 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. These results come from a follow-up {\it Chandra X-ray Observatory} study of four irregular/disturbed dwarf galaxies with evidence for hosting AGNs based on optical spectroscopy.   The remaining three dwarf galaxies do not have detectable X-ray sources with upper limits of $L_{\rm 2-10~ keV} \lesssim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Taken at face value, our results on RGG 66 suggest that mergers may trigger the most luminous of AGNs in the dwarf galaxy regime, just as they are suspected to do in more massive galaxy mergers.

  The diffuse stellar component of galaxy clusters made up of intergalactic stars is termed the intracluster light (ICL). Though there is a developing understanding of the mechanisms by which the ICL is formed, no strong consensus has yet been reached on which objects the stars of the ICL are primarily sourced from. We investigate the assembly of the ICL starting approximately $10$ Gyr before $z=0$ in 11 galaxy clusters (halo masses between $\sim1\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $\sim7\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ at $z\approx0$) in the Horizon-AGN simulation. By tracking the stars of galaxies that fall into these clusters past cluster infall, we are able to link almost all of the $z\approx0$ ICL back to progenitor objects. Satellite stripping, mergers, and pre-processing are all found to make significant contributions to the ICL, but any contribution from in-situ star-formation directly into the ICL appears negligible. Even after compensating for resolution effects, we find that approximately $90$ per cent of the stacked ICL of the 11 clusters that is not pre-processed should come from galaxies infalling with stellar masses above $10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, with roughly half coming from infalling galaxies with stellar masses within half a dex of $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. The fact that the ICL appears largely sourced from such massive objects suggests that the ICL assembly of any individual cluster may be principally stochastic.
