  Using the Very Long Baseline Array, we observed the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in NGC 3079 over a span of six months to test for variability in the two main parsec-scale radio components, $A$ and $B$, which lie on either side of the AGN. We found evidence for positional differences in the positions of $A$ and $B$ over the six months consistent with the apparent motion of these components extrapolated from older archival data, finding that their projected rate of separation, $(0.040\pm0.003)$ c, has remained constant since $\sim2004$ when a slowdown concurrent with a dramatic brightening of source $A$ occurred. This behavior is consistent with an interaction of source $A$ with the interstellar medium (ISM), as has previously been suggested in the literature. We calculated the amount of mechanical feedback on the ISM for both the scenario in which $A$ is an expulsion of material from the central engine and the scenario in which $A$ is a shock front produced by a relativistic jet, the latter of which is favored by several lines of evidence we discuss. We find that the cumulative mechanical feedback on the ISM is between $2 \times 10^{44}$ erg to $1 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the expulsion scenario or between $3\times 10^{50}$ erg to $1 \times 10^{52}$ erg for the jet scenario. Integrated over the volume-complete FRAMEx sample, our results imply that jet-mode mechanical feedback plays a negligible role in the energetics of AGNs in the local universe.

  (abridged) The overwhelming majority of diagnostic tools for galactic activity are focused on active galaxies. Passive or dormant galaxies are often excluded from these diagnostics which usually employ emission line features. In this work, we use infrared and optical colors in order to build an all-inclusive galactic activity diagnostic tool that can discriminate between star-forming, AGN, LINER, composite, and passive galaxies, and which can be used in local and low-redshift galaxies. We explore classification criteria based on infrared colors from the 3 WISE bands supplemented with optical colors from the u, g, and r SDSS bands. From these we aim to find the minimal combination of colors for optimal results. Furthermore, to mitigate biases related to aperture effects, we introduce a new WISE photometric scheme combing different sized apertures. We develop a diagnostic tool using machine learning methods that includes both active and passive galaxies under one unified scheme using 3 colors. We find that the combination of W1-W2, W2-W3, and g-r colors offers good performance while the broad availability of these colors for a large number of galaxies ensures wide applicability on large galaxy samples. The overall accuracy is $\sim$81% while the achieved completeness for each class is $\sim$81% for star-forming, $\sim$56% for AGN, $\sim$68% for LINER, $\sim$65% for composite, and $\sim$85% for passive galaxies. Our diagnostic provides a significant improvement over existing IR diagnostics by including all types of active, as well as passive galaxies, and extending them to the local Universe. The inclusion of the optical colors improves their performance in identifying low-luminosity AGN which are generally confused with star-forming galaxies, and helps to identify cases of starbursts with extreme mid-IR colors which mimic obscured AGN galaxies, a well-known problem for most IR diagnostics.

  We present an update of the survey of Active Galaxies with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory. This work adds 567 days of HAWC data to the previously published survey, providing a refined analysis of an updated total exposure of 2090 days. The sample includes 138 nearby AGNs from the 3FHL catalog. We fit a modified power-law to their very high energy spectra, including the exponential attenuation caused by the Extragalactic Background Light. We found four sources with significant detections (above 5$\sigma$): the radio galaxy M87 and the BL Lac objects Mkn 421, Mkn 501 and 1ES 1215+303. We also report eight sources with a marginal detection (between 3$\sigma$ and 5$\sigma$) of which seven are classified as BL Lac objects and one as a radio galaxy.
