Statistically, green valley (GV) galaxies exhibit lower molecular gas fractions ($f_{gas}$) and reduced star formation efficiency (SFE) compared to star-forming galaxies. However, it remains unclear whether quenching is primarily driven by one factor or results from a combination of mechanisms in individual GV galaxies. In this study, we address this question by examining the spatial distributions of star formation and molecular gas in 28 GVs selected from the ALMaQUEST survey and additional literature samples. For each galaxy, we identify regions with suppressed specific star formation rate (sSFR) and measure $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE-offsets from the resolved scaling relations of the star-forming main sequence galaxies. By comparing the fraction of regions with negative $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE, we classify 35.7$\pm$13.2\% (57.1$\pm$17.9\%) of GV galaxies as $f_{gas}$-driven, 39.3$\pm$14.0\% (39.3$\pm$14.0\%) as SFE-driven, and 25.0$\pm$10.6\% (3.6$\pm$3.6\%) as mixed mode when adopting a fixed (variable) CO-to-$\rm H_{2}$ conversion factor ($α_{CO}$). These results indicate that GVs undergo quenching through multiple pathways. As sSFR decreases from the main sequence to the green valley, we observe a transition toward predominantly SFE-driven quenching, possibly linked to internal processes such as morphological quenching or AGN activity. We further estimate the quenching timescale ($τ_{decay}$), defined as the time from the peak SFR to 1/e (approximately 37\%) of its value, using integrated MaNGA spectra. SFE-driven quenching is typically associated with short $τ_{decay}$ , while $f_{gas}$-driven quenching shows a broader range. Overall, 75\% of GVs exhibit $τ_{decay}$ shorter than 1 Gyr, suggesting that quenching in most GVs proceeds rapidly, challenging purely slow-quenching scenarios like starvation.

We present new sub-arcsecond ($\sim$0.3-1 arcsec; $\sim$1--3\,kpc) VLA imaging at 1.4\,GHz and 6\,GHz of 29 optically-selected, [O~{\sc iii}] luminous ($L_{\rm [O III]}$ &gt; 10$^{42.1}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$), $z&lt;0.2$ quasars drawn from the expanded Quasar Feedback Survey (QFeedS; with $L_\mathrm{1.4\,GHz} = 10^{22.6}$--10$^{26.3}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$). These 29 new objects occupy the low end of the radio-power distribution ($L_\mathrm{1.4\,GHz}$=$10^{22.63}$--10$^{23.45}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$) in the QFeedS sample and are nominally `radio quiet'. Despite this, we find widespread evidence of AGN-driven synchrotron activity. Nearly $\sim 31\,$per\,cent exhibit resolved radio structures on $\sim$0.1--20\,kpc scales consistent with compact jets or wind-driven outflows, and $\sim 90\,$per\,cent display steep spectra ($α\lesssim -1$) indicative of optically thin synchrotron emission. Combining morphology, spectral index and brightness-temperature diagnostics, at least $\sim38\,$per\,cent of the sample show clear AGN signatures that cannot be explained by star formation alone. These constitute the first results from the expanded QFeedS (now 71 quasars spanning $\approx 4$ dex in radio power) and demonstrate that compact, low-power jets and AGN shocks are common deep inside the radio-quiet regime. A thorough understanding of feedback processes from quasars, deep into the `radio-quiet' regime, will be obtained by connecting these high resolution radio observations with multi-wavelength observations.

Context. X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating, high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts observed from the nuclei of a dozen nearby low-mass galaxies. Their origin remains a puzzle in the physics of accretion variability. Observational data indicate that X-ray and/or optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) may precede QPE detections. Although both kinds of outburst are driven by supermassive black holes, they are more frequently detected in faded active galactic nuclei (AGNs), when the TDE is not happening in a dormant galaxy. In the case of the QPE discovery source, GSN 069, it remains debated whether its past activity arose from a previous AGN phase or from an enhanced TDE rate. Aims. We investigated the origin of the past nuclear activity in GSN 069. Methods. Past AGN activity imprints detectable polarization in optical light, due to the expected delay between direct and scattered light. On 6 September 2019, we targeted GSN 069 with VLT/FORS2 in both imaging polarimetry and spectropolarimetry modes so that its optical polarization could be investigated while the first detected QPE phase was still active. Results. We measured a rising polarization, from ~0% to ~1.5%, as moving away from the nucleus of GSN 069. This rise is probed to be intrinsic to the central engine, confirming the already detected extended emission line region (EELR) by integral field unit data. Conclusions. The increasing radial polarization demonstrates a switched-off nucleus. The polarization angle traces an axis aligned with elongated [OIII], [NII], and Hα gas distributions, revealing an EELR that may be consistent with relic polarization cones, therefore suggesting the presence of a torus-like structure in the past. Thus, optical polarization echoes geometrically favor a faded AGN as the origin of the EELR rather than a past elevated TDE rate, although the latter cannot be excluded.  

One cloud is not enough: extreme conditions bias chemical abundances in high-redshift galaxies

Since its launch, JWST has opened an unprecedented opportunity to characterise the ionised ISM of high-redshift galaxies using well-established rest-frame UV/optical diagnostics from the local Universe. At the same time, these observations challenge the validity of such classical methods when applied to the extreme environments typical at high redshift. We present an in-depth analysis of the ISM in three representative case studies at $z=2 - 6$ (MARTA 4327, the Sunburst Arc and RXCJ2248-ID) conducted within a multi-cloud photoionisation modelling framework (HOMERUN). We show that even a small fraction of unresolved high-density clumps can contribute more than half of the observed flux of auroral lines, while only negligibly to standard optical density tracers. As a result, $T_{\mathrm{e}}$-method metallicities can be underestimated by $\sim 0.15 - 0.3$ dex, as for MARTA 4327. By modelling rest-frame UV and optical data, we demonstrate that discrepancies between abundances obtained from diagnostics tracing different zones do not necessarily imply chemical inhomogeneities. In RXCJ2248-ID, the disagreement between UV and optical N/O may naturally arise from ionisation and density structure alone. In contrast, we find evidence for genuine chemical stratification in the Sunburst Arc, where a component enriched in nitrogen coexists with a chemically normal one. Finally, we argue that very-high-ionisation lines may be explained within a pure star-formation scenario invoking matter-bounded regions. However, in the case of RXCJ2248-ID, we cannot rule out a minor contribution from an AGN based solely on the observed fluxes. These results indicate that classical diagnostics can be significantly biased in high-redshift galaxies and that self-consistent, physically motivated tools are therefore essential to properly interpret the complex ISM conditions and chemical enrichment in the early Universe.

Reverberation mapping is one of the main techniques used to study active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. Traditional continuum reverberation mapping uses short lags between variability in different wavelength AGN light curves on the light crossing timescale of the disk to measure the radial structure of the disk. The harder-to-detect long negative lag measures lags on the longer inflow timescale, opening up a new window to mapping out the vertical structure of AGN disks. The Vera Rubin Observatory, with its 6 wavebands, long baseline, and high cadence, will revolutionize our ability to detect short and long lags. However, many challenges remain to detect these long lags, such as seasonal gaps in Rubin light curves, the weak signal strength of the long lag relative to the short lag, and the enormous influx of data for millions of AGN from Rubin. Machine learning techniques have the potential to solve many of these issues, but have yet to be applied to the long negative lag problem. We develop and train a transformer-based machine learning model to detect long and short lags in mock Rubin AGN light curves. Our model identifies whether a light curve in our test set has a long negative lag with 96% recall and 0.04% contamination, and is 98% accurate at predicting the true long lag. This accuracy is an enormous improvement over two baseline methods we test on the same mock light curves, the interpolated cross correlation function and javelin, which are only 54% and 21% accurate, respectively.
