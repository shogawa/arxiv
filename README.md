  Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star gets torn apart by a supermassive black hole as it crosses its tidal radius. We present late-time optical and X-ray observations of the nuclear transient AT2019qiz, which showed the typical signs of an optical-UV transient class commonly believed to be TDEs. Optical spectra were obtained 428, 481 and 828 rest-frame days after optical lightcurve peak, and a UV/X-ray observation coincided with the later spectrum. The optical spectra show strong coronal emission lines, including [Fe VII], [Fe X], [Fe XI] and [Fe XIV]. The Fe lines rise and then fall, except [Fe XIV] which appears late and rises. We observe increasing flux of narrow H-alpha and H-beta and a decrease in broad H-alpha flux. The coronal lines have FWHMs ranging from ~150 - 300km/s, suggesting they originate from a region between the broad and narrow line emitting gas. Between the optical flare and late-time observation, the X-ray spectrum softens dramatically. The 0.3-1 keV X-ray flux increases by a factor of ~50 while the hard X-ray flux decreases by a factor of ~6. WISE fluxes also rose over the same period, indicating the presence of an infrared echo. With AT2017gge, AT2019qiz is one of two examples of a spectroscopically-confirmed optical-UV TDE showing delayed coronal line emission, supporting speculations that Extreme Coronal Line Emitters in quiescent galaxies can be echos of unobserved past TDEs. We argue that the coronal lines, narrow lines, and infrared emission arise from the illumination of pre-existing material likely related to either a previous TDE or AGN activity.

  The extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission has finished the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS:1), and detected 10$^4$ galaxy clusters in the western Galactic hemisphere. In the radio band, the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope finished its pilot 1 phase of the project 'Evolutionary Map of the Universe' (EMU) with 220.000 sources in a 270 deg$^2$ field overlapping with eRASS:1. These two surveys are used to study radio-mode Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in clusters. In order to understand the efficiency of radio-mode feedback at the centers of galaxy clusters, we relate the radio properties of brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) to the X-ray properties of the host clusters. We identify the central radio sources in eRASS:1 clusters or calculate corresponding upper limits on the radio luminosity. Then, we derive relations between the X-ray properties of the clusters and the radio properties of the corresponding central radio source. We also apply a mid-infrared color criterion using WISE colors to identify AGN. In total we investigate a sample of 75 clusters. We find a statistically significant between the X-ray luminosity of the cluster and the 944 MHz radio luminosity of the corresponding central radio galaxy. There is also a positive trend between the radio power and the largest linear size (LLS) of the radio source. The density and the LLS do not show any correlation. We find that in high luminosity clusters with L_X &gt; $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ the kinetic luminosity of the radio jets is not longer correlated with the X-ray luminosity and discuss various reasons. We find an anti-correlation between the central cooling time t_cool and the radio luminosity L_R indicating a need for more powerful AGN in clusters with short central cooling times.

  The origin of the radio emission in radio-quiet quasars (RQQ) is not established yet. We present new VLBA observations at 1.6 and 4.9 GHz of ten RQQ (nine detected), which together with published earlier observations of eight RQQ (five detected), forms a representative sample of 18 RQQ drawn from the Palomar-Green sample of low z (&lt; 0.5) AGN. The spectral slope of the integrated emission extends from very steep (alpha &lt; -1.98) to strongly inverted (alpha = +2.18), and the slopes of nine of the 14 objects are flat (alpha &gt; -0.5). Most objects have an unresolved flat-spectrum core, which coincides with the optical Gaia position. The extended emission is generally steep-spectrum, has a low brightness temperature (&lt; 10^7 K), and is displaced from the optical core (the Gaia position) by ~ 5-100 pc. The VLBA core flux is tightly correlated with the X-ray flux, and follows a radio to X-ray luminosity relation of log L_R/L_X = -6, for all objects with a black hole mass log M_BH/M_Sun &lt; 8.5. The flatness of the core emission implies a compact source size (&lt; 0.1 pc), which likely originates from the accretion disk corona. The mas-scale extended emission is optically thin and of clumpy structure, and is likely produced by an outflow from the center. Radio observations at higher frequencies can further test the accretion disk coronal emission interpretation for the core emission in RQQ.

  Black hole driven outfBlack hole driven outflows in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) may interact with their interstellar medium (ISM) affecting star formation. Such feedback processes, reminiscent of those seen in massive galaxies, have been reported recently in some dwarf galaxies. However, such studies have usually been on kiloparsec and larger scales and our knowledge on the smallest spatial scales to which this feedback processes can operate is unclear. Here we demonstrate radio jet-ISM interaction on the scale of an asymmetric triple radio structure of $\sim$10 parsec size in NGC 4395. This triplet radio structure is seen in the 15 GHz continuum image and the two asymmetric jet like structures are situated on either side of the radio core that coincides with the optical {\it Gaia} position. The high resolution radio image and the extended [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission, indicative of an outflow, are spatially coincident and are consistent with the interpretation of a low power radio jet interacting with the ISM. Modelling of the spectral lines using CLOUDY and MAPPINGS, and estimation of temperature using Gemini and MaNGA integral field spectroscopic data suggest shock ionization of the gas. The continuum emission at 237 GHz, though weak was found to spatially coincide with the AGN, however, the CO(2-1) line emission was found to be displaced by around 1 arcsec northward of the AGN core. The spatial coincidence of molecular H2$\lambda$2.4085 along the jet direction, the morphology of ionised [OIII]$\lambda$5007 and displacement of CO(2-1) emission argues for conditions less favourable for star formation at $\sim$5 parsec.
