  Galaxy mergers represent a fundamental physical process under hierarchical structure formation, but their role in triggering AGNs is still unclear. We aim to investigate the merger-AGN connection using state-of-the-art observations and novel methods in detecting mergers and AGNs. We selected stellar mass-limited samples at redshift z&lt;1 from KiDS, focusing on the KiDS-N-W2 field with a wide range of multi-wavelength data. Three AGN types, selected in the MIR, X-ray, and via SED modelling, were analysed. To identify mergers, we used convolutional neural networks trained on two cosmological simulations. We created mass and redshift-matched control samples of non-mergers and non-AGNs. We observe a clear AGN excess (a factor of 2-3) in mergers with respect to non-mergers for the MIR AGNs, and a mild excess for the X-ray and SED AGNs, indicating that mergers could trigger all 3 types but are more connected with the MIR AGNs. About half of the MIR AGNs are in mergers but it is unclear whether mergers are the main trigger. For the X-ray and SED AGNs, mergers are unlikely to be the dominant trigger. We also explore the relation using the continuous AGN fraction $f_{AGN}$ parameter. Mergers exhibit a clear excess of high $f_{AGN}$ values relative to non-mergers, for all AGNs. We unveil the first merger fraction $f_{merg}-f_{AGN}$ relation with two distinct regimes. When the AGN is not dominant, the relation is only mildly increasing or even flat, with the MIR AGNs showing the highest $f_{merg}$. In the regime of very dominant AGNs ($f_{AGN}\geq0.8$), $f_{merg}$ shows a steeply rising trend with increasing $f_{AGN}$ for all AGN types. These trends are also seen when plotted against AGN bolometric luminosity. We conclude that mergers are most connected with dust-obscured AGNs (linked to a fast-growing phase of the SMBH) and are the main or even the sole fuelling mechanism of the most powerful AGNs.

  Small-scale winds driven from accretion discs surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGN) are expected to launch kpc-scale outflows into their host galaxies. However, the ways in which the structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) affects the multiphase content and impact of the outflow remains uncertain. We present a series of numerical experiments featuring a realistic small-scale AGN wind with velocity $5\times 10^3-10^4\ \rm{km/s}$ interacting with an isolated galaxy disc with a manually-controlled clumpy ISM, followed at sub-pc resolution. Our simulations are performed with AREPO and probe a wide range of AGN luminosities ($L=10^{43-47}\ \rm{erg/s}$) and ISM substructures. In homogeneous discs, the AGN wind sweeps up an outflowing, cooling shell, where the emerging cold phase dominates the mass and kinetic energy budgets, reaching a momentum flux $\dot{p} \approx 7\ L/c$. However, when the ISM is clumpy, outflow properties are profoundly different. They contain small, long-lived ($&gt; 5\ \rm{Myr}$), cold ($T&lt;10^{4.5}\ \rm{K}$) cloudlets entrained in the faster, hot outflow phase, which are only present in the outflow if radiative cooling is included in the simulation. While the cold phase dominates the mass of the outflow, most of the kinetic luminosity is now carried by a tenuous, hot phase with $T &gt; 10^7 \ \rm K$. While the hot phases reaches momentum fluxes $\dot{p} \approx (1 - 5)\ L/c$, energy-driven bubbles couple to the cold phase inefficiently, producing modest momentum fluxes $\dot{p} &lt; L/c$ in the fast-outflowing cold gas. These low momentum fluxes could lead to the outflows being misclassified as momentum-driven using common observational diagnostics. We also show predictions for scaling relations between outflow properties and AGN luminosity and discuss the challenges in constraining outflow driving mechanisms and kinetic coupling efficiencies using observed quantities.

  Low-luminosity AGNs with low-mass black holes (BHs) in the early universe are fundamental to understanding the BH growth and their co-evolution with the host galaxies. Utilizing JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we perform a systematic search for broad-line ${\rm H\alpha}$ emitters (BHAEs) at $z\approx 4-5$ in 25 fields of the ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era) project, covering a total area of 275 arcmin$^2$. We identify 16 BHAEs with FWHM of the broad components spanning from $\sim$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$ to 3000 km s$^{-1}$. Assuming the broad linewidths arise due to Doppler broadening around BHs, the implied BH masses range from $10^7$ to $10^{8}~M_\odot$, with broad ${\rm H\alpha}$-converted bolometric luminosity of $10^{44.5}-10^{45.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and Eddington ratios of $0.07-0.47$. The spatially extended structure of the F200W stacked image may trace the stellar light from the host galaxies. The ${\rm H\alpha}$ luminosity function indicates an increasing AGN fraction towards the higher ${\rm H\alpha}$ luminosities. We find possible evidence for clustering of BHAEs: two sources are at the same redshift with a projected separation of 519 kpc; one BHAE appears as a composite system residing in an overdense region with three close companion ${\rm H\alpha}$ emitters. Three BHAEs exhibit blueshifted absorption troughs indicative of the presence of high-column-density gas. We find the broad-line and photometrically selected BHAE samples exhibit different distributions in the optical continuum slopes, which can be attributed to their different selection methods. The ASPIRE broad-line ${\rm H\alpha}$ sample provides a good database for future studies of faint AGN populations at high redshift.

  Outflowing gas from supermassive black holes in the centers of active galaxies has been postulated as a major contributor to galactic evolution. To explore the interaction between narrow-line region (NLR) outflows and their host galaxies, we use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) images of 15 nearby (z &lt; 0.02) active galactic nuclei (AGN) to determine the extents and geometries of their NLRs. We combine new HST WFC3 continuum and [O III] $\lambda$5007A images of 11 AGN with 4 archival AGN to match existing spectra from HST STIS. For the 6 AGN with suitable long-slit coverage of their NLRs, we use isophotal fitting of ground-based images, continuum-subtracted [O III] images, and the STIS spectra, to resolve, measure, and de-project the gas kinematics to the plane of the host galaxy disk and distinguish NLR outflows from galaxy rotation and/or kinematically disturbed gas. We find an average [O III] extent of $\sim$680pc with a correlation between gas extent and [O III] luminosity of R$_\mathrm{[O III]}$ $\propto$ L$_{\text{[O III]}}^{0.39}$. The measured extents depend strongly on the depth of the [O III] images, highlighting the importance of adopting uniform thresholds when analyzing scaling relationships. The outflows reach from 39-88% of the full NLR extents, and we find that all 6 of the AGN with STIS coverage of their entire NLRs show strong kinematic evidence for outflows, despite previous uncertainty for these AGN. This suggests that NLR outflows are ubiquitous in moderate luminosity AGN and that standard criteria for kinematic modeling are essential for identifying outflows.

  We present the BoRG-JWST survey, a combination of two JWST Cycle 1 programs aimed at obtaining NIRSpec spectroscopy of representative, UV-bright $7&lt;z&lt;10$ galaxy candidates across 22 independent sight lines selected from Hubble/WFC3 pure-parallel observations. We confirm the high-$z$ nature of 10 out of 19 observed primary targets through low-resolution prism observations, with the rest revealing themselves unsurprisingly to be $z\sim1-3$ interlopers, brown dwarfs, or yielding inconclusive results. From the MSA observations, we confirm an additional 9 filler sources at $z&gt;5$, highlighting the large abundance of high-redshift galaxies even in individual WFC3 pointings. The primary sample span an absolute magnitude range $-20.4&lt;M_{\rm UV}&lt;-22.4$ mag and harbour UV continuum slopes of $\beta\simeq-2.5$ to $-2.0$, representing some of the most luminous $z&gt;7$ sources currently known and comparable to the brightest sources at $z&gt;10$. Prominent [O III]+H$\beta$ lines are found across the full sample, while a stack of sources reveals a plethora of other rest-optical lines and additional rest-UV C III]1909 \r{A} emission. Despite their luminosities, none of the low-resolution spectra display evidence for Type 1 AGN activity based on a search for broad-line emission. Lastly, we present a spectroscopic data release of 188 confirmed $0.5\lesssim z\lesssim5.0$ sources from filler MSA observations, highlighting the legacy value of the survey and a representative benchmark for comparisons to deep field observations.

  Star formation rate (SFR) is a fundamental parameter for describing galaxies and inferring their evolutionary course. HII regions yield the best measure of instantaneous SFR in galaxies, although the derived SFR can have large uncertainties depending on tracers and assumptions. We present an SFR calibration for the entire molecular gas disk of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, based on our new high-sensitivity ALMA 100GHz continuum data at 55pc (=0."8) resolution in combination with the HST Pa{\alpha} line data. In this calibration, we account for the spatial variations of dust extinction, electron temperature of HII regions, AGN contamination, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) based on publicly available multi-wavelength data. Especially, given the extended nature and the possible non-negligible contribution to the total SFR, a careful consideration of DIG is essential. With a cross-calibration between two corrected ionized gas tracers (free-free continuum&amp;Pa{\alpha}), the total SFR of the NGC 1068 disk is estimated to be 3.2\pm0.5 Msol/yr, one-third of the SFR without accounting for DIG (9.1\pm1.4 Msol/yr). We confirmed high SFR around the southern bar-end and the corotation radius, which is consistent with the previous SFR measurements. In addition, our total SFR exceeds the total SFR based on 8{\mu}m dust emission by a factor of 1.5. We attribute this discrepancy to the differences in the young stars at different stages of evolution traced by each tracer and their respective timescales. This study provides an example to address the various uncertainties in conventional SFR measurements and their potential to lead to significant SFR miscalculations.
