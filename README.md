  We present the results of the single-dish observations using the Korean VLBI Network to search for anomalous microwave emission (AME) in nearby galaxies. The targets were selected from MApping the dense moLecular gAs in the sTrongest stAr-formiNg Galaxies (MALATANG), a legacy survey project of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The MALATANG galaxies are good representatives of local galaxies with enhanced nuclear activity associated with star formation and/or AGN, providing IR-bright galaxy samples; thus, they are good candidates for AME hosts. Combining with the ancillary data, we investigated the radio-IR spectral energy distribution (SED), while searching for the AME signals in five galaxies. The AME in NGC 2903 was well detected at a significant confidence level, whereas that in NGC 2146 and M82 was marginal. NGC 1068 and Arp 299 indicated no significant hints, and we provided the upper limits for the AME. The best-fit SED exhibited local peaks of the AME components at higher frequencies and with stronger peak fluxes than those in the previous studies. This suggested the origin of AME being denser environments such as molecular clouds or photodissociation regions rather than warm neutral/ionized medium as commonly suggested by previous studies. Further, our AME-detected targets were observed to exhibit higher specific star-formation rates than the other extragalactic AME hosts. Furthermore, AME favored starburst galaxies among our sample rather than AGN hosts. Consequently, this might imply that AGNs are excessively harsh environments for tiny dust to survive.

  Study of high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) can shed light on the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) evolution in massive elliptical galaxies. The vast majority of observed high-redshift AGNs are quasars, and there are very few radio galaxies at redshifts $z&gt;3$. We present the radio properties of 173 sources optically identified with radio galaxies at $z\geqslant1$ with flux densities $S_{1.4}\geqslant20$ mJy. Literature data were collected for compilation of broadband radio spectra, estimation of radio variability, radio luminosity, and radio loudness. Almost 60% of the galaxies have steep or ultra-steep radio spectra; 22% have flat, inverted, upturn, and complex spectral shapes, and 18% have peaked spectra (PS). The majority of the PS sources in the sample (20/31) are megahertz-peaked spectrum sources candidates, i.e. possibly very young and compact radio galaxies. The median values of the variability indices at 11 and 5 GHz are $V_{S_{11}}=0.14$ and $V_{S_{5}}=0.13$, which generally indicates a weak or moderate character of the long-term variability of the studied galaxies. The typical radio luminosity and radio loudness are $L_{5}=10^{43}$ - $10^{44}$ erg*s$^{-1}$ and $\log R=3$ - $4$ respectively. We have found less prominent features of the bright compact radio cores for our sample compared to high-redshift quasars at $z\geq3$. The variety of the obtained radio properties shows the different conditions for the formation of radio emission sources in galaxies.

  We have used the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) aboard AstroSat to study star formation in a sample of nine dual nuclei galaxies with separations ~11 kpc, which is an expected outcome of galaxy mergers. To minimize the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) emission, we have used mid-IR color cut-offs and masked the AGN-dominated nuclei. The UV continuum slope ($\beta$) is used to calculate the internal extinction (A$_V$) which ranges from 0.53 to 4.04 in the FUV band and 0.44 to 3.10 in the NUV band for the sample. We have detected $1-20$ star-forming clumps (SFCs) in our sample galaxies. The extinction-corrected total FUV star-formation rate (SFR) ranges from $\sim$0.35 to $\sim$32 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Our analyses of A$_V$, specific SFR (sSFR) show that dual nuclei sources are associated with dusty, star-forming galaxies. The FUV$-$NUV color maps show redder color in the nuclear and disk regions while bluer color is observed in the outskirts of most galaxies which can be due to embedded dust or different stellar populations. We have found some signatures of possible stellar/AGN feedback like a ring of star formation, a redder ring around blue nuclei, etc. However, further observations are required to confirm this.
