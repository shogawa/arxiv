  The radial distribution of gas within galactic haloes is connected to the star formation rate and the nature of baryon-driven feedback processes. Using six variants of the hydrodynamic simulation Simba, we study the impact of different stellar/AGN feedback prescriptions on the gas density profiles of haloes in the total mass range $10^{11} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\mathrm{200c}} &lt; 10^{14} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. We find that the radial profiles are well represented by a power law and that, for a fixed total halo mass, the slope and amplitude of such power law are generally weakly dependent on redshift. Once AGN-driven jets are activated in the simulation, the gas density profile of haloes with $M_{\rm 200c} \gtrsim 10^{13} \, \rm M_{\odot}$ declines more gently with radial distance. We argue that this distinctive feature could be exploited with current observations to discriminate amongst the predictions of the different feedback models. We introduce a universal fitting formula for the slope and amplitude of the gas density profile as a function of total halo mass and redshift. The best-fit functions are suitable for all feedback variants considered, and their predictions are in excellent agreement with the numerical results. We provide the values of all fit parameters, making our fitting formula a versatile tool to mimic the effect of Simba feedback models onto N-body simulations and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. Our results can also aid observational estimates of the gas mass within haloes that assume a specific slope for the underlying gas density profile.

  We report the discovery of the Fe K line emission at $\sim6.62^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ keV with a width of $\sim0.19^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ keV using two epochs of {\it Chandra} archival data from the nucleus of the galaxy 4C+37.11, which is known to host a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH) system where the SMBHs are separated by $\sim7$ mas or $\sim$ 7pc. Our study reports the first detection of the Fe K line from a known binary AGN, and has an F-statistic value of 20.98 and probability $2.47\times 10^{-12}$. Stacking of two spectra reveals another Fe K line component at $\sim7.87^{+0.19}_{-0.09}$ keV. Different model scenarios indicate that the lines originate from the combined effects of accretion disk emission and circumnuclear collisionally ionized medium. The observed low column density favors the gas-poor merger scenario, where the high temperature of the hot ionized medium may be associated with the shocked gas in the binary merger and not with star formation activity. The estimated total BSMBH mass and disk inclination are $\sim1.5\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and $\gtrsim75^\circ$, indicating that the BSMBH is probably a high inclination system. The spin parameter could not be tightly constrained from the present data sets. Our results draw attention to the fact that detecting the Fe K line emissions from BSMBHs is important for estimating the individual SMBH masses, and the spins of the binary SMBHs, as well as exploring their emission regions.

  We analyze JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the infrared PAH bands in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of local AGN from the GATOS Survey. In this work, we examine the PAH properties in the circumnuclear regions of AGN and AGN-outflows, and compare them to those in star-forming regions and the innermost regions of AGN. This study employs 4.9-28.1 micron sub-arcsecond angular resolution data to investigate the properties of PAH in three nearby sources (DL~30-40 Mpc). Our findings align with previous JWST studies, showing that the central regions of AGN show a larger fraction of neutral PAH molecules (i.e. elevated 11.3/6.2 and 11.3/7.7 PAH ratios) compared to star-forming galaxies. We find that the AGN might affect not only the PAH population in the innermost region but also in the extended regions up to ~kpc scales. By comparing our observations to PAH diagnostic diagrams, we find that, in general, regions located in the projected direction of the AGN-outflow occupy similar positions on the PAH diagnostic diagrams as those of the innermost regions of AGN. Star-forming regions that are not affected by the AGN in these galaxies share the same part of the diagram as Star-forming galaxies. We examine the potential of the PAH-H2 diagram to disentangle AGN versus star-forming activity. Our results suggest that in Sy-like AGN, illumination and feedback from the AGN might affect the PAH population at nuclear and kpc scales, in particular, the ionization state of the PAH grains. However, PAH sizes are rather similar. The carriers of the ionized PAH bands (6.2 and 7.7 micron) are less resilience than those of neutral PAH bands (11.3 micron), which might be particularly important for strongly AGN-host coupled systems. Therefore, caution must be applied when using PAH bands as star-formation rate indicators in these systems even at kpc scales, with the ionized ones being more affected by the AGN.

  Stellar mass black holes in the disks around active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising sources for gravitational wave detections by LIGO/VIRGO. Recent studies suggest this environment fosters the formation and merger of binary black holes. Many of these studies often assumed a simple, laminar AGN disk without magnetic fields or turbulence. In this work, we present the first 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of circum-single disks around isolated and binary black holes in strongly magnetized, stratified accretion disks with turbulence driven by magneto-rotational instability. We simulated three scenarios with varying initial net-vertical magnetic field strengths: weak, intermediate, and strong. Our results show that weakly magnetized models produce circum-single disks aligned with the AGN disk's equatorial plane, similar to past hydrodynamic simulations. However, intermediate and strong magnetic fields result in randomly misaligned disks, contingent upon the availability of local ambient angular momentum within turbulent regions. Our findings emphasize the significant impact of ambient gas in the AGN disk on the inclination of circum-single disks, linked to magnetically induced inhomogeneity and angular momentum during disk formation. The presence of misaligned disks, both in single and binary black hole systems, could have profound implications for the long-term evolution of black hole spin and the inclination of the disk at the horizon scale.

  We show that there exist two qualitatively different turbulent states of the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box. The first, which has been studied in detail previously, is characterized by a weakly magnetized ($\beta\sim50$) midplane with slow periodic reversals of the mean azimuthal field (dynamo cycles). The second (the "low-$\beta$ state"), which is the main subject of this paper, is characterized by a strongly magnetized $\beta\sim1$ midplane dominated by a coherent azimuthal field with much stronger turbulence and much larger accretion stress $\alpha \sim 1$. The low-$\beta$ state is realized in simulations that begin with sufficiently strong azimuthal magnetic fields. The mean azimuthal field in the low-$\beta$ state is quasi steady (no cycles) and is sustained by a dynamo mechanism that compensates for the continued loss of magnetic flux through the vertical boundaries; we attribute the dynamo to the combination of differential rotation and the Parker instability, although many of its details remain unclear. Vertical force balance in the low-$\beta$ state is dominated by the mean magnetic pressure except at the midplane, where thermal pressure support is always important (this is true even when simulations are initialized at $\beta\ll1$, provided the thermal scale-height of the disk is well-resolved). The efficient angular momentum transport in the low-$\beta$ state may resolve long-standing tension between predictions of magnetorotational turbulence (at high $\beta$) and observations; likewise, the bifurcation in accretion states we find may be important for understanding the state transitions observed in dwarf novae, X-ray binaries, and changing-look AGN. We discuss directions for future work including the implications of our results for global accretion disk simulations.

  detectable shadows

  Sub-parsec supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries are expected to be common in active galactic nuclei (AGN), as a result of the hierarchical build-up of galaxies via mergers. While direct evidence for these compact binaries is lacking, a few hundred candidates have been identified, most based on the apparent periodicities of their optical light-curves. Since these signatures can be mimicked by AGN red-noise, additional evidence is needed to confirm their binary nature. Recurring self-lensing flares (SLF), occurring whenever the two BHs are aligned with the line of sight within their Einstein radii, have been suggested as additional binary signatures. Furthermore, in many cases, lensing flares are also predicted to contain a "dip", whenever the lensed SMBH's shadow is comparable in angular size to the binary's Einstein radius. This feature would unambiguously confirm binaries and additionally identify SMBH shadows that are spatially unresolvable by high-resolution VLBI. Here we estimate the number of quasars for which these dips may be detectable by LSST, by extrapolating the quasar luminosity function to faint magnitudes, and assuming that SMBH binaries are randomly oriented and have mass-ratios following those in the Illustris simulations. Under plausible assumptions about quasar lifetimes, binary fractions, and Eddington ratios, we expect tens of thousands of detectable flares, of which several dozen contain measurable dips.

  The ability to accurately discern active massive black holes (BHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies is paramount to understanding the origins and processes of "seed" BHs in the early Universe. We present Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of a sample of three local dwarf galaxies (M$_{*}$ $\leqslant 3 \times 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$, z $\leqslant$ 0.15) previously identified as candidates for hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). The galaxies were selected from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) with spatially coincident X-ray detections in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS). Our new Chandra data reveal three X-ray point sources in two of the target galaxies with luminosities between log(L$_{\rm \text{2-10 keV}}$ [erg s$^{-1}$]) = 39.1 and 40.4. Our results support the presence of an AGN in these two galaxies and a ULX in one of them. For the AGNs, we estimate BH masses of $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5-6} M_\odot$ and Eddington ratios on the order of $\sim 10^{-3}$.
