  The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) cosmology survey includes a Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) which will yield spectra for over ten million bright galaxies (r&lt;20.2 AB mag). The resulting sample will be valuable for both cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, the star/galaxy separation criterion implemented in the nominal BGS target selection algorithm excludes quasar host galaxies in addition to bona fide stars. While this excluded population is comparatively rare (~3-4 per square degrees), it may hold interesting clues regarding galaxy and quasar physics. Therefore, we present a target selection strategy that was implemented to recover these missing active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the BGS sample. The design of the selection criteria was both motivated and confirmed using spectroscopy. The resulting BGS-AGN sample is uniformly distributed over the entire DESI footprint. According to DESI survey validation data, the sample comprises 93% quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), 3% narrow-line AGN or blazars with a galaxy contamination rate of 2% and a stellar contamination rate of 2%. Peaking around redshift z=0.5, the BGS-AGN sample is intermediary between quasars from the rest of the BGS and those from the DESI QSO sample in terms of redshifts and AGN luminosities. The stacked spectrum is nearly identical to that of the DESI QSO targets, confirming that the sample is dominated by quasars. We highlight interesting small populations reaching z&gt;2 which are either faint quasars with nearby projected companions or very bright quasars with strong absorption features including the Lyman-apha forest, metal absorbers and/or broad absorption lines.

  We present a sample of 341 "little red dots" (LRDs) spanning the redshift range $z\sim2-11$ using data from the CEERS, PRIMER, JADES, UNCOVER and NGDEEP surveys. These sources are likely heavily-reddened AGN that trace a previously-hidden phase of dust-obscured black hole growth in the early Universe. Unlike past use of color indices to identify LRDs, we employ continuum slope fitting using shifting bandpasses to sample the same rest-frame emission blueward and redward of the Balmer break. This approach allows us to identify LRDs over a wider redshift range and is less susceptible to contamination from galaxies with strong breaks that otherwise lack a rising red continuum. The redshift distribution of our sample increases at $z&lt;8$ and then undergoes a rapid decline at $z\sim4.5$, which may tie the emergence, and obscuration, of these sources to the inside-out growth that galaxies experience during this epoch. We find that LRDs are 2-3 dex more numerous than bright quasars at $z\sim5-7$, but their number density is only 0.6-1 dex higher than X-ray and UV selected AGN at these redshifts. Within our sample, we have identified the first X-ray detected LRDs at $z=3.1$ and $z=4.66$. An X-ray spectral analysis confirms that these AGN are moderately obscured with $\log\,(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{2}$) of $23.3^{+0.4}_{-1.3}$ and $22.72^{+0.13}_{-0.16}$. Our analysis reveals that reddened AGN emission dominates their rest-optical light, while the rest-UV originates from their host galaxies. We also present NIRSpec follow-up spectroscopy of 17 LRDs that show broad emission lines consistent with AGN activity. The confirmed AGN fraction of our sample is $71\%$ for sources with F444W$&lt;26.5$. In addition, we find three LRDs with narrow blue-shifted Balmer absorption features in their spectra, suggesting an outflow of high-density, low ionization gas from near the central engine of these faint, red AGN.

  The soft excess in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may arise through a combination of relativistic reflection and the effects of a warm corona at the surface of the accretion disc. Detailed examination of the soft excess can therefore constrain models of the transport and dissipation of accretion energy. Here, we analyze 34 XMM-Newton observations from 14 Type I AGNs with the reXcor spectral model which self-consistently combines emission from a warm corona with relativistic reflection assuming a lamppost corona. The model divides accretion energy between the disc, the warm corona, and the lamppost. The XMM-Newton observations span a factor of 188 in Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}$) and 350 in black hole mass, and we find that a warm corona is a significant contributor to the soft excess for 13 of the 14 AGNs with a mean warm corona heating fraction of $0.51$. The reXcor fits reveal that the fraction of accretion energy dissipated in the lamppost is anti-correlated with $\lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}$. In contrast, the relationship between $\lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}$ and both the optical depth and heating fraction of the warm corona appears to transition from an anti-correlation to a correlation at $\lambda_{\mathrm{obs,t}} \approx 0.15$. Therefore, at least one other physical process in addition to the accretion rate is needed to explain the evolution of the warm corona. Overall, we find that a warm corona appears to be a crucial depository of accretion energy in AGNs across a broad range of $\lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}$ and black hole mass.

  Galaxies are complex objects, yet the number of independent parameters to describe them remains unknown. We present here a non-parametric method to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of large datasets. We apply it to wide-band photometric data drawn from the COSMOS2020 catalogue and a comparable mock catalogue from the Horizon-AGN simulation. Our galaxy catalogues are limited in signal-to-noise ratio in all optical and NIR bands. Our results reveal that most of the variance in the wide-band photometry of this galaxy sample can be described with at most $4.3\pm0.5$ independent parameters for star-forming galaxies and $2.9\pm0.2$ for passive ones, both in the observed and simulated catalogues. We identify one of these parameters to be noise-driven, and recover that stellar mass and redshift are two key independent parameters driving the magnitudes. Our findings support the idea that wide-band photometry does not provide more than one additional independent parameter for star-forming galaxies. Although our sample is not mass-limited and may miss some passive galaxies due to our cut in SNR, our work suggests that dimensionality reduction techniques may be effectively used to explore and analyse wide-band photometric data, provided the used latent space is at least four-dimensional.

  In this work, we compare the SFRs and SFHs of AGN and non-AGN galaxies. We explore these aspects across different density fields and over three orders of magnitude in L$_X$. For that purpose, we employ X-ray AGN detected in the XMM-XXL field and construct a galaxy control sample, using sources from the VIPERS catalogue. Our final samples consist of 149 X-ray AGN with $\rm 42&lt;log,[L_{X,2-10keV}(ergs^{-1})]&lt;45$ and 3\,488 non-AGN systems. The sources span a redshift range of $\rm 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0$ and $10.5&lt;\rm log\,[M_*(M_\odot)]&lt;11.5$. For these systems, there are available measurements for their local densities and their spectral lines from the VIPERS catalogue. To compare the SFR of these two populations, we calculate the SFR$_{norm}$ parameter. The latter is defined as the ratio of the SFR of AGN to the SFR of non-AGN galaxies with similar M$_*$ and redshift. Our findings reveal that low and moderate L$_X$ AGN that live in low density fields have a nearly flat SFR$_{norm}-$L$_X$ relation. In contrast, AGN of similar L$_X$ that live in high density environments present an increase of SFR$_{norm}$ with L$_X$. Notably, our results suggest that the most luminous of the AGN exhibit increased SFR relative to non-AGN galaxies, and this trend appears to be independent of the density of the environment. Furthermore, for AGN with similar L$_X$, those in high-density regions tend to have higher SFR$_{norm}$ values compared to their counterparts in low-density areas. Comparison of the D$_n$4000 spectral index, which serves as a proxy for the age of the stellar population, reveals that low-to-moderate L$_X$ AGN live in galaxies with comparable stellar populations with non-AGN systems, regardless of the density field they live in. However, the most luminous X-ray sources tend to live in galaxies that have younger stellar populations than non-AGN galaxies, regardless of the galaxy's environment.

  We present 6-GHz Very Large Array radio images of 70 gravitational lens systems at 300-mas resolution, in which the source is an optically-selected quasar, and nearly all of which have two lensed images. We find that about in half of the systems (40/70, with 33/70 secure), one or more lensed images are detected down to our detection limit of 20microJy/beam, similar to previous investigations and reinforcing the conclusion that typical optically-selected quasars have intrinsic GHz radio flux densities of a few microJy ($\sim10^{23}$WHz$^{-1}$ at redshifts of 1--2). In addition, for ten cases it is likely that the lensing galaxies are detected in the radio. Available detections of, and limits on the far-infrared luminosities from the literature, suggest that nearly all of the sample lie on the radio-FIR correlation typical of star-forming galaxies, and that their radio luminosities are at least compatible with the radio emission being produced by star formation processes. One object, WISE2329$-$1258, has an extra radio component that is not present in optical images, and is difficult to explain using simple lens models. In-band spectral indices, where these can be determined, are generally moderately steep and consistent with synchrotron processes either from star-formation/supernovae or AGN. Comparison of the A/B image flux ratios at radio and optical wavelengths suggests a 10 per cent level contribution from finite source effects or optical extinction to the optical flux ratios, together with sporadic larger discrepancies that are likely to be due to optical microlensing.
