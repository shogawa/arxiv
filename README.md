  The recent binary black hole (BBH) merger GW231123 consisted of the merger of two intermediate mass black holes (IMBH) which appear to have large spin magnitudes. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are very promising environments for IMBH mergers and growth due to high escape velocities. Here we demonstrate how GW231123 can be produced in the AGN channel. Using the McFACTS code, we explore the impact of various choices of the black hole (BH) initial mass function (IMF) on predicted mass and spin magnitudes of BBH mergers from the AGN dynamical formation channel. By integrating the likelihood function for GW231123 with the detectable BBH population predicted from AGN using McFACTS, we demonstrate that GW231123 is consistent with a dynamical BBH merger from the AGN channel. We also postulate that the masses and spin magnitudes of GW231123 are most consistent with a merger of fourth and third generation BHs, for most choices of a segregated BH IMF and AGN lifetime.

  We present SPARCS, which combines the moment-based radiative transfer method SPH-M1RT with the non-equilibrium metal chemistry solver CHIMES in the modern highly-parallel astrophysical code SWIFT. SPARCS enables on-the-fly radiation hydrodynamics simulations, with multi-frequency ultraviolet radiative transfer coupled with all ionisation states of 11 major elements, in the presence of dust, cosmic ray ionization and heating, and self-gravity. Direct radiation pressure on gas and dust is also accounted for. We validate SPARCS against analytic solutions and standard photo-ionization codes such as CLOUDY in idealized tests. As an example application, we simulate an ionization front propagating through an inhomogeneous interstellar medium with solar metallicity. We produce mock optical emission line observations with the level population calculation code HyLight and the diagnostic radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that non-equilibrium effects and inhomogeneities can boost the low ion fractions by up to an order of magnitude. Possible applications of SPARCS include studying the dynamical impact of radiation on gas in star-forming regions, and in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium, as well as interpreting line diagnostics in such environments, and galactic or AGN outflows.
