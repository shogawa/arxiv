  A surprising finding of recent studies is the large number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) associated with moderately massive black holes ($\rm \log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)\sim 6-8$), in the first billion years after the Big Bang ($z&gt;5$). In this context, a relevant finding has been the large fraction of candidate dual AGN, both at large separations (several kpc) and in close pairs (less than a kpc), likely in the process of merging. Frequent black hole merging may be a route for black hole growth in the early Universe; however, previous findings are still tentative and indirect. We present JWST/NIRSpec-IFU observations of a galaxy at $z=7.15$ in which we find evidence for a $\rm \log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)\sim7.7$ accreting black hole, as traced by a broad component of H$\beta$ emission, associated with the Broad Line Region (BLR) around the black hole. This BLR is offset by 620 pc in projection from the centroid of strong rest-frame optical emission, with a velocity offset of $\sim$40 km/s. The latter region is also characterized by (narrow) nebular emission features typical of AGN, hence also likely hosting another accreting black hole, although obscured (type 2, narrow-line AGN). We exclude that the offset BLR is associated with Supernovae or massive stars, and we interpret these results as two black holes in the process of merging. This finding may be relevant for estimates of the rate and properties of gravitational wave signals from the early Universe that will be detected by future observatories like LISA.

  We perform a systematic, multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of X-ray detected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at $z=0.2-0.8$ with SDSS counterparts in the Stripe 82 region, consisting of 60 type-1 and 137 type-2 AGNs covering a 2--10 keV luminosity range of $41.6 &lt; {\rm log}\ L_{\rm x} &lt; 44.7$. The latest CIGALE code, where dusty polar components are included, is employed. To obtain reliable host and AGN parameters in type-1 AGNs, we utilize the image decomposed optical SED of host galaxies by Li et al. (2021) based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images. The mean ratio of black hole masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) and stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}$) of our X-ray detected type-1 AGN sample, $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm stellar}) = -2.7\pm0.5$, is close to the local relation between black hole and stellar masses, as reported by Li et al. (2021) for SDSS quasars. This ratio is slightly lower than that found for more luminous ($\log L_{\rm bol} &gt; 45$) type-1 AGNs at $z\sim1.5$. This can be explained by the AGN-luminosity dependence of $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm stellar})$, which little evolves with redshift. We confirm the trend that the UV-to-X-ray slope ($\alpha_{\rm OX}$) or X-ray-to-bolometric correction factor ($\kappa_{2-10}$) increases with AGN luminosity or Eddington ratio. We find that type-1 and type-2 AGNs with the same luminosity ranges share similar host stellar-mass distributions, whereas type-2s tend to show smaller AGN luminosities than type-1s. This supports the luminosity (or Eddington ratio) dependent unified scheme.

  We present a new physically-motivated model for estimating the molecular line emission in active galaxies. The model takes into account (i) the internal density structure of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), (ii) the heating associated both to stars and to the active galactic nuclei (AGN), respectively producing photodissociation regions (PDRs) and X-ray dominated regions (XDRs) within the GMCs, and (iii) the mass distribution of GMCs within the galaxy volume. The model needs, as input parameters, the radial profiles of molecular mass, far-UV flux and X-ray flux for a given galaxy, and it has two free parameters: the CO-to-H2 conversion factor $\alpha_{CO}$, and the X-ray attenuation column density $N_H$. We test this model on a sample of 24 local ($z \leq 0.06$) AGN-host galaxies, simulating their carbon monoxide spectral line energy distribution (CO SLED). We compare the results with the available observations and calculate, for each galaxy, the best ($\alpha_{CO}$, $N_H$) with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, finding values consistent with those present in the literature. We find a median $\alpha_{CO} = 4.8$ M$_{\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$)$^{-1}$ for our sample. In all the modelled galaxies, we find the XDR component of the CO SLED to dominate the CO luminosity from $J_{\text{upp}} \geq 4$. We conclude that, once a detailed distribution of molecular gas density is taken into account, PDR emission at mid-/high-$J$ becomes negligible with respect to XDR.
