  The Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) survey program was designed specifically to include Near Infrared Slitless Spectroscopic observations (\NGDEEP) to detect multiple emission lines in as many galaxies as possible and across a wide redshift range using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS). To date, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed 50$\%$ of the allocated orbits (Epoch 1) of this program (\NGDEEPA). Using a set of independently developed calibration files designed to deal with a complex combination of overlapping spectra, multiple position angles, and multiple cross filters and grisms, in conjunction with a robust and proven algorithm for quantifying contamination from overlapping dispersed spectra, \NGDEEPA\ has achieved a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity limit of 2 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$. We demonstrate the power of deep wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) to characterize the dust content, star-formation rates, and metallicity ([OIII]/H$\beta$) of galaxies at $1&lt;z&lt;3.5$. Further, we identify the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and infer the mass of their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using broadened restframe MgII and H$\beta$ emission lines. The spectroscopic results are then compared with the physical properties of galaxies extrapolated from fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to photometry alone. The results clearly demonstrate the unique power and efficiency of WFSS at near-infrared wavelengths over other methods to determine the properties of galaxies across a broad range of redshifts.

  We present the first results from "Surveying the Whirlpool at Arcseconds with NOEMA" (SWAN), an IRAM Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA)+30m large program that maps emission from several molecular lines at 90 and 110 GHz in the iconic nearby grand-design spiral galaxy M~51 at cloud-scale resolution ($\sim$3\arcsec=125\,pc). As part of this work, we have obtained the first sensitive cloud-scale map of N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) of the inner $\sim5\,\times 7\,$kpc of a normal star-forming galaxy, which we compare to HCN(1-0) and CO(1-0) emission to test their ability in tracing dense, star-forming gas. The average N$_2$H$^+$-to-HCN line ratio of our total FoV is $0.20\pm0.09$, with strong regional variations of a factor of $\gtrsim 2$ throughout the disk, including the south-western spiral arm and the center. The central $\sim1\,$kpc exhibits elevated HCN emission compared to N$_2$H$^+$, probably caused by AGN-driven excitation effects. We find that HCN and N$_2$H$^+$ are strongly super-linearily correlated in intensity ($\rho_\mathrm{Sp}\sim 0.8$), with an average scatter of $\sim0.14\,$dex over a span of $\gtrsim 1.5\,$dex in intensity. When excluding the central region, the data is best described by a power-law of exponent $1.2$, indicating that there is more N$_2$H$^+$ per unit HCN in brighter regions. Our observations demonstrate that the HCN-to-CO line ratio is a sensitive tracer of gas density in agreement with findings of recent Galactic studies which utilize N$_2$H$^+$. The peculiar line ratios present near the AGN and the scatter of the power-law fit in the disk suggest that in addition to a first-order correlation with gas density, second-order physics (such as optical depth, gas temperature) or chemistry (abundance variations) are encoded in the N$_2$H$^+$/CO, HCN/CO and N$_2$H$^+$/HCN ratios.

  We present new high-sensitivity e-MERLIN and VLA radio images of the prototypical Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 at 5, 10 and 21 GHz. We image the radio jet, from the compact components NE, C, S1 and S2 to the faint double-lobed jet structure of the NE and SW jet lobes. Furthermore, we map the jet between by combining e-MERLIN and VLA data for the first time. Components NE, C and S2 have steep spectra indicative of optically-thin non-thermal emission domination between 5 and 21 GHz. Component S1, which is where the AGN resides, has a flat radio spectrum. We report a new component, S2a, a part of the southern jet. We compare these new data with the MERLIN and VLA data observed in 1983, 1992 and 1995 and report a flux decrease by a factor of 2 in component C, suggesting variability of this jet component. With the high angular resolution e-MERLIN maps, we detect the bow shocks in the NE jet lobe that coincide with the molecular gas outflows observed with ALMA. The NE jet lobe has enough radio power considered to be responsible for driving out the dense molecular gas observed with ALMA around the same region.

  Radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) are a unique AGN population and were thought to be preferentially associated with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at low accretion rates. They could impact the host galaxy evolution by expelling cold gas through the jet-mode feedback. In this work, we studied CO(6-5) line emission in a high-redshift radio galaxy, MRC 0152-209, at z=1.92 using ALMA up to a $0.024''$-resolution (corresponding to ~200 pc). This system is a starburst major merger constituted of two galaxies: the northwest (NW) one hosting the RLAGN with jet kinetic power $L_{\rm jet}\gtrsim2\times10^{46}$ erg/s and the southeast (SE) one. Based on the SED fitting for the entire system (NW+SE galaxies), we found AGN bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm AGN,bol}\sim0.9-3\times10^{46}$ erg/s for the RLAGN. We estimated BH mass through $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ scaling relations and found an Eddington ratio of $\sim0.7-4$ conservatively. These results suggest that the RLAGN is radiatively efficient and the powerful jets could be launched from a super-Eddington accretion disc. ALMA reveals a massive ($M_{\rm H_2}\sim2\times10^9$ Msun), compact ($\sim500$ pc), and lopsided molecular outflow perpendicular to the jet axis. The mass outflow rate (~1200-2600 Msun/yr) is comparable with the star formation rate of ~2000-3000 Msun/yr. The outflow kinetic power/$L_{\rm AGN,bol}$ ratio of ~0.008-0.02 and momentum boost factor ~3-24 agree with the radiative-mode AGN feedback. On the other hand, the jets can also drive the molecular outflow within its lifetime of $\sim2\times10^5$ yr without additional energy supply from AGN radiation. The jets then could remove all cold gas from the host galaxy through long-term, episodic launching. Our study reveals a unique object where starburst, powerful jets, and rapid BH growth co-exist, which may represent a fundamental stage of AGN-host galaxy co-evolution.

  Continuum reverberation mapping with high-cadence, long-term UV/optical monitoring of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) enables us to resolve the AGN central engine sizes on different timescales. The frequency-resolved time lags of NGC 5548 (the target for the AGN STORM I campaign) are inconsistent with the X-ray reprocessing of the classical Shakura $\&amp;$ Sunyaev disk model. Here we show that the frequency-resolved time lags in NGC 5548 can be well produced by the Corona-Heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model. Moreover, we make the CHAR model predictions of the frequency-resolved time lags for Mrk 817, the source of the AGN STORM II campaign. We also obtain the frequency-resolved time lags as a function of the black-hole mass and Eddington ratio, which is valid for black-hole masses from $10^{6.5}$ to $10^9\ M_{\odot}$, and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. Moreover, we demonstrate that, with the time spans of current continuum reverberation-mapping campaigns, the lag-luminosity relation of the CHAR model can be $\tau_{\mathrm{gz}}\propto L_{\mathrm{5100}}^{0.55\pm0.04}$, which is consistent with observations. Future observations can test our results and shed new light on resolving the AGN central engine.
