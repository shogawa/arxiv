  We present full 3-28 micron JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of $T_\mathrm{d} \gtrsim 500~\mathrm{K}$, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 micron, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C$_2$H$_2$, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature $T_\mathrm{rot} = 330~\mathrm{K}$, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 parsec core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. No evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.

  In this work we carry out an analysis of star-formation and nuclear activity in the different stages during a galaxy merger identified in isolated systems (isolated galaxies, isolated pairs, and isolated triplets) using integral field spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA project. We classify galaxies into close pairs, pre-mergers, mergers, and post-mergers (including galaxies with post-starburst spectroscopic features), for a total sample of 137 galaxies. We constrained their star formation history from spectro- photometric SED fitting with CIGALE, and used spatially resolved WHAN diagrams, with other MaNGA data products to explore if there is any connection of their physical properties with their merging stage. In general, galaxies show characteristic properties intrinsically related to each stage of the merger process. Galaxies in the merger and post-merger stages present higher star formation activity (measured by their integrated sSFR). In the merger stage, the fraction of strong AGN spaxels is comparable to the fraction of spaxels with pure star-formation emission, with no difference between AGN activity in close pairs and strongly interacting galaxies with the same stellar mass. Our results support the scenario where galaxy interactions trigger star-formation and nuclear activity on galaxies. Nonetheless, AGN has a minor role in quenching galaxies following a merger, as AGN feedback might not have had sufficient time to inhibit star formation. In addition, we found that the quenching process in post-mergers galaxies with post-starburst emission is happening outside-in, being an observational proof of the effect of interactions on the quenching process. The transforming processes after a recent major galaxy interaction may happen slowly on isolated environments, where the system evolves in a common dark matter halo without any perturbation of external galaxies.

  We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z &gt; 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 &lt; z &lt; 13. In our high-z (6 &lt; z &lt; 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2$\sigma$ with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.
