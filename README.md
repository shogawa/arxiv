  Dwarf AGN serve as the ideal systems for identifying intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) down to the most elusive regimes ($\sim 10^3 - 10^4 M_{\odot}$). However, the ubiquitously metal-poor nature of dwarf galaxies gives rise to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that can mimic the spectral signatures of IMBH excitation. We present a novel photoionization model suite that simultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming environment. We account for changes in $M_{BH}$ according to formation seeding channels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst age and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are insensitive to $M_{BH}$ and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and IMBHs. Many optical diagnostic diagrams cannot correctly identify dwarf AGN. The notable exceptions include He~II~$\lambda$4686 and [O~I]~$\lambda$6300, for which we redefine typical demarcations to account for ULX contributions. Emission lines in the mid-IR show the most promise in separating stellar, ULX, IMBH, and shock excitation while presenting sensitivity to $M_{BH}$ and $f_{\text{AGN}}$. Overall, our results expose the potential biases in identifying and characterizing dwarf AGN purely on strong line ratios and diagnostic diagrams rather than holistically evaluating the entire spectrum. As a proof of concept, we argue that recently discovered over-massive BHs in high-$z$ JWST AGN might not represent the overall BH population, with many galaxies in these samples potentially being falsely classified as purely star-forming.

  Stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) may form, evolve, and merge within the dense environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, thereby contributing to the BBH population detected by gravitational wave (GW) observatories. Mergers occurring in AGN disks may be gravitationally lensed by the supermassive black hole at the AGN centre. The probability of such lensing events has been approximately estimated by using the Einstein criterion in previous work. However, a more reasonable approach to calculating the lensing probability should be based on whether the detector can distinguish the lensed GW waveform from the unlensed one. In this work, we calculate the lensing probability of LIGO sources embedded in AGN disk by relating threshold mismatch to the signal-to-noise ratio of the observed events. For the sensitivity of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 observation runs, our results indicate that the lensing probability is several times higher than previous estimates. If AGNs are indeed the primary formation channel for BBHs, we could quantify the probability of detecting the lensed GW events in such a scenario. The non-detections, on the other hand, will place stricter constraints on the fraction of AGN disk BBHs and even the birthplaces of BBH mergers.

  JWST spectroscopy has built large emission line samples at $z\gtrsim4$, but it has yet to confidently reveal many galaxies with the hard radiation fields commonly associated with AGN photoionization. While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many $z&gt;4$ AGNs or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here we characterize the strength of high ionization lines in $53$ new galaxies observed with NIRSpec $R=2700$ grating spectroscopy. We present new detections of narrow NV$\lambda1240$ in two galaxies. One is a previously-confirmed $z=6.98$ Little Red Dot (LRD) with broad H$\beta$, and the other is a $z=8.72$ galaxy with a narrow line spectrum. Neither source exhibits CIV or HeII emission, indicating large NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high ionization lines in a large database of $851$ NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs ($12.5^{+23.7}_{-10.4}\%$) and UV-selected galaxies ($2.2^{+1.7}_{-1.0}\%$) at $z&gt;4$. The identification of narrow high ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios suggest that efforts to identify high ionization lines should extend down in wavelength to the NV doublet.

  We present CAPERS-LRD-z9, a little red dot (LRD) which we confirm to be a $z=9.288$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN). First identified as a high-redshift LRD candidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of CAPERS-LRD-z9 from the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) has revealed a broad $3500$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\beta$ emission line and narrow [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ lines, indicative of a BLAGN. Based on the broad H$\beta$ line, we compute a canonical black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})=7.58\pm0.15$, although full consideration of systematic uncertainties yields a conservative range of $6.65&lt;\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})&lt;8.50$. These observations suggest that either a massive black hole seed, or a lighter stellar remnant seed undergoing periods of super-Eddington accretion, is necessary to grow such a massive black hole in $\lesssim500$ Myr of cosmic time. CAPERS-LRD-z9 exhibits a strong Balmer break, consistent with a central AGN surrounded by dense ($\sim 10^{10}\textrm{ cm}^{-3}$) neutral gas. We model CAPERS-LRD-z9 using CLOUDY to fit the emission red-ward of the Balmer break with a dense gas-enshrouded AGN, and bagpipes to fit the rest-ultraviolet emission as a host-galaxy stellar population. This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy ($&lt;10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$) implies that the black-hole to stellar mass ratio may be extremely large, possibly $&gt;5\%$ (although systematic uncertainties on the black-hole mass prevent strong conclusions). However, the shape of the UV continuum differs from typical high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating that this UV emission may also be of AGN origin, and hence the true stellar mass of the host may be still lower.
