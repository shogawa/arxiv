  Aims. The central region of the Giant Low Surface Brightness galaxy Malin 1 has long been known to have a complex morphology with evidence of a bulge, disc, and potentially a bar hosting asymmetric star formation. In this work, we use VLT/MUSE data to resolve the central region of Malin 1 in order to determine its structure. Methods. We use careful light profile fitting in every image slice of the datacube to create wavelength-dependent models of each morphological component, from which we could cleanly extract their spectra. We then used the kinematics and emission line properties from these spectra to better understand the nature of each component extracted from our model fit. Results. We report the detection of a pair of distinct sources at the centre of this galaxy with a separation of ~1.05", which corresponds to a separation on sky of ~1.9 kpc. The radial velocity data of each object confirms that they both lie in the kinematic core of the galaxy, and analysis of the emission lines reveals that the central compact source is more consistent with being ionized by star formation and/or a LINER, while the off-centre compact source lies closer to the separation between star-forming galaxies and AGN. Conclusions. This evidence suggests that the centre of Malin 1 hosts either a bar with asymmetric star formation or two distinct components in which the off-centre compact source could either be a star-forming clump containing one or more star clusters that is in the process of falling into the core of the galaxy and which will eventually merge with the central NSC, or a clump of gas infalling into the centre of the galaxy from either outside or from the disc and triggering star formation there.

  Superbubbles in the nuclear region of galaxies could be produced by the AGN or nuclear starburst via different driving forces. We report analysis of the multi-wavelength data of the kpc-scale nuclear superbubble in NGC 3079, in order to probe the mechanisms driving the expansion of the superbubble. Based on the Chandra X-ray observations, we derive the hot gas thermal pressure inside the bubble, which is about one order of magnitude higher than that of the warm ionized gas traced by optical lines. We derive a [C II]-based star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}\sim1.3\rm~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ from the nuclear region using the SOFIA/FIFI-LS observation. This SFR infers a radiation pressure toward the bubble shells much lower than the thermal pressure of the gases. The VLA radio image infers a magnetic pressure at the northeast cap above the superbubble less than the thermal pressure of the hot gas enclosed in the bubble, but has a clearly larger extension. The magnetic field may thus still help to reconcile the expansion of the bubble. The observed thermal energy of the hot gas enclosed in the bubble requires an energy injection rate of $\gtrsim10^{42}\rm~ergs~s^{-1}$ within the bubble's dynamical age, which is probably larger than the power provided by the current nuclear starburst and the parsec-scale jet. If this is true, stronger past AGN activity may provide an alternative energy source to drive the observed bubble expansion.

  NGC 4945 contains a well-known heavily obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) at its core, with prior reports of strong nuclear and off-nuclear neutral Fe K$\alpha$ emission due to the AGN activity. We report the discovery of very extended Fe K$\alpha$ emission with the XMM-Newton EPIC pn in a $\sim5$ kpc by $\sim10$ kpc region that is misaligned with the plane of the inclined optical galaxy disk by $\sim60$ degrees in projection. After a careful consideration of the crowded center of the galaxy and numerous unresolved hard X-ray sources present, we estimate that $\sim15$% of the Fe K$\alpha$ is extended on kpc-sized scales. The overall size and misalignment of the region follows an unusual pattern of radio polarization that is not typical of starbursts or normal disk galaxies but has been interpreted as possibly due to AGN activity. We suggest that the extended Fe K$\alpha$ emission arose from a period of AGN eruption several million years ago - a relic of a past AGN ejection episode.
