  Adding to the RESOLVE and ECO Gas in Galaxy Groups (G3) initiative, we examine possible drivers of group-integrated HI-to-halo mass ratios ($M_{\rm HI,grp}/M_{\rm halo}$) and group X-ray emission, including group halo mass ($M_{\rm halo}$), virialization as probed by crossing time ($t_{\rm cross}$), presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and group-integrated fractional stellar mass growth rate (FSMGR$_{\rm grp}$). G3 groups span $M_{\rm halo}=10^{11-14.5}\,M_\odot$ with comprehensive HI and AGN information, which we combine with X-ray stacking of ROSAT All-Sky data. We detect hot gas emission exceeding AGN and X-ray binary backgrounds confidently for $M_{\rm halo}=10^{12.6-14}\,M_\odot$ and unambiguously for $M_{\rm halo}&gt;10^{14}\,M_\odot$, reflecting an inverse dependence of $M_{\rm\,HI,grp}/M_{\rm halo}$ and hot gas emission on halo mass. At fixed halo mass, $M_{\rm\,HI,grp}/M_{\rm halo}$ transitions to greater spread below $t_{\rm cross}\sim2$ Gyr. Dividing groups across this transition, lower-$t_{\rm cross}$ groups show elevated X-ray emission compared to higher-$t_{\rm cross}$ groups for $M_{\rm halo}&gt;10^{13.3}\,M_\odot$, but this trend reverses for $M_{\rm halo}=10^{12.6-13.3}\,M_\odot$. Additionally, AGN-hosting halos below $M_{\rm halo}\sim10^{12.1}\,M_\odot$ exhibit a broad, $\sim$0.25 dex deep valley in $M_{\rm HI,grp}/M_{\rm halo}$ compared to non-AGN-hosting halos with correspondingly reduced FSMGR$_{\rm grp}$. When diluted by non-AGN-hosting halos, this valley becomes shallower and narrower, falling roughly between $M_{\rm halo}=10^{11.5}\,M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm halo}=10^{12.1}\,M_\odot$ in the overall $M_{\rm\,HI,grp}/M_{\rm\,halo}$ vs. $M_{\rm halo}$ relation. We may also detect a second, less easily interpreted valley at $M_{\rm halo}\sim10^{13}\,M_\odot$. Neither valley matches theoretical predictions of a deeper valley at or above $M_{\rm halo}=10^{12.1}\,M_\odot$.

  We explore the effects of Bumblebee gravity on the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) using astrophysical sources modeled in the Unger-Farrar-Anchordoqui (UFA) framework (2015), which includes star formation rate (SFR), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We compute the density enhancement factor for various source separation distances ($d_\text{s}$s) up to 100 Mpc within the Bumblebee gravity scenario. Additionally, we calculate the CRs flux and their suppression, comparing the results with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and the Telescope Array through $\chi^2$ and $\chi_\text{red}^2$ analysis for the flux and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for suppression. The anisotropy in CRs arrival directions is examined, with corresponding $\chi^2$ and $\chi_\text{red}^2$ values obtained from the PAO surface detector data (SD 750 and SD 1500). Finally, we present skymaps of flux and anisotropy under different model assumptions, providing insights into the observational signatures of UHECRs in Bumblebee gravity. Our results show that increasing the Bumblebee gravity parameter $l$ enhances the density factor $\xi$, particularly at low energies, highlighting Lorentz violation's impact on CRs' propagation. Larger $d_\text{s}$ values amplify deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model, with AGN sources dominating at high energies and GRB/SFR sources at lower energies. The skymaps indicate the structured flux patterns at large $d_\text{s}$ and structured anisotropy at higher energies.

  Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass assembly across $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-10}, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We find significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at $z \sim 1-4$ and align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at $z=4-5$. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity evolution, except {\sc Dark Sage}, which predicts an excess deviating from models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced ``knee' in the bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by {\sc Dark Sage} around $L_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{46} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ is consistent with the inferred luminosity of ``Little Red Dots'' at $z=5-6$, assuming that their entire emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and accretion histories in {\sc Dark Sage}, which, unlike other models, allows for super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in {\sc Dark Sage} primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60\% of the total mass budget only for the most massive SMBHs by $z=0$.

  Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at $z=0.924$. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 ($\sim 30$ kpc) and [OIII]5007 ($\sim 20$ kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-$z$ AGNs, resembling a higher-$z$ analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the $2-6\times 10^{10} ~\rm M_{\odot}$ host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have $&lt;5\%$ luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of H$\beta$ line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent ($&lt;10^8$ yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN ($L_{\rm{bol}} \sim 1\times10^{42}$ erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.
