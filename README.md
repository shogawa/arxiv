  We investigate the role of the Simba feedback model on the structure of the Intra-Group Medium (IGrM) in the new Hyenas suite of cutting-edge cosmological zoom-in simulations. Using 34 high-resolution zooms of halos spanning from $10^{13}-10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ at $z=0.286$, we follow halos for 700 Myr, over several major active galactic nuclei (AGN) jet feedback events. We use the MOXHA package to generate mock Chandra X-ray observations, as well as predictive mocks for the upcoming LEM mission, identifying many feedback-generated features such as cavities, shock-fronts, and hot-spots, closely mimicking real observations. Our sample comprises $105$ snapshots with identified cavities, $50$ with single bubbles and $55$ with two, and spans three orders of magnitude in observed cavity enthalpies, from $10^{41}-10^{44}$ erg/s. Comparing semi-major axis length, midpoint radius, and eccentricity to a matched sample of observations, we find good agreement in cavity dimensions with real catalogues. We estimate cavity power from our mock maps following observational procedures, showing that this is typically more than enough to offset halo cooling, particularly in low-mass halos, where we match the observed excess in energy relative to cooling. Bubble enthalpy as measured with the usual midpoint pressure typically exceeds the energy released by the most recent jet event, hinting that the mechanical work is done predominantly at a lower pressure against the IGrM. We demonstrate for the first time that X-ray cavities are observable in a modern large-scale simulation suite and discuss the use of realistic cavity mock observations as new halo-scale constraints on feedback models in cosmological simulations.

  Making use of JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam data, we conduct a detailed analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric properties of GN-z8-LAE, a strong Lya emitter at z=8.279. Our goal is to investigate the interstellar medium (ISM) physical conditions that enable the Lya detection in this source at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and scrutinize GN-z8-LAE as an early reionizer. In broad agreement with previous results, we find that GN-z8-LAE is a young galaxy (age ~ 10 Myr) with a low stellar mass (M* ~ 10^7.66 Msun), significantly lower than those of most Lya emitters known at similarly high redshifts. The derived stellar mass and star formation rate surface densities are 355 Msun/pc^2 and 88 Msun/yr/kpc^2, respectively. Our spectral analysis indicates that: the Lya line peak has a small velocity offset 133+-72 km/s with respect to the galaxy systemic redshift; CIV] / CIII] ~ 3.3; the ISM is characterized by a hard ionization field, although no signature of AGN is present. Moreover, we report the presence of NIII]1750 emission with super-solar N abundance, which makes GN-z8-LAE one of the first known cases of a simultaneous strong Lya and nitrogen emitter at the EoR. Based on all these properties, we apply a wide range of methods to constrain the absolute Lyman continuum escape fraction of GN-z8-LAE, and find that it is &gt;14% in all cases. Therefore, we conclude that GN-z8-LAE is a robust candidate for a Lyman continuum (LyC) leaker at the EoR which is being caught at the moment of efficiently reionizing its surrounding medium.

  We present a catalog of optical and infrared identifications (ID) of X-ray sources in the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Deep field detected with Chandra covering $\sim 0.34\,{\rm deg^{2}}$ with 0.5-2 keV flux limits ranging $\sim 2 \mathrm{-} 20\times 10^{-16}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The optical/near-infrared counterparts of the X-ray sources are taken from our Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC)/Subaru and Wide-Field InfraRed Camera (WIRCam)/Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) data because these have much more accurate source positions due to their spatial resolution than that of {Chandra} and longer wavelength infrared data. We concentrate our identifications in the HSC $g$ band and WIRCam $K_{\rm s}$ band-based catalogs. To select the best counterpart, we utilize a novel extension of the likelihood-ratio (LR) analysis, where we use the X-ray flux as well as $g - K_{\rm s}$ colors to calculate the likelihood ratio. Spectroscopic and photometric redshifts of the counterparts are summarized. Also, simple X-ray spectroscopy is made on the sources with sufficient source counts.   We present the resulting catalog in an electronic form. The main ID catalog contains 403 X-ray sources and includes X-ray fluxes, luminosities, $g$ and $K_{\rm s}$ band magnitudes, redshifts, and their sources, optical spectroscopic properties, as well as intrinsic absorption column densities and power-law indices from simple X-ray spectroscopy. The identified X-ray sources include 27 Milky-Way objects, 57 type I AGNs, 131 other AGNs, and 15 galaxies. The catalog serves as a basis for further investigations of the properties of the X-ray and near-infrared sources in this field. (Abridged)
