  Because early black holes (BHs) grew to $\sim10^{9} ~M_\odot$ in less than 1 Gyr of cosmic time, BH seeding models face stringent constraints. To efficiently constrain the parameter space of possible seeding criteria, we combine the advantages of the cosmological IllustrisTNG (TNG) simulations with the flexibility of semi-analytic modeling. We identify TNG galaxies as BH seeding sites based on various criteria including a minimum gas mass of $10^7$-$10^9~M_\odot$, total host mass of $10^{8.5}$-$10^{10.5}~M_\odot$, and a maximum gas metallicity of $0.01 - 0.1 ~Z_\odot$. Each potential host is assigned a BH seed with a probability of $0.01 - 1$; these BHs are then traced through the TNG galaxy merger tree. This approach improves upon the predictive power of the simple TNG BH seeding prescription, especially in the low-mass regime at high redshift, and it is readily adaptable to other cosmological simulations. Most of our seed models predict $z\lesssim4$ BH mass densities that are consistent with empirical data as well as the TNG BHs. However, high-redshift BH number densities can differ by factors of $\sim$ 10 - 100 between models. In most models, $\lesssim10^5~M_\odot$ BHs substantially outnumber heavier BHs at high redshifts. Mergers between such BHs are prime targets for gravitational-wave detection with LISA. The $z=0$ BH mass densities in most models agree well with observations, but our strictest seeding criteria fail at high redshift. Our findings strongly motivate the need for better empirical constraints on high-$z$ BHs, and they underscore the significance of recent AGN discoveries with JWST.

  We present a sample of SRG/eROSITA X-ray sources located in the eastern Galactic hemisphere (0&lt;l&lt;180 deg), with significant proper motions according to GAIA eDR3 measurements and whose extragalactic nature has been confirmed. The catalog consists of 248 extragalactic sources with spectroscopically measured redshifts. It includes all objects available in the Simbad database and matched to the identified optical component within a radius of 0.5 arcsec. Additionally, the catalog includes 18 sources with the spectral redshift measurements based on observations at the Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope RTT-150. The sources of the catalog are AGNs of various types (Sy1, Sy2, LINER), quasars, radio galaxies, and star-forming galaxies. The imitation of significant proper motions can be explained (previously known in astrometry as the VIM effect) by the presence of transient events on the line of sight in the field of view of AGN nuclei and quasars (within the GAIA resolution element). Such astrophysical phenomena may be the supernovae outbursts, tidal destruction events in AGNs with double nuclei, variability of large-mass supergiants, the presence of O-B associations in field of view of variable brightness AGN, etc. A model of flares with a fast rise and exponential decay profile allows to describe the variable positional parameters of most similar sources observed in GAIA. This cross-matching approach of the X-ray source catalogs of the SRG/eROSITA observatory and the optical catalog of the GAIA observatory can be used as an independent technique for detecting transient events in the neighborhood of AGN core (on scales of several hundred parsecs in the picture plane).

  A long-standing question related to nova eruptions is how these eruptions can lead to the formation of dust despite the ostensibly inhospitable environment for dust within the hot, irradiated ejecta. Novae in systems such as the symbiotic binary RS Oph offers a articularly clear view of some nova shocks and any associated dust production. Here we use spectropolarimetric monitoring of the RS Oph starting two days after its eruption in 2021 Aug. to show that: dust was present in the RS Oph system as early as two days into the 2021 eruption; the spatial distribution of this early dust was asymmetric, with components both aligned with and perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary; between two and nine days after the start of the eruption, this early dust was gradually destroyed; and dust was again created, aligned roughly with the orbital plane of the binary, more than 80 days after the start of the outburst, most likely as a result of shocks that arose as the ejecta interacted with circumbinary material concentrated in the orbital plane. Modelling of X-rays and very-high energy GeV and TeV emission from RS Oph days to months into the 2021 eruption suggests that collisions between the ejecta and the circumbinary material may have led to shock formation in two regions: the polar - perpendicular to the orbital plane where collimated outflows have been observed after prior eruptions, and a circumbinary torus in the orbital plane. The observations described here indicate that dust formed in approximately the same two regions, supporting the connection between shocks and dust in novae and revealing a very early onset of asymmetry. The spectropolarimetric signatures of RS Oph in the first week into the 2021 outburst indicate: polarized flux across the H{\alpha} emission line and position angle orientation relative to the radio axis are similar to the spectropolarimetric signatures of AGNs.

  We present the results of our search for highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) the X-ray flux from which changed by more than an order of magnitude during the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. Using the eROSITA data obtained in the period from December 2019 to February 2022, we have found 1325 sources the X-ray flux from which in the 0.3-2.3 keV energy band changed by more than a factor of 10 at a confidence level of at least 99.73 %. Of them, 635 objects have been classified as AGNs or AGN candidates. We describe the procedure of searching for highly variable sources and the selection of extragalactic objects among them and describe the statistical properties of the produced catalog. We provide a catalog of 49 sources for which a statistically significant flux in their low state was detected. For the latter we provide their light curves and X-ray spectra and discuss in detail the most interesting of them.
