The Seyfert galaxy Markarian 590 offers a rare glimpse into the dynamic life cycle of black hole accretion, captured across multiple wavelengths from the years 1975 to 2025. Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $α_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $λ_{Edd}$, with a break at $λ_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum.

Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is widely acknowledged to regulate the growth of massive galaxies, though its driving mechanisms are debated. Prevailing theories suggest that AGN-driven outflows are driven either by radiation pressure acting directly on the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) or by hot winds entraining cooler ISM gas, but the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain. By combining optical emission line measurements with highly ionized UV emission lines, it is possible to constrain whether the pressure source applied to ionized clouds is primarily radiation or primarily hydrodynamic, and thus constrain the dominant driver. This study presents the first multi-object analysis of far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra from galactic-scale AGN-driven outflows in obscured quasars, based on Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of five low-redshift targets. By comparing narrow-line region UV emission line ratios to theoretical models that vary the importance of the two pressure sources, we find three out of five targets fall within the radiation pressure-dominated regime. A fourth target exhibits intermediate emission-line ratios that suggest radiation pressure and pressure from a hot wind are both dynamically important. Finally, the lowest-luminosity object in our sample may have a dynamically important hot wind component, but non-detections prevent a clear conclusion in this case. These results suggest radiation pressure dominates circum-nuclear narrow-line region cloud dynamics, but pressure from a hot wind also plays a role in some cases. This is consistent with AGN feedback scenarios mediated by radiation pressure or a short-lived hot wind phase that dissipates after initially accelerating outflows.

We perform the first systematic study of the minute-to-hours-timescale stochastic variability observed in the X-ray luminosity of tidal disruption events (TDEs) using XMM-Newton data and Fourier analysis methods. We measure the spectral properties, power spectral densities (PSDs), fractional variability amplitudes, and energy dependence of the variability for 18 TDEs spanning 54 observations, of which 27 occur in thermal disk-dominated states and 27 show a nonthermal hard X-ray corona. Compared to pure thermal sources, we find TDEs with coronae are more X-ray variable and show steeper PSDs indicating longer correlation timescales. This state-transition behavior is qualitatively similar to X-ray binaries, which show higher fractional variability in the hard state than in the soft state. However, newborn TDE coronae show systematically flatter PSDs and softer energy spectra than their long-lived AGN counterparts. We also show that the variability amplitude of thermal TDEs increases with photon energy, consistent with variations sourced by local temperature fluctuations and exponentially enhanced in the Wien tail. Our work demonstrates that combining spectral and timing properties of X-ray TDEs can probe the microphysics of newly formed accretion flows around supermassive black holes, and that the coronae formed in TDEs fundamentally differ from those in AGN.

Neutrino emission from astrophysical sources has long been considered a signature of cosmic-ray acceleration. The IceCube neutrino observatory has observed a diffuse flux of TeV-PeV neutrinos, but very few confirmed sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), IceCube has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since May 2011. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) $γ$-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1, along with additional alerts issued later. In this work, we consider 368 alerts, up to July 8, 2025, that are within HAWC's field of view. We observe approximately a 5\% coincident detection rate, which is consistent with expectations from background. Two of these detections contain the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. We discuss the likelihood that the neutrino/$γ$-ray coincidences are false positives and a brief overview of the results.

Modern cosmology and galaxy formation rely on an understanding of how cosmic baryons are distributed, a significant portion of which exist in the diffuse gas confined to halos. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a promising probe of the Universe's ionized gas. At low redshift, the contribution to the dispersion measure (DM) from the intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening halos is subdominant, allowing us to study the circumgalactic media (CGM) of the host galaxies. We select a sample of five local universe FRBs whose host interstellar medium (ISM) DM is negligible and use these to constrain the mass of the CGM in each halo. We find that one of our sources, the only massive elliptical host galaxy, has been evacuated of its baryons ($M_\mathrm{gas}=0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.02}M_\mathrm{h}$, corresponding to $\sim$10$\%$ of the cosmological average $\frac{Ω_b}{Ω_m}$). This galaxy shows evidence of a past episode of AGN activity, consistent with the picture of strong AGN feedback in galaxy group-scale halos. The other sources are consistent with existing multiwavelength data and tentatively support more baryon retention in $L_*$ galaxies compared to group-scale halos. We show that FRBs can measure the halo gas fraction $f_\mathrm{gas}$ in halos of mass $M_\mathrm{h}\sim10^{11-13}M_\odot$, and up to $\sim10^{14}M_\odot$ if galaxy cluster hosts are included, which is a larger range than other gas probes can access. Finally, we demonstrate that a large sample of local universe FRBs, such as those expected from upcoming all-sky radio telescopes, will enable precision measurements of halo gas, which is crucial for understanding the effects of feedback.
