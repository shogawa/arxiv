  The hierarchical structure formation paradigm predicts the formation of pairs of supermassive black holes in merging galaxies. When both (or one) members of the SMBH pair are unobscured AGNs, the system can be identified as a dual (or offset) AGN. Quantifying the abundance of these AGN pairs as functions of separation, redshift and host properties is crucial to understanding SMBH formation and AGN fueling in the broad context of galaxy formation. The High Latitude Wide Area Survey with Roman, with its unprecedented combination of sensitivity, spatial resolution, area and NIR wavelength coverage, will revolutionize the study of galactic-scale environments of SMBH pairs. This white paper summarizes the science opportunities and technical requirements on the discovery and characterization of SMBH pairs down to galactic scales (i.e., less than tens of kpc) over broad ranges of redshift (1&lt;z&lt;7) and luminosity (Lbol&gt;1E42 erg/s).

  In this review (the third in the series focused on a small two-band UV-photometry mission), we assess possibilities for a small UV two-band photometry mission in studying accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs; mass range $\sim 10^6$-$10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$). We focus on the following observational concepts: (i) dedicated monitoring of selected type-I Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in order to measure the time delay between the far-UV, the near-UV, and other wavebands (X-ray and optical), (ii) nuclear transients including (partial) tidal disruption events and repetitive nuclear transients, and (iii) the study of peculiar sources, such as changing-look AGN, hollows and gaps in accretion disks, low-luminosity AGN, and candidates for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs; mass range $\sim 10^2$-$10^5\,M_{\odot}$) in galactic nuclei. For tidal disruption events (TDEs), high-cadence UV monitoring is crucial for distinguishing among different scenarios for the origin of the UV emission. The small two-band UV space telescope will also provide the information about the near- and far-UV continuum variability for rare transients, such as repetitive partial TDEs and jetted TDEs. We also discuss the possibilities to study and analyze sources with non-standard accretion flows, such as AGN with gappy disks, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei with intermittent accretion, and SMBH binaries potentially involving intermediate-mass black holes.

  In the current JWST era, rest-frame UV spectra play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar properties of the first galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR, $z&gt;6$). Here, we compare well-known and reliable optical diagrams sensitive to the main ionization source (i.e., star formation, SF; active galactic nuclei, AGN; shocks) to UV counterparts proposed in the literature - the so-called ``UV-BPT diagrams'' - using the HST COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY), the largest high-quality, high-resolution and broad-wavelength range atlas of far-UV spectra for 45 local star-forming galaxies. In particular, we explore where CLASSY UV line ratios are located in the different UV diagnostic plots, taking into account state-of-the-art photoionization and shock models and, for the first time, the measured ISM and stellar properties (e.g., gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, carbon abundance, stellar age). We find that the combination of C III] $\lambda\lambda$1907,9 He II $\lambda1640$ and O III] $\lambda$1666 can be a powerful tool to separate between SF, shocks and AGN at sub-solar metallicities. We also confirm that alternative diagrams without O III] $\lambda$1666 still allow us to define a SF-locus with some caveats. Diagrams including C IV $\lambda\lambda$1548,51 should be taken with caution given the complexity of this doublet profile. Finally, we present a discussion detailing the ISM conditions required to detect UV emission lines, visible only in low gas-phase metallicity (12+log(O/H) $\lesssim8.3$) and high ionization parameter (log($U$) $\gtrsim-2.5$) environments. Overall, CLASSY and our UV toolkit will be crucial in interpreting the spectra of the earliest galaxies that JWST is currently revealing.

  We present recent Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) 5 GHz radio observations of the nearby, luminous Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 for comparison to similar VLBA observations made on 1997 April 26. By cross-correlating the positions of emitting regions across both epochs, we find that spatially-resolved extra-nuclear radio knots in this system have sub-relativistic transverse speeds (v &lt; 0.1c). We discuss sources of the observed knots and how the radio emission relates to additional phases of gas in the central ~150 pcs of this system. We suggest that the most likely explanation for the observed emission is synchrotron radiation formed by shocked host media via interactions between AGN winds and the host environment.

  With its capacity to observe $\sim 10^{5-6}$ faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) out to redshift $z\approx 6$, Roman is poised to reveal a population of $10^{4-6}\, {\rm M_\odot}$ black holes during an epoch of vigorous galaxy assembly. By measuring the light curves of a subset of these AGN and looking for periodicity, Roman can identify several hundred massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with 5-12 day orbital periods, which emit copious gravitational radiation and will inevitably merge on timescales of $10^{3-5}$ years. During the last few months of their merger, such binaries are observable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a joint ESA/NASA gravitational wave mission set to launch in the mid-2030s. Roman can thus find LISA precursors, provide uniquely robust constraints on the LISA source population, help identify the host galaxies of LISA mergers, and unlock the potential of multi-messenger astrophysics with massive black hole binaries.

  In this work, we examine the application of the wavelet transform to the X-ray timing analyses of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and quasi-periodic eruption sources (QPEs). Several scenarios are simulated to test the effectiveness of the wavelet analysis to stationary and non-stationary data. We find that the power spectral density (PSD) slope and the nature of the periodic signal can influence the ability to identify important features in the wavelet power spectrum. In general, weak and transient features can be discerned, which make the wavelet spectrum an important tool in examining AGN light curves. We carried out a wavelet analysis to four unique objects: Ark 120, IRAS 13224-3809, RE J1034+396, and the QPE GSN 069. The well-known quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in RE J1034+396 is significantly detected in the wavelet power spectrum. In IRAS 13224-3809, significant transient features appear during a flare at frequencies coincident with previously detected reverberation signals. Finally, the wavelet power spectrum of the QPE GSN 069 significantly reveals four persistent signals that exhibit a 3:2 ratio in oscillation frequencies, consistent with high-frequency QPOs in stellar mass X-ray binaries, but we cannot rule out the possibility this is an artefact of the calculation.
