  We present CO(1-0) observations of 50 star-forming galaxies at 0.01&lt;z&lt;0.35, for which 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH emission flux or its upper limit is available. A scaling relation between 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH luminosity and CO(1-0) luminosity is established covering ~2 orders of magnitude in total IR luminosity and CO luminosity, with a scatter of ~0.23 dex: $\mathrm{log}\,L_\mathrm{3.3}/\mathrm{L}_\odot=(1.00\pm0.07)\times\mathrm{log}\,L_\mathrm{CO(1-0)}^\prime/(\mathrm{K\,km\,s^{-1}\,pc^2})+(-1.10\pm0.70)$. The slope is near unity, allowing the use of a single value of $\langle\mathrm{log}\,(L_\mathrm{3.3}/L_\mathrm{CO(1-0)}^\prime)\rangle=-1.09\pm0.36~[\mathrm{L}_\odot/(\mathrm{K\,km\,s^{-1}\,pc^2})]$ in the conversion between 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH and CO luminosities. The variation in the $L_\mathrm{3.3}/L_\mathrm{CO}^\prime$ ratio is not dependent on the galaxy properties, including total IR luminosity, stellar mass, and SFR excess. The total gas mass, estimated using dust-to-gas ratio and dust mass, is correlated with 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH luminosity, in line with the prescription using $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}=0.8-4.5$ covering both normal star-forming galaxies and starburst galaxies. AGN-dominated galaxies tend to have a lower $L_\mathrm{3.3}/L_\mathrm{CO}^\prime$ than non-AGN galaxies, which needs to be investigated further with an increased sample size. The established $L_\mathrm{3.3}$-$L_\mathrm{CO}^\prime$ correlation is expected to be applicable to wide-field near-infrared spectrophotometric surveys that allow the detection of 3.3$\,\mu$m emission from numerous low-redshift galaxies.

  X-ray polarimetric observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE) is an excellent tool for probing the geometry and dynamics of X-ray emitting corona in active galactic nuclei (AGN). This work aims to investigate the geometry of the X-ray corona in the Seyfert 2 AGN, NGC 2110, using its first polarimetric observation with IXPE, conducted over a net exposure of 554 ks beginning on October 16, 2024. We performed a model-independent analysis of the 2-8 keV IXPE polarimetric observation to estimate the polarization properties of NGC 2110. Furthermore, we performed spectral and spectro-polarimetric analyses combining IXPE data with archival observations from NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Swift-XRT to derive detailed spectral and polarization properties. From the spectro-polarimetric analyses, an upper limit on the polarization degree (PD) of 7.6% (at the 99% confidence) was estimated in the 2-8 keV band. The spectro-polarimetric analysis in the 5.66-8 keV band yielded a looser upper limit of 27% at the 99 % confidence. Comparing the measured polarization properties, coronal parameters, and inclination angle of NGC 2110 with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MONK) simulations suggest that the current polarization measurements lack the sensitivity to place definitive constraints on the coronal geometry. The upper limits on PD, as derived from our analysis at the 99% confidence level, indicate that polarization remains undetected at a statistically significant level. Consequently, we are unable to determine whether the corona is elongated along the disk or more compact and spherical. Future observations with improved sensitivity will be crucial to breaking these degeneracies and providing deeper insight into the coronal structure of NGC 2110.

  Spatially resolved spectral studies of radio-AGN host galaxies have shown that these systems can impact the ionised gas on galactic scales. However, whether jet and radiation-driven feedback occurs simultaneously is still unclear. We select a large and representative sample of 806 radio-AGN from the MaNGA survey, from $L_\mathrm{1.4GHz}\approx10^{21}-10^{25}$W/Hz, and trace the warm ionised gas kinematics using the [OIII] emission line from the IFU spectra. We measure the [OIII] line width and compare it to the stellar velocity dispersion to determine the presence and location of the disturbed gas. We find most disturbed [OIII] kinematics and proportion of disturbed sources up to a radial distance of 0.25$R_{eff}$, when both radio and optical AGN are present in a source, and the radio luminosity is larger than $10^{23}$W/Hz. When either radio or optical-AGN are present, the impact on [OIII] is milder. Irrespective of the presence of an optical-AGN, we find significant differences in the feedback from high and low luminosity radio-AGN only up to a radial distance of 0.25$R_{eff}$. The presence of more kinematically disturbed warm ionised gas in the central region of radio-AGN host galaxies is related to both jets and radiation in these sources. We propose that in moderate radio luminosity AGN ($L_\mathrm{1.4GHz}\approx10^{23}-10^{25}$W/Hz) gas clouds pushed to high velocities by the jets (radiation) are driven to even higher velocities by the impact of radiation (jets) when both radio and optical-AGN are present. At lower luminosities ($L_\mathrm{1.4GHz}\approx10^{21}-10^{23}$W/Hz), the correlation between the disturbed ionised gas and enhanced radio emission could either be due to wind-driven shocks powering the radio emission, or low-power jets disturbing the gas.

  As the most massive nodes of the cosmic web, galaxy clusters represent the best probes of structure formation. Over time, they grow by accreting and disrupting satellite galaxies, adding those stars to the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). However, the formation pathways of different galaxy clusters can vary significantly. To inform upcoming large surveys, we aim to identify observables that can distinguish galaxy cluster formation pathways. Using four different hydrodynamical simulations, Magneticum, TNG100 of IllustrisTNG, Horizon-AGN, and Hydrangea, we study how the fraction of stellar mass in the BCG and ICL ($f_{ICL+BCG}$) relates to the galaxy cluster mass assembly history. For all simulations, $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is the best tracer for the time at which the cluster has accumulated 50% of its mass ($z_{f}$), performing better than other typical dynamical tracers, such as the subhalo mass fraction, the halo mass, and the center shift. More relaxed clusters have higher $f_{ICL+BCG}$, in rare cases up to 90%, while dynamically active clusters have lower fractions, down to 20%, which we find to be independent of the exact implemented baryonic physics. We determine the average increase in $f_{ICL+BCG}$ from stripping and mergers to be between 3-4% per Gyr. $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is tightly traced by the stellar mass ratio between the BCG and both the second (M12) and fourth (M14) most massive cluster galaxy. The average galaxy cluster has assembled half of its halo mass by $z_{f}=0.67$ (about 6 Gyr ago), though individual histories vary significantly from $z_{f}=0.06$ to $z_{f}=1.77$ (0.8 to 10 Gyr ago). As all four cosmological simulations consistently find that $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is an excellent tracer of the cluster dynamical state, upcoming surveys can leverage measurements of $f_{ICL+BCG}$ to statistically quantify the assembly of the most massive structures.
