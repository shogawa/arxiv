We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at $5&lt;z_{\rm spec}&lt;7.2$, by requiring broad H$α$ emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad H$α$ luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad H$α$ components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad H$α$ ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Ly$α$ occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope -- in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad H$α$ emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a $\sim 5000$ K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth.

We investigate the correlation between ionized gas outflows, jets, and star formation in a sample of 42 local type-I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibiting significant [O III] outflows. This study uses both new submillimeter (sub-mm) observations and archival data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our analysis, which includes a correction for jet emission in the sub-mm bands, fitting spectral energy distribution, and analyzing spectra, enables us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) through various methods. By comparing radio power and SFRs, we select a sub-sample of jetted AGNs of which radio emission is mostly from the jets. We find that jetted AGNs predominantly lie above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, suggesting a correlation between jet activity and star formation. By comparing dust extinction, we demonstrate that jetted AGNs do not have more dust which is the fuel of both star formation and AGN activity. Therefore, this correlation is more likely to arise from AGN feedback. We also find that the Eddington ratio does not impact the specific SFRs (sSFRs) of our sample. Additionally, for jetted AGNs, stronger radio emission corresponds to higher sSFRs, suggesting that jet emission may promote star formation, i.e., positive feedback. Our results not only shed light on the feedback mechanisms of AGNs but also underscore the complex interplay between black hole activity and star formation in galaxy evolution.

The 21-cm global signal, a treasure trove of information about the nature of the first luminous sources of the Universe, has traditionally been modelled assuming that these early sources were predominantly star-forming galaxies. However, recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed several AGNs as early as z ~ 10 - 10.4 . In light of this, it is important to investigate the contribution of such AGNs to the 21-cm signal. Assuming that these AGNs are seeded by Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and employing an analytical PBH model, consistent with existing cosmological and astrophysical constraints, we show that these exotic objects can have a significant impact on the redshift evolution of the global signal.

We present new measurements of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) from JWST/NIRCam imaging over the redshift range z=4.5-9.7, using photometric catalogs from JADES and public extragalactic fields. Our analysis includes rest-frame UV and B-band LFs, as well as apparent LFs in F090W, F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W. We present the first constraints on the rest-frame B-band LF at z~7-8 and extend existing measurements at z~5 to M(B) = -18 mag. The B-band LFs evolve more strongly with redshift than UV LFs, though both decline more gradually than predicted by simulations at z&gt;5. No single existing simulation reproduces all observed trends, with discrepancies likely driven by assumptions about binary evolution and stellar population synthesis models. The apparent LFs in F356W and F444W show hints of a bright-end excess at all redshifts, extending to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. While extreme emission line galaxies may partially account for it, the excess may also indicate a population of moderately red, optically bright sources - potentially dusty star-forming galaxies or obscured AGNs. Finally, we find that rest-frame B-band luminosity correlates more tightly with stellar mass than UV, making it a powerful tracer of mass assembly and reinforcing the diagnostic value of rest-frame optical LFs in uncovering the physical processes that drive early galaxy formation.

Luminous infrared galaxies are key sites of obscured stellar mass assembly at z &gt; 0.5. Their star formation rates (SFRs) are often estimated using the luminosities of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, or those of the [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine-structure lines, as they are minimally affected by obscuration. It is uncertain whether the calibration of these features as SFR tracers depends on the starburst bolometric luminosity or the level of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. We here investigate the relationship between the luminosities of PAH and Neon lines with star formation rate for highly luminous objects using radiative transfer modeling and archival observations of 42 local Ultraluminous (&gt;= 10^12 L_sun) Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that PAH and [Ne II] features arise mainly in star-forming regions, with small contributions from the AGN or host, but that the [Ne III] line has a mixed contribution from both star formation and AGN activity. We present relations between L_PAH and L_NeII, and both starburst luminosity and SFR. We find relations for lower luminosity (L_IR ~= 10^10-10^12 L_sun) systems underestimate the SFRs in local ULIRGs by up to ~1 dex. The 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features, and the [Ne II] line, are thus good tracers of SFR in ULIRGs. We do not find that a more luminous AGN affects the relationship between SFR and PAH or Neon luminosity, but that it can make PAH emission harder to discern. Our results and derived relations are relevant to studies of star-forming and composite galaxies at z &lt; 3 with the James Webb Space Telescope.  

The X-Ray Dot: Exotic Dust or a Late-Stage Little Red Dot?

JWST's "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are increasingly interpreted as active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dense thermalized gas rather than dust as evidenced by their X-ray weakness, blackbody-like continua, and Balmer line profiles. A key question is how LRDs connect to standard UV-luminous AGN and whether transitional phases exist and if they are observable. We present the "X-Ray Dot" (XRD), a compact source at $z=3.28$ observed by the NIRSpec WIDE GTO survey. The XRD exhibits LRD hallmarks: a blackbody-like ($T_{\rm eff} \simeq 6400\,$K) red continuum, a faint but blue rest-UV excess, falling mid-IR emission, and broad Balmer lines ($\rm FWHM \sim 2700-3200\,km\,s^{-1}$). Unlike LRDs, however, it is remarkably X-ray luminous ($L_\textrm{2$-$10$\,$keV} = 10^{44.18}\,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$) and has a continuum inflection that is bluewards of the Balmer limit. We find that the red rest-optical and blue mid-IR continuum cannot be reproduced by standard dust-attenuated AGN models without invoking extremely steep extinction curves, nor can the weak mid-IR emission be reconciled with well-established X-ray--torus scaling relations. We therefore consider an alternative scenario: the XRD may be an LRD in transition, where the gas envelope dominates the optical continuum but optically thin sightlines allow X-rays to escape. The XRD may thus provide a physical link between LRDs and standard AGN, offering direct evidence that LRDs are powered by supermassive black holes and providing insight into their accretion properties.
