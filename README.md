  The investigation of emission line regions within active galaxies (AGNs) has a rich and extensive history, now extending to the use of AGNs and quasars as "standardizable" cosmological indicators, shedding light on the evolution of our universe. As we enter the era of advanced observatories, such as the successful launch of JWST and the forthcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the landscape of AGN exploration across cosmic epochs is poised for exciting advancements. In this work, we delve into recent developments in AGN variability research, anticipating the substantial influx of data facilitated by LSST. The article highlights recent strides made by the AGN Polish Consortium in their contributions to LSST. The piece emphasizes the role of quasars in cosmology, dissecting the intricacies of their calibration as standard candles. The primary focus centers on the relationship between the broad-line region size and luminosity, showcasing recent breakthroughs that enhance our comprehension of this correlation. These breakthroughs encompass a range of perspectives, including spectroscopic analyses, photoionization modeling, and collaborative investigations with other cosmological tools. The study further touches on select studies, underlining how the synergy of theoretical insights and advancements in observational capabilities has yielded deeper insights into these captivating cosmic entities.

  It is widely accepted that X-ray emission in luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) originates from hot corona. To prevent the corona from over-cooling by strong X-ray emission, steady heating to the corona is essential, for which the most promising mechanisms is the magnetic reconnection. Detailed studies of the coupled disc and corona, in the frame of magnetic field transferring accretion-released energy from the disc to the corona, reveal that the thermal electrons can only produce X-ray spectrum with $\Gamma_{\rm 2-10\,keV}&gt;2.1$, which is an inevitable consequence of the radiative coupling of the thermal corona and disc. In the present work, we develop the magnetic-reconnection-heated corona model by taking into account the potential non-thermal electrons accelerated in the magnetic reconnection process, in addition to the thermal electrons. We show that the features of the structure and spectrum of the coupled disc and corona can be affected by the fraction of magnetic energy allocated to thermal electrons. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of the power-law index and energy range of non-thermal electrons and the magnetic field on the spectrum. It is found that the X-ray spectrum from the Comptonization of the hybrid electrons can be flatter than that from thermal electrons only, in agreement with observations. By comparing with the observed hard X-ray data, we suggest that a large fraction ($&gt;40\%$) of the magnetic energy be allocated to the non-thermal electrons in the luminous and flat X-ray spectrum AGNs.

  Outflows in the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) are considered to play a key role in the host galaxy evolution through transfer of a large amount of energy. A Narrow Line Region (NLR) in the AGN is composed of ionized gas extending from pc-scales to kpc-scales. It has been suggested that shocks are required for ionization of the NLR gas. If AGN outflows generate such shocks, they will sweep through the NLR and the outflow energy will be transferred into a galaxy-scale region. In order to study contribution of the AGN outflow to the NLR-scale shock, we measure the [\ion{Fe}{2}]$\lambda12570$/[\ion{P}{2}]$\lambda11886$ line ratio, which is a good tracer of shocks, using near-infrared spectroscopic observations with WINERED (Warm INfrared Echelle spectrograph to Realize Extreme Dispersion and sensitivity) mounted on the New Technology Telescope. Among 13 Seyfert galaxies we observed, the [\ion{Fe}{2}] and [\ion{P}{2}] lines were detected in 12 and 6 targets, respectively. The [\ion{Fe}{2}]/[\ion{P}{2}] ratios in 4 targets were found to be higher than 10, which implies the existence of shocks. We also found that the shock is likely to exist where an ionized outflow, i.e., a blue wing in [\ion{S}{3}]$\lambda9533$, is present. Our result implies that the ionized outflow present over a NLR-scale region sweeps through the interstellar medium and generates a shock.
