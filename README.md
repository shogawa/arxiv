We report the first unambiguous detection of refractive substructure in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) using ground-based Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Our analysis of TXS 2005+403 - observed at 1--5 GHz along a line of sight through the Cygnus region - reveals clear signatures of turbulence-induced substructure on long baselines that cannot be explained by the smooth scatter-broadened profile from diffractive effects alone. This signal persists across multiple observations spanning 2010-2019, demonstrating stable scattering properties along the line of sight. The combination of high flux density, compact intrinsic structure, and strong scattering establishes TXS 2005+403 as an exceptional laboratory for probing Galactic turbulence. This detection demonstrates that AGNs can serve as cosmic lighthouses illuminating interstellar plasma across the sky, complementing pulsar scintillation studies and informing scattering mitigation for millimeter-wavelength imaging of Sagittarius A*.

We present a broadband study of the WLQ SDSS J101353.45+492758.1, which displays a nearly featureless UV-optical spectrum with only a weak Mg II line alongside an exceptionally low X-ray flux. We model its spectral energy distribution using the relativistic thin-disk model kerrbb with a power law, and the multicomponent AGN model relagn, a physically motivated extension of agnsed incorporating warm and hot Comptonizing regions. Our fits constrain the black hole mass, accretion rate, X-ray loudness, and coronal energetics. Both approaches yield consistent BH masses of M_{BH} \approx 2 \times 10^{9} M_\odot and an Eddington accretion rate of \dot m \approx 0.1. The relagn fit including a warm Comptonizing region provides a significantly improved representation of the UV-soft X-ray continuum. The warm corona, characterized by kTe \simeq 0.20 keV, Γ \simeq 3.8, and an optical depth τ \simeq 7.26, extends to \sim 34 R_g. The hot corona appears compact and energetically suppressed, leading to an intrinsically weak X ray output with log(L_{X}/L_{bol}) \simeq -4.29, among the lowest reported for WLQs. The α_{ox} \sim 2.06 indicates the source to be in high/soft AGN spectral state. The combination of a luminous, standard disk and extremely weak hot corona suggests that this quasar hosts a highly inefficient inner coronal region. This explains its X-ray faintness and extreme deficit of high-ionization emission lines. The source may represent an AGN analog in "ultrasoft" accretion state, or a system in which the ionizing continuum is suppressed by a compact or quenched corona. Our study suggests that the source is not accreting at high Eddington ratio, highlighting the physical diversity of WLQs, and supports the view that geometric and radiative effects jointly shape their extreme spectral properties.

We present a detailed study of HUDFJ0332.4-2746.6 (HUDF46), a $z \approx 1.84$ overdensity in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, previously identified with HST as a proto-cluster. JWST/NIRISS spectroscopy expands its confirmed membership from 18 to 37 galaxies, while deep HST/ACS, JWST/NIRCam, and JWST/MIRI imaging provide a comprehensive multiwavelength view from the rest-frame UV to the mid-infrared. This dataset probes the population across three dex in stellar mass ($M_\bigstar \approx 10^{7.5\text{--}10.5}\,M_\odot$), delivering the first direct view of a young cluster down to such low-$M_\bigstar$ at $z\gtrsim1$. Assuming virialization, we derive a velocity dispersion of $σ\approx 670\pm 91\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a halo mass of $M_{200} \approx (1.2\pm0.2) \times 10^{14}\,M_\odot$, in agreement with X-ray constraints from deep {\it Chandra} data. Despite residing in a massive halo likely in the hot-halo regime, the population is overwhelmingly star-forming, with no established red sequence and no extended X-ray emission from a hot intracluster medium. HUDF46 members have stellar and structural properties nearly indistinguishable from coeval field galaxies, and the structure hosts only one AGN candidate, found in its brightest galaxy, which lies at the cluster center. Overall, HUDF46 appears to be in a transitional phase prior to the onset of environmental quenching, making its galaxy population a key benchmark for tracing the processes that will later build a passive population and shape the assembly of massive clusters at later cosmic times.

Relativistic jets from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are highly energetic and emit radiation across a wide range of frequencies. Despite several observational studies, their particle composition still remains a key open question. The detection of high-energy neutrinos from blazar sources such as TXS 0506+056 has highlighted the plausibility of hadronic/lepto-hadronic models for AGN jets. To understand the origin of high-energy neutrinos from such sources, it is imperative to capture the complex interplay between the jet dynamics, their composition, and the mechanism of particle acceleration and cooling in relativistic jets. In this pilot study, we have coupled a numerical multi-zone framework for lepto-hadronic modeling, with 3D relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of AGN jets, including external photon fields. Our framework provides synthetic multi-wavelength and neutrino flux by spatially sampling the simulated jet into multiple zones. We investigate the implications of such a framework in exploring the different intrinsic and extrinsic pathways for proton-enrichment in jets. Essentially, we find that for low proton-to-electron number density ratios, producing a substantial jet neutrino flux, requires the underlying proton energy distribution to have a relatively flat spectrum with a power-law index of $\simeq 2.0$. We further find that while intrinsic shocks triggered by kink-instabilities in the jet can accelerate electrons to high energies, they may not be sufficient to produce such flat particle energy distributions for the chosen set of parsec-scale jet parameters. Finally, to produce a significant jet neutrino emission, our simulations suggest the need to consider particle acceleration mechanisms through alternative pathways, either internal or external.

The ionization mechanisms of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), which are common in the local Universe, have been debated for decades. Our nearest large neighbor, M31, is classified as a LINER based on its optical emission line properties within the central kpc. In this work, we present a detailed photoionization modeling of the circumnuclear ionized gas in M31, explicitly tailored to its well-constrained physical conditions, including the absence of ongoing star formation and a currently inactive active galactic nucleus (AGN). Using spatially resolved CFHT/SITELLE observations, we find that photoionization by hot, evolved low-mass stars distributed throughout the bulge can roughly reproduce the observed radial intensity profiles of Hα, H\b{eta}, and [NII]. However, these models fail to match the observed [OIII] emission, producing radial profiles and [O III]/H\b{eta} ratios that are significantly steeper than observed. This discrepancy indicates a deficit of high-energy ionizing photons in standard stellar photoionization models, even with extended ionizing sources. We explore whether this tension can be alleviated by invoking either a bulge-filling, low-density ionized medium surrounding a denser Hα-emitting disk, or enhanced AGN activity in the recent past. While both scenarios can partially increase the [O III] emission, neither provides a fully satisfactory explanation under physically plausible conditions. Together with our earlier results for M81, these findings underscore persistent challenges in explaining LINER-like emission solely through conventional photoionization mechanisms.

X-ray timing of active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides a unique probe of gas accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), which trace gas dynamics in the strongly curved spacetime around SMBHs, are rare in AGN. These signals often are analogs of high-frequency QPOs occasionally seen in some black-hole X-ray binaries, and their scarcity in AGN can partly be attributed to the low frequencies expected for typical SMBH masses. Intriguingly, robust X-ray QPO detections in SMBH systems have so far been reported only in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here we report the discovery of a QPO candidate during the 2018 outburst of the changing-look AGN (CL-AGN) NGC 1566. Numerical simulations indicate that the disk epicyclic oscillations responsible for high-frequency QPOs are damped by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence unless the accretion flow is misaligned and/or eccentric. In TDEs, the stellar debris stream is naturally misaligned with the SMBH spin, while NLS1s may host misaligned disks due to their youth. Motivated by the QPO candidate in NGC 1566, we propose that CL-AGN accretion is also misaligned -- potentially fueled by captured, free-falling broad-line region clouds. This model naturally explains why CL-AGN transition timescales are much shorter than the standard disk viscous timescale. This picture can be tested by searching for QPOs or quasi-periodic eruptions in other CL-AGN.

High-J CO emission in high-redshift galaxies has been studied primarily on an individual-source basis, limiting our ability to draw population-level conclusions about molecular-gas excitation. To address this limitation, we present a catalog of CO spectroscopy based on archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) for a sample of galaxies at z &gt; 3, focusing on high-J transitions (Jup = 9-17). Combining ALMA archival data with published measurements, we compile CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) for 38 well-studied systems spanning z ~ 3.1-6.9, including 5 hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs), 17 submillimeter-bright galaxies (SMGs), and 16 optically selected quasars. The class-median SLEDs rise steeply to Jup = 9 and remain approximately flat through Jup ~ 11-12. SMGs show relatively stronger low- to mid-J emission relative to CO J=9-8, while Hot DOGs exhibit tentative evidence for higher excitation. Comparison with simple excitation models suggests that X-ray dominated region (XDR) heating or dense, shock-heated gas can account for the extended high-J CO SLEDs. A tentative anti-correlation between the CO(9-8)-to-infrared luminosity ratio and excitation among the dusty galaxy populations suggests that the enhanced excitation in Hot DOGs may be driven by XDR heating from obscured AGN activity rather than by shocks.
