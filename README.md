  RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 (RQG) is the earliest massive quiescent galaxy identified to date, inferred to have formed its abundant stellar mass in a single burst that ceases rapidly before $z \sim 8$. An object of such extreme nature challenges our understanding of galaxy formation, requiring rapid growth and quenching mechanisms only 0.6 Gyr after the Big Bang and implying number densities 2 dex higher than currently predicted by simulations. We use synthetic observables to identify analogous systems within the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) and find two massive galaxies dominated by rapidly quenched bursts. Beyond demonstrating that the current FLARES model is capable of producing RQG-like systems, these analogues provide a laboratory within which to study the underlying physics. Their active galactic nuclei (AGN) heat and expel gas, inducing rapid quenching and preventing timely rejuvenation. This causes above-average chemical enrichment at a given stellar mass, with super solar levels predicted for RQG. These metallicities are underestimated by spectral energy distribution fitting and we show that $\alpha$-enhancement cannot be solely responsible. Degeneracies with age and dust attenuation appear the more likely causes. Tensions between observed and simulated number densities can be alleviated in part by considering systematics, but adjustments to AGN feedback, such as allowing super-Eddington accretion rates, may be required for full agreement.

  We present a review of our findings on the origin, drivers, nature, and impact of kiloparsec-scale radio emission in radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. Using radio polarimetric techniques, we probe the dynamics and magnetic (B-) field geometry of outflows in Seyfert and LINER galaxies. Multi-band data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) reveal how low-power jets interact with their environment. These interactions can slow down and disrupt the radio outflows while locally regulating star formation through AGN feedback. Several radio properties correlate strongly with the black hole mass, similar to trends observed in radio-loud (RL) AGN. Although their characteristics differ, RQ systems might not be intrinsically distinct from RL AGN, apart from lower jet powers. Our polarization measurements further suggest a composite model in which a black hole-accretion disk system drives both a collimated jet with a small-pitch-angle helical B-field and a wide-angle wind threaded by a high-pitch-angle helical field.

  Understanding the co-evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) requires accurate modeling of dust-obscured systems. Recent surveys using the Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a large population of dust obscured AGN, challenging current theoretical frameworks. We present an updated version of the Simulated Infrared Extragalactic Dusty Sky (SIDES) simulation framework. Our updates include modified star-forming and starburst galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) templates as well as quiescent and AGN templates. We also incorporate a probabilistic assignment of the fraction of the IR emission that is due to an AGN. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed MIRI source number counts, redshift distributions, and AGN population fractions. We find that AGN dominate at bright flux densities $(S_\nu \gtrsim 20\, \mu \rm Jy$ while main sequence galaxies dominate at the faint end. We also quantify the effects of cosmic variance, showing that surveys with areas below $25\, \rm arcmin^2$ suffer from $\sim 30 \% $ uncertainty in bright AGN counts. Finally, we provide diagnostic color-color diagrams and joint Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and MIRI flux distributions to aid interpretation of current and upcoming JWST surveys.
