  Broadband photometric reverberation mapping (RM) provides a measure of the size of the continuum-emitting region in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous monitoring campaigns of PG 2130+099 disagree as to whether the continuum emitting region size is consistent with that predicted for a standard optically thick geometrically thin accretion disk. We present $\sim$6 months of observations from several robotic telescopes, providing the highest cadence and widest wavelength coverage photometric RM study of PG 2130+099 to date. Our results indicate that inferred size of the continuum-emitting region in PG 2130+099, like many recently observed AGN, is larger than the simplest predictions for an irradiated geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk. We also perform a flux-flux analysis, finding a variable spectrum broadly consistent with a disk, and a constant component with enhanced $\textit{i}$-band emission, potentially due to H$\alpha$. We find some evidence of increasing lag with luminosity, but previous lag measurements are too uncertain to be definitive.

  We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z_{spec} = 6.6379 \pm 0.0035$ with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$~mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$\alpha$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15~$\mu$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $z\gtrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.

  We use HDGAS hydrodynamic simulations to study the impact of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback on the conversion of atomic-gas to molecular-gas within the circumnuclear-disc (CND) of a typical AGN-dominated galaxy. The comparison of CI, CII, and CO line intensities and their ratios in the HDGAS post-processing radiative-transfer analysis reveals the complex interplay between AGN-activity, cold molecular gas properties, and the physical processes governing the evolution of star-formation in galaxies. Our results demonstrate that the CI/CO intensity ratio serves as a reliable indicator of the atomic-to-molecular gas transition. We present the probability distribution function (PDF) and abundance trends of various metal species related to molecular H$2$ gas, highlighting differences in clumpiness and intensity maps between AGN feedback and NoAGN models. The profile of the integrated intensity (moment-0) maps shows that the AGN-feedback model exhibits a lower CI/CO intensity ratio in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (&lt; 50 pc), indicating a smaller atomic-gas abundance and the presence of positive AGN-feedback. Our simulations have successfully predicted the presence of faint-CO emissions extending to larger radii from the galactic center. We also explore the relationships between CII/CO and CI/CII intensity ratios, as well as the ratios versus CO intensity, which provides insights into the "CO-dark" issues. One notable feature in the later time-scale of the AGN model is the presence of a "CO-dark" region, where the intensity of CO emission ($\rm I_{CO}$) is depleted relative to the H$_2$ column density ($N_{\rm H_2}$) compared to the NoAGN model.

  Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Here we present new mid-infrared spectra of the central kiloparsec of five optically-selected QSO2s at redshift z~0.1 obtained with JWST/MIRI/MRS. These QSO2s belong to the QSOFEED sample and they have log Lbol=45.5-46.0 erg/s, global SFRs that place them above the main sequence, and practically identical optical spectral shape and [OIII] luminosity, but their nuclear mid-infrared spectra exhibit an unexpected diversity of both continua and features. They show: 1) 9.7 micron silicate features going from emission (strength of S9.7=0.5) to relatively strong absorption (S9.7=-1.0) and 18 and 23 micron silicates either in emission or flat. In addition, two of the QSO2s show absorption bands of CO, H2O, and aliphatic grains, indicating different levels of nuclear obscuration across the sample. 2) [NeV]/[NeII] ratios ranging from 0.1 to 2.1 and [NeIII]/[NeII] from 1.0 to 3.5, indicating different coronal line and ionizing continuum strengths. 3) Warm molecular gas masses of 1-4x10^7 Msun and warm-to-cold gas mass ratios of 1-2%, with molecular gas excitation likely due to jet-induced shocks in J1430+1339, and to UV heating and/or turbulence in J1509+0434. 4) PAH emission features with equivalent widths ranging from &lt;0.002 to 0.075 micron, from which we measure a larger contribution from neutral molecules (PAH 11.3/6.2=1.3-3.4) and SFRs&lt;3-7 Msun/yr. This unprecedented dataset allowed us to start exploring the role of various AGN and galaxy properties including ionizing continuum, obscuration, electron density, and jet-ISM interactions on some of the spectral differences listed above, but larger samples are now required to fully understand the diversity of QSO2s' nuclear mid-infrared spectra.

  We investigate the intrinsic and observational properties of $z\gtrsim 6$ galaxies hosting coalescing massive black holes (MBHs) that gives rise to gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We adopt a zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation and black hole (BH) co-evolution, zoomed-in on a $M_h \sim 10^{12}~\rm M_{\odot}$ dark matter halo at z = 6, which hosts a fast accreting super-massive black hole (SMBH) and a star-forming galaxy. Following the SMBH formation backward in time, we identify the merging events that concurred to its formation and we pick up the ones that are detectable with LISA. Among these LISA detectable events (LDEs), we select those that, based on their intrinsic properties are expected to be bright in one or more electromagnetic (EM) bands. We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer calculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and continuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra arising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN powered by single accreting BHs. We find that it will be impossible to identify an LDE from the continuum SEDs because of the absence of specific imprints from the merging MBHs. We also compute the profile of the H$_{\rm \alpha}$ line arising from LDEs, considering the contribution from their star-forming regions and the accreting MBHs. We find that the presence of two accreting MBHs would be difficult to infer even if both MBHs accrete at super-Eddington rates. We conclude that the combined detection of GW and EM signals from $z\gtrsim 6$ MBHs is challenging not only because of the poor sky-localization provided by LISA, but also because the loudest GW emitters are not massive enough to leave significant signatures in the emission lines arising from the broad line region.

  We investigate the capabilities of the mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to advance our knowledge of AGN dust using the spectral fitting technique on an AGN collection of 21 nearby (z&lt;0.05) AGN (7 type-1 and 14 type-2) observations obtained with the medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) mode. This collection includes publicly available AGN and data from the collaboration of Galactic Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We developed a tool named MRSPSFisol that decomposes MRS cubes into point-like and extended contributions. We found statistically good fits for 12 targets with current AGN dust models. The model that provides good fits (chi2/dof&lt;2) for {these 12 targets} assumes a combination of clumpy and smooth distribution of dust in a flare-disk geometry where the dust grain size is a free parameter. Still, two and one AGN statistically prefer the disk+wind and the classical clumpy torus model, respectively. However, the currently available models fail to reproduce 40% of the targets, likely due to the extreme silicate features not well reproduced by the models and signatures of water-ice and aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption features in most targets. New models exploring, for instance, new chemistry, are needed to explain the complexity of AGN dust continuum emission observed by JWST.

  Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments have the potential to unveil continuous gravitational wave (CGW) signals from individual massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). Detecting them in both gravitational waves (GW) and the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum will open a new chapter in multimessenger astronomy. We investigate the feasibility of conducting multimessenger studies by combining the CGW detections from an idealized 30-year SKA PTA and the optical data from the forthcoming LSST survey. To this end, we employed the $\texttt{L-Galaxies}$ semi-analytical model applied to the $\texttt{Millennium}$ simulation. We generated 200 different all-sky lightcones that include galaxies, massive black holes, and MBHBs whose emission is modeled based on their star formation histories and gas accretion physics. We predict an average of $\approx 33$ CGW detections, with signal-to-noise ratios $ S/N &gt; 5$. The detected MBHBs are typically at $z &lt; 0.5$, with masses of $ \sim 3 \times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$, mass ratios $&gt; 0.6$ and eccentricities $\lesssim 0.2$. In terms of EM counterparts, we find less than 15% of these systems to be connected with an AGN detectable by LSST, while their host galaxies are easily detectable ($ &lt; 23$ mag) massive ($ M_{\star} &gt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) ellipticals with typical star formation rates ($10^{-15} yr^{-1} &lt; sSRF &lt; 10^{-10} yr^{-1}$). Although the CGW-EM counterpart association is complicated by poor sky localization (only 35% of these CGWs are localized within $\rm 100\, deg^2$), the number of galaxy host candidates can be considerably reduced (thousands to tens) by applying priors based on the galaxy-MBH correlations. However, picking the actual host among these candidates is highly non-trivial, as they occupy a similar region in any optical color-color diagram. Our findings highlight the considerable challenges entailed in opening the low-frequency multimessenger GW sky.

  Black hole (BH) accretion disks are often coupled to ultramagnetized and tenuous plasma coronae close to their central BHs. The coronal magnetic field can exchange energy between the disk and the BH, power X-ray emission, and lead to jetted outflows. Up until now, the coronal physics of BH accretion has only been studied using fluid modeling. We construct the first model of a BH feeding on a zero-net-flux accretion disk corona based on kinetic plasma physics. This allows us to self-consistently capture how collisionless relativistic magnetic reconnection regulates the coronal dynamics. We present global, axisymmetric, general relativistic particle-in-cell simulation of a BH coupled, via a series of magnetic loops, to a razor-thin accretion disk. We target the jet-launching regime where the loops are much larger than the BH. We ray-trace high-energy synchrotron lightcurves and track the flow of Poynting flux through the system, including along specific field-line bundles. Reconnection on field lines coupling the BH to the disk dominates the synchrotron output, regulates the flux threading the BH, and ultimately untethers magnetic loops from the disk, ejecting them via a magnetically striped Blandford-Znajek jet. The jet is initially Poynting-dominated, but reconnection operates at all radii, depleting the Poynting power logarithmically in radius. Coronal emission and jet launch are linked through reconnection in our model. This link might explain coincident X-ray flaring and radio-jet ejections observed during hard-to-soft X-ray binary state transitions. It also suggests that striped jet launch could be heralded by a bright coronal counterpart. Our synchrotron signatures resemble variability observed from the peculiar changing-look AGN, 1ES 1927+654, and from Sagittarius A*, hinting that processes similar to our model may be at work in these contexts.

  We conduct an analysis of over 60,000 dwarf galaxies (7&lt;=log(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;=10) in search of photometric variability indicative of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using data from the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a time domain survey on the Pan-STARRS telescopes, we construct light curves for each galaxy in up to four bands (griz) where available. We select objects with AGN-like variability by fitting each light curve to a damped random walk (DRW) model. After quality cuts and removing transient contaminants, we identify 1100 variability-selected AGN candidates (representing 2.4% of the available sample). We analyze their spectra to measure various emission lines and calculate black hole (BH) masses, finding general agreement with previously found mass scaling-relations and nine potential IMBH candidates. Furthermore, we re-analyze the light curves for our candidates to calculate the dampening timescale tau_DRW associated with the DRW and see a similar correlation between this value and the BH mass. Finally, we estimate the active fraction as a function of stellar mass and see evidence that active fraction increases with host mass.

  Recent observations have identified an abundance of high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) with supermassive black holes (BHs) that are over-massive compared to the local BH mass$-$total stellar mass ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$) relation. $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ measurements at high-$z$ are critical for probing the growth histories of BHs and their host galaxies, including BH seeding and evolution of the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation. However, BH masses in high-$z$ AGN are generally estimated from single-epoch measurements, which are anchored to local relations based on reverberation mapping and carry large systematic uncertainties. Alternate $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ detection methods such as dynamical measurements are more reliable but currently only possible in the local Universe or with strongly lensed systems. Recently, dynamical $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ measurements were made in a $z\sim2$ lensed quiescent galaxy as well as a sample of six local galaxies identified as likely relics of common quiescent red nugget galaxies at cosmic noon. We compare the $z\sim2$ red nugget and relic BHs to recent results for $4&lt;z&lt;11$ AGN, quasars, and Little Red Dots. Intriguingly, the $z\sim2$ galaxy and local relic galaxies all lie on both the local $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation for bulges and the $4&lt;z&lt;7$ $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation. Our results suggest the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation for bulges was likely in place at high-$z$ and indicate careful consideration of different evolutionary pathways is needed when building BH scaling relations. While improvements to $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ estimates in AGN will increase our confidence in high-$z$ BH masses, detecting BHs in relic galaxies and lensed galaxies presents a complementary probe of the high-$z$ relations.   

Time-Dependent AGN Disc Winds II -- Effects of Photoionization

  We use a combination of radiation hydrodynamics (rad-HD) and photoionization modeling to study line-driven disc winds for a range of black hole masses. We refined previous models by incorporating heating, cooling, and radiation forces from spectral lines calculated using a photoionization code, assuming that composite AGN spectra irradiate the gas. For black holes with masses $3 \times 10^{6} \lesssim {\rm M_{BH}/M_{\odot}} \lesssim 10^{8}$, the mass loss rate, ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ increases proportionally with the disk Eddington fraction, $\Gamma$. The insensitivity of ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ to the hardness of the spectral energy distribution (SED) arises because the central region is dominated by radiation in the frequency range with ample spectral lines for the range of $M_{BH}$ considered here. Disc winds are suppressed or fail outside the above mass range because of a dearth of line-driving photons. We find \emph{stronger} winds, both in terms of ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ and wind velocity compared to previous disc wind models. Our winds are stronger because of an enhanced line force from including many spectral lines in the X-ray band. These lines were unavailable and, hence, unaccounted for in previous photoionization studies and their subsequent application to AGN wind models. For $\Gamma \gtrsim 0.4$, ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ is higher than the assumed disc accretion rate, implying that the wind feeds back strongly. Our findings indicate the necessity of utilizing comprehensive and current atomic data along with a more thorough approach to radiation transfer - both spatially and temporally - to accurately calculate the line force.

  Galaxy interaction and merging have clear effects on the systems involved. We find an increase in the star formation rate (SFR), potential ignition of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and significant morphology changes. However, at what stage during interactions or mergers these changes begin to occur remains an open question. With a combination of machine learning and visual classification, we select a sample of 3,162 interacting and merging galaxies in the Cosmic Evolutionary Survey (COSMOS) field across a redshift range of 0.0 - 1.2. We divide this sample into four distinct stages of interaction based on their morphology, each stage representing a different phase of the dynamical timescale. We use the rich ancillary data available in COSMOS to probe the relation between interaction stage, stellar mass, SFR, and AGN fraction. We find that the distribution of SFRs rapidly change with stage for mass distributions consistent with being drawn from the same parent sample. This is driven by a decrease in the fraction of red sequence galaxies (from 17% as close pairs to 1.4% during merging) and an increase in the fraction of starburst galaxies (from 7% to 32%). We find the AGN fraction increases by a factor of 1.2 only at coalescence. We find the effects of interaction peak at the point of closest approach and coalescence of the two systems. We show that the point in time of the underlying dynamical timescale - and its related morphology - is as important to consider as its projected separation.   

The global energetics of radio AGN kinetic feedback in the local

  [abridged] AGN feedback is a crucial ingredient for understanding galaxy evolution. However, a complete quantitative time-dependent framework, including the dependence of such feedback on AGN, host galaxy, and host halo properties, is yet to be developed. Using the complete sample of 682 radio AGN from the LOFAR-eFEDS survey ($z&lt;0.4$), we derive the average jet power of massive galaxies and its variation as a function of stellar mass ($M_*$), halo mass ($M_h$) and radio morphology. We compare the incidence distributions of compact and complex radio AGN as a function of specific black hole kinetic power, $\lambda_{\rm Jet}$, and synthesise, for the first time, the radio luminosity function (RLF) by $M_*$ and radio morphology. Our RLF and derived total radio AGN kinetic luminosity density, $\log \Omega_{\rm kin}/[\rm {W~Mpc^{-3}}]=32.15_{-0.34}^{+0.18}$, align with previous work. We find that kinetic feedback from radio AGN dominates over any plausible inventory of radiatively-driven feedback for galaxies with $\log M_*/M_\odot &gt; 10.6$. More specifically, it is the compact radio AGN which dominate this global kinetic energy budget for all but the most massive galaxies ($10.6 &lt; \log M_*/M_{\odot} &lt; 11.5$). Subsequently, we compare the average injected jet energy against the galaxy and halo binding energy, and against the total thermal energy of the host gas within halos. We find that radio AGN cannot fully unbind their host galaxies nor host halos. However, they have enough energy to impact the global thermodynamical heating and cooling balance in small halos and significantly contribute to offsetting local cooling flows in even the most massive clusters cores. Overall, our findings provide important insights on jet powering, accretion processes and black hole-galaxy coevolution via AGN feedback, as well as a clear observational benchmark to calibrate AGN feedback simulations.
