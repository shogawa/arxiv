  Very recently Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have independently reported the evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), which can unveil the formation of primordial seeds of inhomogeneities in the early universe. With the SGWB parameters inferred from PTAs data, we can make a prediction of the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) clusters from the domain walls of axion-like particles (ALPs). These primordial seeds can naturally provide a solution to the early Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) formation indicated by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Besides, the mass of ALP is also constrained, $m_a \sim 10^{-15}-10^{-14}$ eV, within the reach of upcoming cavity experiments.

  The broad line region (BLR) size-luminosity relation has paramount importance for estimating the mass of black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Traditionally, the size of the H$\beta$ BLR is often estimated from the optical continuum luminosity at 5100\angstrom{} , while the size of the H$\alpha$ BLR and its correlation with the luminosity is much less constrained. As a part of the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP) which provides six-year photometric and spectroscopic monitoring data, we present our measurements of the H$\alpha$ lags of 6 high-luminosity AGNs. Combined with the measurements for 42 AGNs from the literature, we derive the size-luminosity relations of H$\alpha$ BLR against broad H$\alpha$ and 5100\angstrom{} continuum luminosities. We find the slope of the relations to be $0.61\pm0.04$ and $0.59\pm0.04$, respectively, which are consistent with the \hb{} size-luminosity relation. Moreover, we find a linear relation between the 5100\angstrom{} continuum luminosity and the broad H$\alpha$ luminosity across 7 orders of magnitude. Using these results, we propose a new virial mass estimator based on the H$\alpha$ broad emission line, finding that the previous mass estimates based on the scaling relations in the literature are overestimated by up to 0.7 dex at masses lower than $10^7$~M$_{\odot}$.

  Mergers of galaxies are a ubiquitous phenomenon in the Universe and represent a natural consequence of the ``bottom-up'' mass accumulation and galaxy evolution cosmological paradigm. It is generally accepted that the peak of AGN accretion activity occurs at nuclear separations of $\lesssim10$ kpc for major mergers. Here we present new NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations for a subsample of mid-IR preselected dual AGN candidates in an effort to better constrain the column densities along the line-of-sight for each system. Only one dual AGN candidate, J0841+0101, is detected as a single, unresolved source in the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR imaging, while the remaining three dual AGN candidates, J0122+0100, J1221+1137, and J1306+0735, are not detected with NuSTAR; if these non-detections are due to obscuration alone, these systems are consistent with being absorbed by column densities of log($N_{\rm{H}}/\rm{cm}^{-2}$) $\geq$ 24.9, 24.8, and 24.6, which are roughly consistent with previously inferred column densities in these merging systems. In the case of J0841+0101, the analysis of the 0.3-30 keV spectra reveal a line-of-sight column density of $N_{\rm{H}}\gtrsim10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, significantly larger than the column densities previously reported for this system and demonstrating the importance of the higher signal-to-noise XMM-Newton spectra and access to the $&gt;10$ keV energies via NuSTAR. Though it is unclear if J0841+0101 truly hosts a dual AGN, these results are in agreement with the high obscuring columns expected in AGNs in late-stage mergers.

  Surface densities of gas, dust and stars provide a window into the physics of star-formation that, until the advent of high-resolution far-infrared/sub-millimeter observations, has been historically difficult to assess amongst dusty galaxies. To study the link between infrared (IR) surface densities and dust properties, we leverage the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA) archive to measure the extent of cold dust emission in 15 $z\sim2$ IR selected galaxies selected on the basis of having available mid-IR spectroscopy from Spitzer. We use the mid-IR spectra to constrain the relative balance between dust heating from star-formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN), and to measure emission from Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) -- small dust grains that play a key role in the photoelectric heating of gas. In general, we find that dust-obscured star-formation at high IR surface densities exhibits similar properties at low- and high-redshift, namely: local luminous IR galaxies have comparable PAH luminosity to total dust mass ratios as high-$z$ galaxies, and star-formation at $z\sim0-2$ is more efficient at high IR surface densities despite the fact that our sample of high$-z$ galaxies are closer to the main-sequence than local luminous IR galaxies. High star-formation efficiencies are coincident with a decline in the PAH/IR luminosity ratio reminiscent of the deficit observed in far-infrared fine-structure lines. Changes in the gas and dust conditions arising from high star-formation surface densities might help drive the star-formation efficiency up. This could help explain high efficiencies needed to reconcile star-formation and gas volume densities in dusty galaxies at cosmic noon.
