  We present 1.8 years of near-daily Swift monitoring of the bright, strongly variable Type 1 AGN Fairall 9. Totaling 575 successful visits, this is the largest such campaign reported to date. Variations within the UV/optical are well-correlated, with longer wavelengths lagging shorter wavelengths in the direction predicted by thin disk/lamp-post models. The correlations are improved by detrending; subtracting a second-order polynomial fit to the UV/optical light curves to remove long-term trends that are not of interest to this study. Extensive testing indicates detrending with higher-order polynomials removes too much intrinsic variability signal on reverberation timescales. These data provide the clearest detection to date of interband lags within the UV, indicating that neither emission from a large disk nor diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region can independently explain the full observed lag spectrum. The observed X-ray flux variations are poorly correlated with those in the UV/optical. Further, subdivision of the data into four ~160 day light curves shows that the UV/optical lag spectrum is highly stable throughout the four periods, but the X-ray to UV lags are unstable, significantly changing magnitude and even direction from one period to the next. This indicates the X-ray to UV relationship is more complex than predicted by the simple reprocessing model often adopted for AGN. A bowl model (lamp-post irradiation and blackbody reprocessing on a disk with a steep rim) fit suggests the disk thickens at a distance (~10 lt-day) and temperature (~8000K) consistent with the inner edge of the BLR.

  We present a study of the molecular gas in five closely-spaced ($R_{\perp}&lt;20$ kpc) dual quasars ($L_{\rm bol}\gtrsim10^{44}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) at redshifts $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8$ with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The dual quasar phase represents a distinctive stage during the interaction between two galaxies for investigating quasar fueling and feedback effects on the gas reservoir. The dual quasars were selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, with confirmatory spectroscopic validation. Based on the detection of the CO J=2--1 emission line with Band 4, we derived key properties including CO luminosities, line widths, and molecular gas masses for these systems. Among the ten quasars of the five pairs, eight have line detections exceeding $5\sigma$. The detected sources prominently harbor substantial molecular gas reservoirs, with molecular gas masses ($M_{\text{molgas}}$) between $10^{9.6-10.5}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, and molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratios ($\mu_{\text{molgas}}$) spanning $18-97\%$. The overall $\mu_{\text{molgas}}$ of these dual quasars agrees with that of inactive star-forming main-sequence galaxies at comparable redshifts, indicating no clear evidence of quenching. However, intriguing features in each individual system show possible evidence of AGN feedback, matter transfer, and compaction processes.

  We present two uniformly observed spectroscopic samples of Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) (127 at z = 5.7 and 82 at z = 6.6), which we use to investigate the evolution of the LAE population at these redshifts. The observations cover a large field (44 sq. deg) in the North Ecliptic Pole (HEROES), as well as several smaller fields. We have a small number of exotic LAEs in the samples: double-peaked Ly-alpha profiles; very extended red wings; and one impressive lensed LAE cross. We also find three broad-line AGNs. We compare the Ly-alpha line width measurements at the two redshifts, finding that the lower-luminosity LAEs show a strong evolution of decreasing line width with increasing redshift, while the high-luminosity LAEs do not, with a transition luminosity of log L(Ly-alpha) = 43.25 erg s-1 . Thus, at z = 6.6, the high-luminosity LAEs may be producing large ionized bubbles themselves, or they may be residing in overdense galaxy sites that are producing such bubbles. In order to avoid losses in the red wing, the radius of the ionized bubble must be larger than 1 pMpc. The double-peaked LAEs also require transmission on the blue side. For the four at z = 6.6, we use models to estimate the proximity radii, Ra , where the ionizing flux of the galaxy is sufficient to make the surroundings have a low enough neutral fraction to pass the blue light. Since the required Ra are large, multiple ionizing sources in the vicinity may be needed.

  JWST has discovered a large population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at high redshift. Many of these newly discovered AGN have broad permitted lines (typically H$\alpha$), but are extremely weak in the X-rays. Here we present the NIRSpec spectrum of the most extreme of these objects, GN-28074, an AGN at $z=2.26$ with prominent Balmer, Paschen and \HeI broad lines, and with the highest limit on the bolometric to X-ray luminosity ratio among all spectroscopically confirmed AGN in GOODS. This source is also characterized by a mid-IR excess, most likely associated with the AGN torus' hot dust. The high bolometric luminosity and moderate redshift of this AGN allow us to explore its properties more in depth relative to other JWST-discovered AGN. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent, slightly blueshifted absorption of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and \HeI$\lambda$10830. The Balmer absorption lines require gas with densities of $n_{\rm H}&gt; 10^8~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, inconsistent with an ISM origin, but fully consistent with clouds in the Broad Line Region (BLR). This finding suggests that at least part of the X-ray weakness is due to high (Compton thick) X-ray absorption by (dust-free) clouds in the BLR, or in its outer, slowly outflowing regions. GN-28074 is also extremely radio-weak. The radio weakness can also be explained in terms of absorption, as the inferred density of the clouds responsible for H$\alpha$ absorption makes them optically thick to radio emission through free-free absorption. Alternatively, in this and other JWST-discovered AGN, the nuclear magnetic field may have not developed properly yet, resulting both in intrinsically weak radio emission and also lack of hot corona, hence intrinsic X-ray weakness. Finally, we show that recently proposed scenarios, invoking hyper-dense and ultra-metal-poor outflows or Raman scattering to explain the broad H$\alpha$, are completely ruled out.

  We present JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy observations of the z ~ 9.11 lensed galaxy MACS1149-JD1, as part of the GA-NIFS programme. The data was obtained with both the G395H grating (R~ 2700) and the prism (R~ 100). This target shows a main elongated UV-bright clump and a secondary component detected in continuum emission at a projected distance of 2 kpc. The R2700 data trace the ionised-gas morpho-kinematics in between the two components, showing an elongated emission mainly traced by [O III]5007. We spatially resolve [O II]3726,3729, [O III]4959,5007, and [O III]4363, which enable us to map the electron density (ne ~ 1.0 x 103 cm-3), temperature (Te ~ 1.6 x 104 K), and direct-method gas-phase metallicity (-1.2 to -0.7 dex solar). A spatially resolved full-spectrum modelling of the prism indicates a north-south gas metallicity and stellar age gradient between the two components. We found 3-sigma evidence of a spatially resolved anti-correlation of the gas-phase metallicity and the star formation rate density, which is likely driven by gas inflows, enhancing the star formation in JD1. We employ high-z sensitive diagnostic diagrams to rule out the presence of a strong AGN in the main component. These findings show the unambiguous presence of two distinct stellar populations, with the majority of the mass ascribed to an old star formation burst, as suggested by previous works. We disfavour the possibility of a rotating-disc nature for MACS1149-JD1; we favour a merger event that has led to a recent burst of star formation in two separate regions, as supported by high values of [O III]5007/Hbeta, ionised gas velocity dispersion, and gas-phase metallicity.

  The study of starburst and AGN feedback is crucial for understanding the regulation of star formation and the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Arp 220, the closest ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG), is in an advanced phase of a major merger with two distinct nuclei, and shows evidence of multi-phase (molecular, ionised, neutral) and multi-scale (from &lt; 0.1 to &gt; 5 kpc) outflows. Therefore, it represents an ideal system for investigating outflow mechanisms and feedback phenomena in detail. Using new JWST NIRSpec IFU observations, we investigate the spatially resolved gaseous (in both ionized and hot molecular phases) and stellar kinematics in the innermost 1 kpc. We decouple the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting, identifying distinct multi-phase outflows associated with the two nuclei, with velocities up to $\sim$ 1000 km/s. We compute the mass ($\sim 10^7$ M$_\odot$), mass outflow rate ($\sim 20$ M$_\odot$/yr) and energetics ($\dot E_{out}\sim 10^{42}$ erg/s) for each outflow, finding that the ionized and hot molecular outflowing gas contribute around 2-30% to the total mass and the energy of the outflows, as inferred from the combination of multi-wavelength information. We discuss the possible origin of the outflows, finding no compelling evidence to prefer a starburst or AGN driven scenario. Regardless of their nature, outflows in Arp 220 propagate in multiple directions from parsec to kiloparsec scales, potentially impacting a significant portion of the host galaxy. This contrasts with isolated systems where outflows typically follow a more collimated path, and do not affect the interstellar medium throughout the entire galaxy. This study highlights the importance of investigating merging systems with multi-wavelength facilities, including JWST/NIRSpec IFS, to obtain a comprehensive understanding of feedback mechanisms in galaxy evolution.   

Inferring the iron K emissivity profiles of accretion discs irradiated

  One of the most promising methods to measure the spin of an accreting black hole is fitting the broad iron K$\alpha$ line in the X-ray spectrum. The line profile also depends on the geometry of the hard X-ray emitting corona. To put constraints on the black hole spin and corona geometry, it is essential to understand how do they affect the iron K$\alpha$ line emissivity profile. In this work, we present calculations of the illumination and the iron K$\alpha$ emissivity profiles performed with the Monte-Carlo GR radiative transfer code Monk. We focus on distinction between the illumination and emissivity profiles, which is in most previous studies neglected. We show that especially for the case of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs), the difference is very large. For active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the emissivity profile has a more similar shape as the illumination profile, but it is notably steeper in the innermost region within a few gravitational radii. We find out that the different behavior between AGN and black hole X-ray binary discs is due to the different energy spectra of the illuminating radiation. This suggests that the emissivity profile of the iron K$\alpha$ line cannot be determined by black hole spin and corona geometry alone and the energy spectrum of the illuminating radiation has to be taken into account. We also examined the effect of including the self-irradiation, and find it to be more important than the corona emission in BHXRBs.

  In this work, we explore the connection of three jetted $\gamma-$loud AGNs classes: Compact Steep-Spectrum Sources (CSS), Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1), and Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars, through the modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED). We selected two sources identified as CSS/NLS1 hybrids, PKS 2004-440 and 3C 286. Additionally, we included the source PKS 0440-00, initially classified as an FSRQ in the first Fermi-LAT catalog, but recently reclassified as an NLS1. We present the results of their broadband SED modeling using a one-zone leptonic synchrotron-self Compton (SSC)+external Compton (EC) model. By exploring the parameter space and investigating the disk-jet connection in these sources, we analyze their classification in a model-dependent way. Our findings reveal that modeling PKS 2004-447 at relatively large angles, as expected for CSS, results in an SSC-dominated inverse Compton emission. In contrast, at low observing angles, the inverse Compton emission is dominated by external photon fields. Both scenarios result in a jet with a low radiative power. For 3C 286 we found that using a one-zone model limits the jet viewing angle to $\sim7^{\circ}$, mainly due to its impact on the $\gamma$-ray emission. Our model results show a magnetically dominated jet, consistent with $\gamma$-CSS sources. Our results suggest that PKS 0440-00, can be classified as a powerful $\gamma-$NLS1, characterized by high accretion power and a jet dominated by bulk motion, similar to FSRQs.

  The feedback mechanisms triggered by supernova (SN) events and active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a central role in regulating the star formation and shaping galaxy properties. However, quantifying the impact and efficiency of these processes remains a challenge. In this study, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamics simulations to examine different models of SN and AGN feedback. Our goal is to investigate how variations in these processes impact the properties of simulated galaxy populations. Specifically, we focus on the analysis of effective yields, evaluating their capability to trace the effects of feedback processes on scaling relations. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between different feedback scenarios and the evolution of galaxies.
