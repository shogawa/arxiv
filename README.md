  We analyse VLBI and optical images of AGNs and their host galaxies and look for statistical correlations between the shape and orientation of the galaxy and the direction of the jet. We utilise the Astrogeo catalogue, which has over 9000 VLBI sources, many of those with a clear core-jet like structure that allows for the jet position angle to be reliably determined. We then use the VLBI source positions to search for optical counterparts within various optical surveys. In order to parameterise the orientation and shape of the host galaxy, we fitted a Gaussian elliptical model to the optical image, taking the PSF into account. We check our own shape parameters from this fit against the ones provided by the optical surveys. As of yet, no clear correlation between the galaxy morphology and the jet direction is seen.

  We analyze the physical properties of 8 X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) and one candidate protoquasar system (ADF22A1) in the $z = 3.09$ SSA22 protocluster by fitting their X-ray-to-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using our SED fitting code, Lightning. We recover star formation histories (SFH) for 7 of these systems which are well-fit by composite stellar population plus AGN models. We find indications that 4/9 of the SSA22 AGN systems we study have host galaxies below the main sequence, with $\rm SFR/SFR_{MS} \leq -0.4$. The remaining SSA22 systems, including ADF22A1, are consistent with obscured supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in star forming galaxies. We estimate the SMBH accretion rates and masses, and compare the properties and SFH of the 9 protocluster AGN systems with X-ray detected AGN candidates in the Chandra Deep Fields (CDF), finding that the distributions of SMBH growth rates, star formation rates, SMBH masses, and stellar masses for the protocluster AGN are consistent with field AGN. We constrain the ratio between the sample-averaged SSA22 SMBH mass and CDF SMBH mass to $&lt;1.41$. While the AGN are located near the density peaks of the protocluster, we find no statistically significant trends between the AGN or host galaxy properties and their location in the protocluster. We interpret the similarity of the protocluster and field AGN populations together with existing results as suggesting that the protocluster and field AGN co-evolve with their hosts in the same ways, while AGN-triggering events are more likely in the protocluster.

  We present a spatially-resolved study of the ionised gas in the central 2 kpc of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 2110 and investigate the role of its moderate luminosity radio jet (kinetic radio power of $P_\mathrm{jet} = 2.3 \times 10^{43}\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$). We use new optical integral-field observations taken with the MEGARA spectrograph at GTC. We fit the emission lines with a maximum of two Gaussian components, except at the AGN position where we used three. Aided by existing stellar kinematics, we use the observed velocity and velocity dispersion of the emission lines to classify the different kinematic components. The disc component is characterised by lines with $\sigma \sim 60-200\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The outflow component has typical values of $\sigma \sim 700\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ and is confined to the central 400 pc, which is coincident with linear part of the radio jet detected in NGC 2110. At the AGN position, the [O III]$\lambda$5007 line shows high velocity components reaching at least $1000\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. This and the high velocity dispersions indicate the presence of outflowing gas outside the galaxy plane. Spatially-resolved diagnostic diagrams reveal mostly LI(N)ER-like excitation in the outflow and some regions in the disc, which could be due to the presence of shocks. However, there is also Seyfert-like excitation beyond the bending of the radio jet, probably tracing the edge of the ionisation cone that intercepts with the disc of the galaxy. NGC 2110 follows well the observational trends between the outflow properties and the jet radio power found for a few nearby Seyfert galaxies. All these pieces of information suggest that part of observed ionised outflow in NGC 2110 might be driven by the radio jet. However, the radio jet was bent at radial distances of 200 pc (in projection) from the AGN, and beyond there, most of the gas in the galaxy disc is rotating.
