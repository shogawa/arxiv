  To understand the formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their co-evolution with host galaxies, it is essential to know the impact of environment on the activity of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present new Chandra X-ray observations of nuclear emission from member galaxies in the Antlia cluster, the nearest non-cool core and the nearest merging galaxy cluster, residing at D = 35.2 Mpc. Its inner region, centered on two dominant galaxies NGC 3268 and NGC 3258, has been mapped with three deep Chandra ACIS-I pointings. Nuclear X-ray sources are detected in 7/84 (8.3%) early-type galaxies (ETG) and 2/8 (25%) late-type galaxies with a median detection limit of 8x10^38 erg/s. All nuclear X-ray sources but one have a corresponding radio continuum source detected by MeerKAT at the L-band. Nuclear X-ray sources detected in early-type galaxies are considered as the genuine X-ray counterpart of low-luminosity AGN. When restricted to a detection limit of logLx(erg/s) &gt; 38.9 and a stellar mass of 10 &lt; log Ms(Msun) &lt;11.6, 6/11 (54.5%) ETG are found to contain an X-ray AGN in Antlia, exceeding the AGN occupation fraction of 7/39 (18.0%) and 2/12 (16.7%) in the more relaxed, cool core clusters, Virgo and Fornax, respectively, and rivaling that of the AMUSE-Field ETG of 27/49 (55.1%). Furthermore, more than half of the X-ray AGN in Antlia are hosted by its younger subcluster, centered on NGC 3258. We believe that this is because SMBH activity is enhanced in a dynamically young cluster compared to relatively relaxed clusters.

  Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are the loudest gravitational-wave (GW) sources in milli-Hertz (mHz) GW band, but their dynamical evolution may stall when the black holes reach the innermost parsec of a galaxy. Such a ``final-parsec problem'' could be solved if MBHB forms in a gas-rich environment, such as an active galactic nucleus (AGN), but other solutions not involving AGNs also exist. Testing the correlation between MBHBs and AGNs is difficult in real observation because AGNs are ubiquitous. To overcome this difficult, we use a statistical method, first designed to constrain the host galaxies of stellar-mass binary black holes, to search for the MBHB-AGN correlation in different scenarios. We find that by detecting only one MBHB at $z\lesssim0.5$, a mHz GW detector, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), can already distinguish different merger scenarios thanks to its ability of precisely localizing the source. Moreover, future detector networks and deeper AGNs surveys will allow us to testify the MBHB-AGN correlation up to a redshift of $z\sim 3$ even if only a small fraction of $20\%$ of MBHBs actually merge in AGNs. These constraints will help settle the long-standing debate on the possible solutions to the final-parsec problem.

  The MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) has observed 391 telescope pointings at L-band (900 - 1670 MHz) at $\delta\lesssim$ $+20\deg$. We present radio continuum images and a catalog of 495,325 (240,321) radio sources detected at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;$5 over an area of 2289 deg$^2$ (1132 deg$^2$) at 1006 MHz (1381 MHz). Every MALS pointing contains a central bright radio source ($S_{1\,\mathrm{GHz}} \gtrsim 0.2$ Jy). The median spatial resolution is $12^{\prime\prime}$ ($8^{\prime\prime}$). The median rms noise away from the pointing center is 25 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ (22 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$) and is within $\sim$ 15% of the achievable theoretical sensitivity. The flux density scale ratio and astrometric accuracy deduced from multiply observed sources in MALS are less than 1% (8% scatter) and $1^{\prime\prime}$, respectively. Through comparisons with NVSS and FIRST at 1.4 GHz, we establish the catalog's accuracy in the flux density scale and astrometry to be better than 6% (15% scatter) and $0.8^{\prime\prime}$, respectively. The median flux density offset is higher (9%) for an alternate beam model based on holographic measurements. The MALS radio source counts at 1.4 GHz are in agreement with literature. We estimate spectral indices ($\alpha$) of a subset of 125,621 sources (SNR$&gt;$8), confirm the flattening of spectral indices with decreasing flux density and identify 140 ultra steep-spectrum ($\alpha&lt;-1.3$) sources as prospective high-$z$ radio galaxies ($z&gt;2$). We have identified 1308 variable and 122 transient radio sources comprising primarily of AGN that demonstrate long-term (26 years) variability in their observed flux densities.

JWST CEERS &amp; JADES Active Galaxies at z = 4-7 Violate the Local

  JWST is revolutionizing our understanding of the high-z Universe by expanding the black hole horizon, looking farther and to smaller masses, and revealing the stellar light of their hosts. New detections of high-z systems offer unprecedented insights into the formation of the first black holes and their early co-evolution with galaxies. By examining JWST galaxies at z=4-7 that host H$\alpha$-detected black holes, we investigate (i) the high-z $M_\bullet-M_\star$ relation and (ii) the black hole mass distribution, especially in its low-mass range ($M_\bullet\lesssim10^{6.5} M_\odot$). With a detailed statistical analysis, our findings conclusively reveal a high-z $M_\bullet-M_\star$ relation that deviates at $&gt;3\sigma$ confidence level from the local relation: $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot) = -2.38^{+0.82}_{-0.83}+1.06^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\log(M_\star/M_\odot)$. Black holes are overmassive by $\sim10-100\times$ compared to their local counterparts in similar galactic hosts. This fact is not due to a selection effect in surveys. Moreover, our analysis predicts the possibility of detecting in high-z JWST surveys $5-18\times$ more black holes with $M_\bullet\lesssim10^{6.5} M_\odot$, and $10-30\times$ more with $M_\bullet \lesssim 10^{8.5} M_\odot$, compared to local relation's predictions. The lighter black holes preferentially occupy galaxies with a stellar mass of $\sim 10^{7.5}-10^8 M_\odot$. We have yet to detect these sources because (i) they may be inactive (duty cycles 1%-10%), (ii) the host overshines the AGN, or (iii) the AGN is obscured and not immediately recognizable by line diagnostics. A search of low-mass black holes in existing JWST surveys will further test the $M_\bullet-M_\star$ relation. Current JWST fields represent a treasure trove of black hole systems at z=4-7; their detection will provide crucial insights into their early evolution and co-evolution with their galactic hosts.

  We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies at $z\gtrsim9$ found behind the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury Program. We confirm the source redshift via emission lines and/or the Ly$\alpha$ break feature for ten galaxies at z=8.50-13.08 down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17.3$. We achieve a high confirmation rate of 100\% for $z&gt;9$ candidates reported in Atek et al. (2023). Using six sources with multiple emission line detections, we find that the offset of the redshift estimates between the lines and the Ly$\alpha$ break alone with prism can be as large as $\pm0.2$, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources. With spec-$z$ confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at $z\simeq9$-12 and find these lower limits to be consistent with recent photometric measurements. We identify at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) systems based on X-ray emission, broad line (BL) H$\beta$, high ionization line (e.g., NIV]1487, CIV1549) detections, and excess in UVLF. This requires the AGN LFs at $z\simeq$ 9-10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated at $z\sim6$ and indicates a plausible cause of the high abundance of $z&gt;9$ galaxies claimed in recent photometric studies may be AGNs. One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a dusty BL AGN at $z=8.50$ with a physical separation of 380 kpc in the source plane. These two sources show blueward Ly$\alpha$ line or continuum emission, suggesting that they reside in the same ionized bubble with a radius of $7.69\pm0.18$ pMpc. Our results imply that AGNs have a non-negligible contribution to cosmic reionization.
