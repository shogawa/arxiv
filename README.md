  Observations of large amount of massive galaxies with relatively old populations found at high redshifts are challenging galaxy formation scenarios within standard cosmology. Precise determinations of the average age of these galaxies would be useful for the discussion of this problem. Here we carry out a better constraint of the age of 200 V-shaped SED non-AGN galaxies at redshifts $2&lt;z&lt;4$ of the catalog of FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey, identified by V-shape in their spectral energy distribution (SED) with a Lyman and a Balmer break. SED fitting include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and extinction. The galaxies are younger at higher redshift on average. However, for the galaxies with $z&gt;2.5$, we do not see a significant evolution of their average age, with all average ages of galaxies mostly remaining between 1 and 2 Gyr. Our research find that most massive galaxies ($\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$ ) are older (typically $&gt;\sim 1$ Gyr old) and formed earlier than less massive galaxies in our sample.

  This white paper discusses the breadth of science related to active galactic nuclei (AGN) and associated phenomena to be enabled by a mission with microcalorimeter energy resolution in the soft X-ray band, a large collecting area, and wide-field imaging. Such a mission, the Line Emission Mapper (LEM), has been proposed to NASA's 2023 Astrophysics Probe Explorer call. While the science pillars of the PI-led part of the mission focus on galaxy evolution, the PI-led LEM All-Sky Survey (LASS) and General Observer/Investigator opportunities will enable vital discoveries for AGN science in the critical soft X-ray band.

  We searched the Chandra and XMM archives for observations of 900 green pea galaxies to find AGN signatures. Green peas are low-mass galaxies with prominent emission lines, similar in size and star formation rate to high-redshift dwarf galaxies. Of the 29 observations found, 9 show X-ray detections with $S/N&gt;3$. The 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity for these 9 sources exceeds $10^{40}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$, with 2 sources exceeding $10^{41}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$, suggesting the presence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH) or low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) with BH masses between $100-10^6M_\mathrm{\odot}$. All X-ray detected sources (plus 6 additional sources) show He~II$\lambda4686$ emission and a broad component of the H$\alpha$ emission line, indicating winds. The line widths of the broad H$\alpha$ and He II$\lambda4686$ emitting gas clouds are weakly correlated ($R^{2}=0.15$), suggesting He II$\lambda4686$ emission is inconsistent with winds from super-Eddington accretors. However, the ratio of X-ray luminosity to star formation rate shows an anti-correlation with metallicity in 5 out of 9 X-ray detected sources, implying ultraluminous X-ray sources are key contributors to the observed X-ray luminosity. This could be due to super-Eddington accretors or IMBH. The X-ray emission is much higher than that produced by Wolf-Rayet stars and supernovae-driven winds. Thus, the X-ray luminosity in these 9 sources can only be explained by black holes with masses over $100~M_\mathrm{\odot}$. Our findings suggest the presence of LLAGN in these galaxies, with broad H$\alpha$ line widths implying BH masses of $10^4-10^6M_\mathrm{\odot}$. Given Green Peas' role as significant Lyman Continuum leakers, LLAGN in these galaxies could have contributed significantly to cosmic reionization.

  Deep surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an emergent population of moderate-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 4&lt; z&lt; 14 powered by accretion onto early massive black holes. The high number densities reported, together with the large Lyman-continuum (LyC) production efficiency and leakiness into the intergalactic medium (IGM) that are typical of UV-selected AGNs, lead us to reassess a scenario where AGNs are the sole drivers of the cosmic hydrogen/helium reionization process. Our approach is based on the assumptions, grounded in recent observations, that: (a) the fraction of broad-line AGNs among galaxies is around 10-15%; (b) the mean escape fraction of hydrogen LyC radiation is high, &gt;80%, in AGN hosts and is negligible otherwise; and (c) internal absorption at 4 ryd or a steep ionizing EUV spectrum delay full reionization of HeII until z~2.8-3.0, in agreement with observations of the HeII Lyman-alpha forest. In our fiducial models: 1) hydrogen reionization is 99% completed by redshift z~5.3-5.5, and reaches its midpoint at z~6.5-6.7; (2) the integrated Thomson scattering optical depth to reionization is ~0.05, consistent with constraints from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data; and (3) the abundant AGN population detected by JWST does not violate constraints on the unresolved X-ray background.
