  We study the co-evolution of black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies in the ASTRID and Illustris-TNG300 cosmological simulations and the Dark Sage Semi-Analytic Model (SAM), focusing on the evolution of the BH mass - stellar mass ($M_{\rm BH}-M_*$) relation. Due to differences in the adopted sub-grid modeling of BH seeding, dynamics, and feedback, the models differ in their predicted redshift evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relation. We find that it is the interplay between the star formation rate (SFR) and the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) which drives the evolution of the mean relation. We define a quantity $\mathcal{R}$, the ratio between the specific BHAR and SFR (i.e. $\mathcal{R} \equiv\ $sBHAR/sSFR), and demonstrate that it is $\mathcal{R}$ that governs the evolution of individual sources in the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ plane. The efficiency of BH growth versus stellar mass growth in the sSFR-sBHAR plane reflects the partitioning of gas between fueling star formation versus BH accretion. This partitioning depends on the implementation of BH dynamics and the nature of how AGN feedback quenches galaxies. In the cosmological simulations (ASTRID and Illustris-TNG300), the BHAR and SFR are intrinsically linked, resulting in a tight $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ correlation, while the Dark Sage SAM produces a significantly larger scatter. We discuss these results in the context of recently discovered over-massive BHs and massive quenched galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope.

  Fast, massive winds are ubiquitously observed in the UV and X-ray spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and other accreting sources. Theoretical and observational evidences suggest they are launched at accretion disc scales, carrying significant mass and angular momentum. Thanks to such high energy output, they may play an important role in transferring the accretion energy to the surrounding environment. In the case of AGNs, this process can help setting the so-called coevolution between the AGN and its host galaxy. To precisely assess the effective role of these winds, it is necessary to accurately measure their properties, including mass and energy rates. We aim to maximise the scientific return of current and future observations by improving the theoretical modelling of these winds through our Winds in the Ionised Nuclear Environment (WINE) model. WINE is a spectroscopic model designed for disc winds in AGNs and compact accreting sources, which couples photoionisation and radiative transfer with special relativistic effects and a three-dimensional model of the emission profiles. We explore with WINE the main spectral features associated to AGN disc winds, with particular emphasis on the detectability of the wind emission. We simulate observations with the X-ray microcalorimeters Resolve on board the XRISM satellite and the future Athena's X-IFU for the typical properties and exposure times of the sources in the XRISM Performance Verification phase. The wind kinematic, geometry, ionisation and column density deeply affect shape and strength of the spectral features. Thanks to this, both Resolve and X-IFU will be able to accurately constrain the main properties of disc winds in a broad range of parameters. We also find a dramatic difference in the gas opacity when using a soft, Narrow Line Seyfert 1-like SED compared to a canonical powerlaw SED with spectral index Gamma=2.
