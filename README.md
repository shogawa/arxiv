The amplification of magnetic fields in black hole accretion flows governs key high-energy phenomena such as magnetically arrested disks and relativistic jets. We develop a semi-analytical general relativistic framework that extends classical compressional amplification models by incorporating rotational shear, and apply it to large-scale poloidal magnetic field evolution in accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. By parameterizing the azimuthal velocity as a fraction of the Keplerian value ($ξ\in [0,1]$), from purely radial infall ($ξ=0$) to Keplerian rotation ($ξ=1$), we examine the combined effects of radial compression and shear. Purely radial flows maximize amplification of both $B_r$ and $B_θ$ due to strong compression. In rotating flows, a distinct dichotomy emerges: sub-Keplerian regimes ($ξ&lt;1$) preferentially enhance $B_r$, whereas Keplerian rotation strengthens $B_θ$ via shear. The transition from subsonic outer regions to supersonic relativistic inner regions further accelerates magnetic growth, revealing effects absent in earlier analytical treatments. These results show that rotational support controls both amplification efficiency and magnetic geometry, with sub-Keplerian phases particularly favorable for advecting the radial flux required for MAD formation. This work provides an analytical bridge between classical accretion theory and modern GRMHD simulations, with implications for X-ray binaries, AGNs, and EHT-scale systems.

The quenching of star formation is a crucial phase in galaxy evolution. Although active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been proposed as a key driver of this transition, the lack of strong AGN in nearby quenching galaxies raises questions about its effectiveness. In this study, we investigate AGN activity in post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z&lt;$ 0.2, using multiwavelength data from eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio). We assess AGN incidence and strength across different stages and apply stacking techniques to undetected galaxies to recover average AGN properties. Comparisons between observed luminosity and that expected from star formation (L$_{\rm obs}$/L$_{\rm SF}$) show that PSBs are consistent with star formation dominating their radio and X-ray emission. Although PSBs exhibit a MIR AGN incidence rate twice that of SFGs, their estimated AGN luminosities are small compared to those of MIR AGN in the literature. PSBs overall do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs. While the presence of obscured, low-luminosity AGN in PSBs cannot be excluded, such AGN, if present, could be fueled by residual gas from the preceding starburst and may not play a dominant role in quenching. Our findings suggest that AGN's role in quenching at low redshift is more subtle than violently removing the gas -- the feedback is likely more "preventive" than "ejective".

The satellite system of Centaurus A presents a curious cosmological puzzle: while the global population is consistent with theoretical expectations, its inner regions (d&lt;150 kpc) exhibit a deficit of luminous satellite galaxies. Using the Galacticus semi-analytic model applied to high-resolution N-body merger trees, we investigate potential quenching mechanisms to explain this trend. Our fiducial models, calibrated to the Milky Way, reproduce the overall Cen A population but overpredict the number of bright inner-halo satellites by a factor of 4 +- 1 at Mv &lt; -15.8. We find that this is not due to statistical variance. Instead, the spatial coincidence of this deficiency with Cen A's massive, kiloparsec-scale radio lobes suggests a powerful environmental driver. We explore a range of physical scenarios, including enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion into halos from the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results indicate that AGN-driven thermal feedback at z &lt; 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, effectively truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function. Our work suggests that the "Curious Case of Centaurus A" may provide evidence of AGN feedback within the host galaxy that regulates the survival and evolution of its dwarf galaxy satellites.

We present a multi-wavelength study of nuclear outflows in the nearby dwarf Seyfert galaxy NGC~4395, which hosts an intermediate-mass black hole. Using \textit{JWST}/NIRSpec and MIRI IFU spectroscopy (1.66--28.6~$μ$m), together with ALMA and Gemini/GMOS data, we probe the ionised and molecular gas on parsec scales. The JWST nuclear spectra reveal 134 emission lines, including H\,\textsc{i}, He, numerous fine-structure lines, H$_2$ rotational/ro-vibrational transitions, and several PAH bands. Modelling of the H$_2$ rotational lines reveals three warm/hot molecular components ($T\!\approx\!580$, 1480, and 2900~K), along with a cold ($&lt;50$~K) phase traced by ALMA CO(2--1). Outflow signatures are detected in cold and warm/hot molecular gas, in H\,\textsc{i}, and in 36 fine-structure lines spanning ionisation potentials of 7.6--300~eV. Ionised outflow velocities range from 127 to 716~km\,s$^{-1}$, with blueshifted and redshifted components consistent with a stratified biconical geometry. The cold molecular gas shows a mass outflow rate nearly 1--2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the warm/hot molecular and ionised phases. The kinetic coupling efficiency is 0.003--0.12\% for the coronal-line gas and 0.4--1.4\% for the H\,\textsc{i} outflow, indicating that only the low-ionisation gas significantly impacts the surrounding ISM. Outflow velocity and the fraction of flux in the outflowing component increase with ionisation potential, implying that the most highly ionised gas originates closest to the AGN and is most efficiently accelerated.
