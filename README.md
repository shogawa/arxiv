  Spectropolarimetry is a powerful tool to investigate the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as polarization signatures are key to probing magnetic field structure, evolution, and the physics of particle acceleration in jets. Optical linear polarization of blazars is typically greater than a few percent, indicating the emission is dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation, while polarization less than a few percent is common for other type 1 AGNs. We present a spectropolarimetric study of PKS 0637-75 and PKS 1510-089 to determine how the head-on orientation of a jet and dominant emission processes influence polarimetric variations in the broad lines and continuum. Observations were obtained biweekly from the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on the Southern African Large Telescope. Variability in the continuum polarization is detected for both PKS 0637-75 and PKS 1510-089, with a total average level of 2.5% +/- 0.1% and 7.5% +/- 0.1%, respectively. There is no clear polarization in the broad Balmer emission lines and weak polarization in Mg II as the average level across all observations is 0.2% +/- 0.1% for Hbeta, 0.2% +/- 0.3% for Hgamma, and 0.6% +/- 0.2% for Mg II. We find that polarization measurements confirm the conclusions drawn from spectral energy distribution modeling of the disk-jet contributions to the emission as optical polarization and time variability for PKS 0637-75 are shown to be dominated by accretion disk emission while those of PKS 1510-089 are due to both disk and jet emission, with greater jet contribution during flaring states.

  We introduce an improved method for decomposing the emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies using templates from principal component analysis (PCA). This approach integrates prior information from PCA with a penalized pixel fitting mechanism which improves the precision and effectiveness of the decomposition process. Specifically, we have reduced the degeneracy and over-fitting in AGN-host decomposition, particularly for those with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), where traditional methods tend to fail. By applying our method to 76,565 SDSS Data Release 16 quasars with $z&lt;0.8$, we achieve a success rate of $\approx$ 94%, thus establishing the largest host-decomposed spectral catalog of quasars to date. Our fitting results consider the impact of the host galaxy on the overestimation of the AGN luminosity and black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$). Furthermore, we obtained stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_*$) measurements for 4,137 quasars. The slope of the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation in this subsample is generally consistent with previous quasar studies beyond the local universe. Our method provides a robust and efficient approach to disentangle the AGN and host galaxy components across a wide range of SNRs and redshifts.

  We present the results of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations taken as part of the ongoing, intensive multi-wavelength monitoring program of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 by the AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (AGN STORM 2) Project. The campaign revealed an unexpected and transient obscuring outflow, never before seen in this source. Of our four XMM-Newton/NuSTAR epochs, one fortuitously taken during a bright X-ray state has strong narrow absorption lines in the high-resolution grating spectra. From these absorption features, we determine that the obscurer is in fact a multi-phase ionized wind with an outflow velocity of $\sim$5200 km s$^{-1}$, and for the first time find evidence for a lower ionization component with the same velocity observed in absorption features in the contemporaneous HST spectra. This indicates that the UV absorption troughs may be due to dense clumps embedded in diffuse, higher ionization gas responsible for the X-ray absorption lines of the same velocity. We observe variability in the shape of the absorption lines on timescales of hours, placing the variable component at roughly 1000 $R_g$ if attributed to transverse motion along the line of sight. This estimate aligns with independent UV measurements of the distance to the obscurer suggesting an accretion disk wind at the inner broad line region. We estimate that it takes roughly 200 days for the outflow to travel from the disk to our line of sight, consistent with the timescale of the outflow's column density variations throughout the campaign.
