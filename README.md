  We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.

  We present the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) catalog from the fourth data release (HDR4) of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment Survey (HETDEX). HETDEX is an untargeted spectroscopic survey. HDR4 contains 345,874 Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations from January 2017 to August 2023 covering an effective area of 62.9 deg2. With no imaging pre-selection, our spectroscopic confirmed AGN sample includes low-luminosity AGN, narrow-line AGN, and/or red AGN down to g~25. This catalog has 15,940 AGN across the redshifts of z=0.1~4.6, giving a raw AGN number density of 253.4 deg-2. Among them, 10,499 (66%) have redshifts either confirmed by line pairs or matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Catalog. For the remaining 5,441 AGN, 2,083 are single broad line AGN candidates, while the remaining 3,358 are single intermediate broad line (full width at half maximum, FWHM ~ 1200 km s-1) AGN candidates. A total of 4,060 (39%) of the 10,499 redshift-confirmed AGN have emission-line regions $3\sigma$ more extended than the image quality which could be strong outflows blowing into the outskirts of the host galaxies or ionized intergalactic medium.

  Aims. In this paper, we searched for multi-wavelength (X-ray, optical and radio) counterparts to the unassociated gamma-ray sources (UGS) of the Fermi 4FGL-DR4 catalog. The main goal is to identify new blazars and/or new active galactic nuclei (AGNs) emitting at GeV energies [like (Narrow Line) Seyfert-1 and radio galaxies]. Methods. We focus on sky regions observed by the Swift satellite that overlap with the reported positions of the UGSs. Since our primary interest lies in extra-galactic sources, we focus on UGSs located outside the Galactic plane (|b| &gt; 10$^{\circ}$). Due to the large number of sources (about 1800 UGS), we developed a pipeline to automatise the search for counterparts and significantly reduce the computational time for the analysis. Our association process begins by identifying potential X-ray counterparts for each UGS; if one is found, we further look for corresponding radio and optical counterparts in the X-ray counterpart error box, thus minimizing ambiguities. Results. Out of the 1284 UGSs in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, 714 were observed at least once by Swift/XRT. We detected, with a significance of $\geq$ 3$\sigma$, at least one X-ray source within the Fermi error box for 274 of these $\gamma$-ray emitters. Among these, 193 UGSs have a single potential X-ray counterpart (referred to as UGS1), while 81 have multiple potential X-ray counterparts within the Fermi error box (referred to as UGS2). Of the UGS2, 54 have two X-ray counterparts, 11 have three, and the remaining 16 have more than three. Each UGS1 has an optical counterpart, and 113 also could be associated to a radio counterpart. We performed a comparison of the possible counterpart properties with those of the $\gamma$-ray emitters identified by Fermi, with the aim to assess the goodness of our associations.

  This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the influence of radial behavior of disk outflow on the structure and dynamics of the broad line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with the emphasis on how the mass ejection rate contribute in shaping the broad emission line profiles. Specifically, we analyze how varying the radial efficiency of mass loss from accretion disks, driven by radiative dust-based mechanisms, contribute to the distribution of material in the BLR. By exploring different radial scenarios of disk mass loss behavior, we uncover connections between outflow radial efficiency and emission line profiles, particularly for lowly ionized lines. Our findings reveal that while the observed shape of broad emission lines is partially influenced by the radial behavior of the disk outflow, it ultimately depends more critically on the physical conditions of the clouds and the specific approach adopted to the emissivity for their contribution to the line formation.
