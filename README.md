  Galaxy mergers and interactions have long been suggested as a significant driver of galaxy evolution. However, the exact extent to which mergers enhance star formation and AGN activity has been challenging to establish observationally. In previous work, we visually classified a sample of galaxies with various types of faint tidal features in DECaLS images. In this paper, we cross-correlate this sample with a principal component analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to investigate how the presence of these features, as well as their specific nature, correlates with intense star formation and AGN activity. Averaged over all tidal classes, we find that tidal feature galaxies are 10.3$\pm$1.5 times more likely to be in a starburst phase, and 24.3$\pm$5.0 times more likely to have rapidly quenched (post-starbursts), than those in a mass-matched control sample. Examining differences between tidal classes, galaxies with \textit{arm} features are 1.4$\pm$0.2 times more likely to be starbursting than the other categories, while those with \textit{shell} features are 2.7$\pm$0.6 times more likely to be in a quiescent state. In a similar analysis, we identify which galaxies show evidence of AGN activity and find no significant difference between the fraction of those with or without tidal features. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that mergers play an important role in driving star formation and rapid quenching in galaxies, and provide some of the first empirical evidence that the strength of this effect has a dependence on the detailed nature of the interaction, as traced by the tidal feature morphology.

  We present a spectroscopic analysis of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) selected as little red dot at $z = 5.3$ behind the Bullet cluster (Bz5.3), based on JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. The detection of strong FeII, OI, and CaII triplet emission lines, along with the evidence of broad Balmer lines, provides unambiguous evidence of a broad-line region (BLR) and an accreting supermassive black hole. Notably, we report the first detection of the $\lambda1304$ bump (i.e., blend of OI$\lambda$1304 and SiII) at high redshift, a feature commonly seen in local AGNs but not yet reported in the early Universe. The OI$\lambda$1304/$\lambda8446$ photon ratio is highly suppressed (0.1-0.3), implying significant internal dust extinction, with estimated dust attenuation $A_V \sim 0.4$-$1.0$. We identify Ly$\beta$ fluorescence as the dominant excitation mechanism of the low-ionization lines, with additional contributions from collisional excitation. High OI$\lambda$8446 equivalent width and weak OI$\lambda$7774 support this interpretation. The detection of iron emission, whether from broad permitted or narrow forbidden lines, supports the presence of a stratified BLR, as also recently proposed in local LRDs. Photoionization modeling of OI$\lambda$8446 and CaII further suggests the coexistence of multiple gas phases with distinct densities and ionization states, highlighting the complexity of the BLR. Bz5.3 thus offers a rare window into early AGN activity and BLR physics at early times.

  Modern sky surveys produce vast amounts of observational data, making the application of classical methods for estimating galaxy properties challenging and time-consuming. This challenge can be significantly alleviated by employing automatic machine and deep learning techniques. We propose an implementation of the ULISSE algorithm aimed at determining physical parameters of galaxies, in particular star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses ($M_{\ast}$), using only composite-color images. ULISSE is able to rapidly and efficiently identify candidates from a single image based on photometric and morphological similarities to a given reference object with known properties. This approach leverages features extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform similarity searches among all objects in the sample, eliminating the need for extensive neural network training. Our experiments, performed on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, demonstrate that we are able to predict the joint star formation rate and stellar mass of the target galaxies within 1 dex in 60% to 80% of cases, depending on the investigated subsample (quiescent/star-forming galaxies, early-/late-type, etc.), and within 0.5 dex if we consider these parameters separately. This is approximately twice the fraction obtained from a random guess extracted from the parent population. Additionally, we find ULISSE is more effective for galaxies with active star formation compared to elliptical galaxies with quenched star formation. Additionally, ULISSE performs more efficiently for galaxies with bright nuclei such as AGN. Our results suggest that ULISSE is a promising tool for a preliminary estimation of star-formation rates and stellar masses for galaxies based only on single images in current and future wide-field surveys (e.g., Euclid, LSST), which target millions of sources nightly.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit stochastic variability across a wide range of timescales and wavelengths. AGN flares are extreme outbursts that deviate from this typical behavior and may trace a range of energetic physical processes. Using six years of data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 23, we conduct a systematic search for AGN flares among a sample of well-sampled AGNs and AGN candidates. We construct two catalogs: the AGN Flare Coarse Catalog (AGNFCC), containing 28,504 flares identified via Bayesian blocks and Gaussian Processes, and the AGN Flare Refined Catalog (AGNFRC), comprising 1,984 high-confidence flares selected using stricter criteria. We analyze their spatial distribution, temporal characteristics, host AGN type and potential origins. Some flares can be associated with known supernovae, tidal disruption events, or blazars, and a few may be linked to binary black hole mergers or microlensing events. These catalogs provide a valuable resource for studying transient phenomena in AGNs and are publicly available at https://github.com/Lyle0831/AGN-Flares.

  The Perseus cluster (Abell 426) is a nearby massive galaxy cluster that spans several degrees. We combined SRG/eROSITA, XMM-Newton, and Chandra data to get a complete coverage of this cluster in X-rays up to $R_{\rm 200c}$ and beyond, although at the largest radii, spatial non-uniformities of X-ray background and foreground dominate. While the Perseus central part represents a canonical cool-core structure with clear signs of AGN Feedback, the outskirts, in turn, serve as a convincing example of a merger-perturbed system. X-ray data suggest that IC310 is the main galaxy of a subcluster that merges with Perseus over the past $\sim 4\,{\rm Gyr}$. Overall, this configuration resembles the merger between the Coma cluster and the NGC4839 group. It is statistically more likely to find a merging group near the apocenter of its orbit. Therefore, it is not surprising that IC310 in Perseus has a relatively small velocity relative to the main cluster, similarly to NGC4839 in Coma.   Perseus also hosts a high-velocity radio galaxy, NGC1265 (line-of-sight velocity is almost twice the virial velocity of the main cluster), which is known for its spectacular radio tail. Unless this galaxy has been accelerated by a time-variable potential associated with the merger, it has to move almost along the line of sight through the entire cluster, which would be a rare, but not a truly exceptional configuration. Both galaxies, IC310 and NGC1265, have remarkable radio tails with sharp bends that are reminiscent of a "snake biting its tail". We speculate that these curious shapes are natural consequences of their (different) orbits in Perseus. For IC310, the proximity to the apocenter and the reversal of its radial velocity might play a role. For NGC1265, the nearly line-of-sight motion coupled with the gas motions in the merging system might be important.

  We investigate the synchrotron emission signatures of shocks driven by active galactic nucleus (AGN) wind in elliptical galaxies based on our two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic $\textit{MACER}$ numerical simulations. Using these simulation data, we calculate the synchrotron radiation produced by nonthermal electrons accelerated at shocks, adopting reasonable assumptions for the magnetic field and relativistic electron distribution (derived from diffusive shock acceleration theory), and predict the resulting observational signatures. In our fiducial model, shocks driven by AGN winds produce synchrotron emission with luminosities of approximately $10^{29}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}$ in the radio band (0.5-5 GHz), with spectral indices of $\alpha \approx -0.4$ to $-0.6$ during the strongest shock phases, gradually steepening to about $-0.8$ to $-1.4$ as the electron population ages. Spatially, the emission is initially concentrated in regions of strong shocks, later expanding into more extended, diffuse structures. We also apply our model to the dwarf elliptical galaxy Messier 32 (M32), and find remarkable consistency between our simulated emission and the observed nuclear radio source, suggesting that this radio component likely originates from hot-wind-driven shocks. Our results indicate that AGN winds not only influence galaxy gas dynamics through mechanical energy input but also yield direct observational evidence via nonthermal radiation. With the advent of next-generation radio facilities such as the FAST Core Array, SKA, and ngVLA, these emission signatures will serve as important probes for detecting and characterizing AGN feedback.

  The CGM around unobscured AGN has received much attention in recent years. Comparatively, nebulae associated with obscured AGN are less studied. Here, we simulate the Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and HeII nebulae around the two types of AGN at $z=2-3$ with ten massive systems from the FIRE simulations based on the unified model to show their differences and to test if they can be used to constrain the AGN model. We post-process the data with the CLOUDY and the Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer code, RASCAS. Overall, we find that the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around the unobscured AGN (type-I nebulae) and obscured AGN (type-II nebulae) do not exhibit significant differences in the luminosity, area, and HeII/Ly$\alpha$ when the simulated cutout is set to the halo virial radius. Whereas, the type-II nebulae exhibit less symmetric morphologies, flatter surface brightness profiles, and larger emission line widths (at $R\geq 10$ kpc) than those of the type-I nebulae. These nebulae properties exhibit complicated correlations with the AGN, indicating that nebulae observations can be applied to constrain the AGN engine. However, independent observations on nebulae in the mentioned emissions are insufficient to test the unified model as a priori in observations is not possible to know the direction and opening angle of the ionization cone. We prompt that the joint observations of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae and radio jets can help to reveal the ionization cone to probe the unified model. Our calculations suggest that this method requires $\geq 75$ type-II Ly$\alpha$ nebulae with current instruments to reach a confidence level of $\geq 95\%$.

  Over the past few years \textit{JWST} has been a major workhorse in detecting and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium. In this work, we present new deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z11-1, a galaxy at z = 11.28, in which we report the detection of multiple rest-frame UV and optical emission lines: CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,09, CIV]$\lambda\lambda$1548,51, [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,29, [NeIII]$\lambda$3869, H$\gamma$ and tentative evidence for HeII$\lambda$1640. The ionisation properties of GS-z11-1 are consistent with star formation, with potential contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate a galaxy stellar mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.8$\pm$0.2 and log(SFR/(M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$))= 0.32$\pm$0.11 for the fiducial SF-only models. We measured C/O from the SED modelling of C/O = 1.20$\pm0.15 \times$ solar. This is one of the highest C/O abundances at z$&gt;$10, and it is consistent with either PopII and PopIII enrichment paths. Despite this source being extremely compact, with a half-light radius of 73$\pm$10 pc, we see no increased equivalent width of NIV] and NIII] emission lines as seen in some other compact sources at similar redshifts, a potential signature of second-generation stars in GCs. Overall, this galaxy exhibits low metallicity and high ionisation parameter consistent with intense star-formation or AGN activity in the early Universe, possibly observed before the enrichment by the second generation of stars in proto-globular clusters in the core of the galaxy.
