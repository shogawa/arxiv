  Deep observations with JWST have revealed an emerging population of red point-like sources that could provide a link between the postulated supermassive black hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work we present a JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey, of a massive accreting black hole at $z=8.50$, displaying a clear broad-line component as inferred from the H$\beta$ line with FWHM = $3439\pm413$ km s$^{-1}$, typical of the broad line region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines, and a point-source morphology. We compute the black hole mass of log$_{10}(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)=8.17\pm0.42$, and a bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol}\sim6.6\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These values imply that our object is accreting at $\sim 40\%$ of the Eddington limit. Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA, indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of log$_{10}(M_{\rm *}/M_\odot)&lt;8.7$, which would lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at least $\sim 30 \%$. This is orders of magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs, but is consistent with recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding suggests that a non-negligible fraction of supermassive black holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted number densities of high-$z$ faint AGN, future NIRSpec observations of larger samples will allow us to further investigate the galaxy-black hole co-evolution in the early Universe.

  We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies at $z\gtrsim9$ found behind the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury Program. We confirm the source redshift via emission lines and/or the Ly$\alpha$ break feature for ten galaxies at z=8.50-13.08 down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17.3$. We achieve a high confirmation rate of 100\% for $z&gt;9$ candidates reported in Atek et al. (2023). Using six sources with multiple emission line detections, we find that the offset of the redshift estimates between the lines and the Ly$\alpha$ break alone with prism can be as large as $\pm0.2$, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources. With spec-$z$ confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at $z\simeq9$-12 and find these lower limits to be consistent with recent photometric measurements. We identify at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) systems based on X-ray emission, broad line (BL) H$\beta$, high ionization line (e.g., NIV]1487, CIV1549) detections, and excess in UVLF. This requires the AGN LFs at $z\simeq$ 9-10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated at $z\sim6$ and indicates a plausible cause of the high abundance of $z&gt;9$ galaxies claimed in recent photometric studies may be AGNs. One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a dusty BL AGN at $z=8.50$ with a physical separation of 380 kpc in the source plane. These two sources show blueward Ly$\alpha$ line or continuum emission, suggesting that they reside in the same ionized bubble with a radius of $7.56\pm0.10$ pMpc. Our results imply that AGNs have a non-negligible contribution to cosmic reionization.

  Correlated variability between coronal X-rays and disc optical/UV photons provides a very useful diagnostic of the interplay between the different regions around an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and how they interact. AGN that reveal strong X-ray reflection in their spectra should normally exhibit optical/UV to X-ray correlation consistent with reprocessing -- where the optical/UV emission lag behind the X-rays. While such correlated delay has been seen in some sources, it has been absent in others. \rm{Mrk~1044} is one such source that has been known to reveal strong X-ray reflection in its spectra. In our analysis of three long \textit{XMM-Newton} and several \textit{Swift} observations of the source, we found no strong evidence for correlation between its UV and X-ray lightcurves both on short and long time scales. Among other plausible causes for the non-detection, we posit that higher X-ray variability than UV and strong general relativistic effects close to the black hole may also be responsible. We also present results from the spectral analysis based on \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations, which show the strong soft X-ray excess and iron K$\alpha$ line in the 0.3--50 keV spectrum that can be described by relativistic reflection.

  The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a selected Small Explorer (SMEX) mission launching in 2027. It consists of a large field-of-view Compton telescope that will probe with increased sensitivity the under-explored MeV gamma-ray sky (0.2-5 MeV). We will present the current status of cosipy, a Python library that will perform spectral and polarization fits, image deconvolution, and all high-level analysis tasks required by COSI's broad science goals: uncovering the origin of the Galactic positrons, mapping the sites of Galactic nucleosynthesis, improving our models of the jet and emission mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and detecting and localizing gravitational wave and neutrino sources. The cosipy library builds on the experience gained during the COSI balloon campaigns and will bring the analysis of data in the Compton regime to a modern open-source likelihood-based code, capable of performing coherent joint fits with other instruments using the Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML). In this contribution, we will also discuss our plans to receive feedback from the community by having yearly software releases accompanied by publicly-available data challenges.

  We analyze the cool gas in and around 14 nearby galaxies (at $z$$&lt;$0.1) mapped with the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey by measuring absorption lines produced by gas in spectra of background quasars/AGN at impact parameters of 0-25 effective radii from the galaxy center. Using HST/COS, we detect absorption at the galaxy redshift and measure or constrain column densities of neutral (H I, N I, O I, Ar I), low-ionization (Si II, S II, C II, N II Fe II), and high-ionization (Si III, Fe III, N V, O VI) species for 11 galaxies. We derive the ionization parameter and ionization-corrected metallicity using CLOUDY photo-ionization models. The H I column density ranges from $\sim$$10^{13}$ to $\sim$$10^{20}\,{\rm cm^{-2}}$ and decreases with impact parameter for $r \ge R_{e}$. Galaxies with higher stellar mass have weaker H I absorption. Comparing absorption velocities with MaNGA radial velocity maps of ionized gas line emissions in galactic disks, we find that the neutral gas seen in absorption co-rotates with the disk out to $\sim$10 $R_{e}$. Sight lines with lower elevation angles show lower metallicities, consistent with the metallicity gradient in the disk derived from MaNGA maps. Higher elevation angle sight lines show higher ionization, lower H I-column density, super-solar metallicity, and velocities consistent with the direction of galactic outflow. Our data offer the first detailed comparisons of CGM properties (kinematics and metallicity) with extrapolations of detailed galaxy maps from integral field spectroscopy; similar studies for larger samples are needed to more fully understand how galaxies interact with their CGM.

  The proximity and duration of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li led to the discovery of narrow, blue-shifted absorption lines in X-rays and UV. The gas seen in X-ray absorption is consistent with bound material close to the apocenter of elliptical orbital paths, or with a disk wind similar to those seen in Seyfert-1 active galactic nuclei. We present a new analysis of the deepest high-resolution XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra of ASASSN-14li. Driven by the relative strengths of He-like and H-like charge states, the data require [N/C] &gt; 2.4, in qualitative agreement with UV spectral results. Flows of the kind seen in the X-ray spectrum of ASASSN-14li were not clearly predicted in simulations of TDEs; this left open the possibility that the observed absorption might be tied to gas released in prior AGN activity. However, the abundance pattern revealed in this analysis points to a single star rather than a standard AGN accretion flow comprised of myriad gas contributions. The simplest explanation of the data is likely that a moderately massive star (M ~ 3 Msun) with significant CNO processing was disrupted. An alternative explanation is that a lower mass star was disrupted that had previously been stripped of its envelope. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our analysis and these interpretations.   

Little Red Dots or Brown Dwarfs? NIRSpec Discovery of Three Brown Dwarfs

  Cold, substellar objects such as brown dwarfs have long been recognized as contaminants in color-selected samples of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In particular, their near- to mid-infrared colors (1--5 $\mu$m) can closely resemble the V-shaped ($f_{\lambda}$) spectra of highly-reddened accreting supermassive black holes, the little red dots, especially at $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$. Recently, a NIRCam-selected sample of little red dots over 45 arcmin$^2$ has been followed-up with deep NIRSpec multi-object prism spectroscopy through the UNCOVER program. By investigating the acquired spectra, we identify three out of the 13 followed-up objects as T dwarfs with temperatures between 650 and 1300 K and distances between 0.8 and 4.8 kpc. We identify the remaining 10 objects as extragalactic sources at $z_{\rm spec} &gt; 3$. Given that three of these sources are the strongly lensed images of the same AGN (Abell2744-QSO1), we derive a brown dwarf contamination fraction of 27\% in this NIRCam-selection of little red dots. We find that in the near-infrared filters, brown dwarfs appear much bluer than the highly-reddened AGN, providing an avenue for distinguishing the two and compiling cleaner samples of photometrically-selected highly-reddened AGN.
