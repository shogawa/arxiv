  The merger of supermassive black holes (BBH) produces mHz gravitational waves (GW), which are potentially detectable by future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Such binary systems are usually embedded in an accretion disk environment at the centre of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent studies suggest the plasma environment imposes measurable imprints on the GW signal if the mass ratio of the binary is around q $ \sim10^{-4}-10^{-3}$. The effect of the gaseous environment on the GW signal is strongly dependent on the disk's parameters, therefore it is believed that future low-frequency GW detections will provide us with precious information about the physics of AGN accretion disks. We investigate this effect by measuring the disk torques on the binary system by modelling several magnetized tori. Using GRMHD HARM-COOL code, we perform 2D simulations of weakly-magnetized thin accretion disks, with a possible truncation and transition to advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). In our numerical simulations, we study the angular momentum transport and turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We quantify the disk's effective alpha viscosity and its evolution over time. We apply our numerical results to estimate the relativistic viscous torque and GW phase shift due to the gas environment.

  Dust-obscured galaxies are thought to represent an early evolutionary phase of massive galaxies in which the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is still deeply buried in significant amounts of dusty material and its emission is strongly suppressed. The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope enables us for the first time to detect the rest-frame optical emission of heavily obscured AGN and unveil the properties of the hidden accreting super-massive black holes (BHs). In this work, we present the JWST/NIRSpec IFS data of ALESS073.1, a massive, dusty, star-forming galaxy at $z = 4.76$ hosting an AGN at its center. The detection of a very broad $H_\alpha$ emission associated with the Broad Line Region (BLR) confirms the presence of a BH ($\log(M_{BH}/M_\odot)&gt;8.7$) accreting at less than 15\% of its Eddington limit and classifies the target as a Type 1 AGN. The rest-frame optical emission lines also reveal a fast ionized gas outflow marginally resolved in the galaxy center. The high sensitivity of NIRSpec allows us to perform the kinematic analysis of the narrow H$\alpha$ component which indicates that the warm ionized gas velocity field is consistent with disk rotation. We also find that, in the innermost nuclear regions ($&lt; 1.5$ kpc), the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the disk reaches $\sim 150$ km/s, $\sim 2-3$ times higher than the velocity dispersion inferred from the [CII] 158$\mu$m line tracing mostly cold gas. Since, at large radii, the velocity dispersion of the warm and cold gas are comparable, we conclude that the outflows are injecting turbulence in the warm ionized gas in the central region, but they are not sufficiently powerful to disrupt the dense gas and quench star formation. These findings support the scenario that dust-obscured galaxies represent the evolutionary stage preceding the unobscured quasar when all gas and dust are removed from the host.

  JWST is revealing a new population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts $z\gtrsim5$. Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program UNCOVER of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact, with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: $60\%$ show definitive evidence for broad-line H$\alpha$ with FWHM$\, &gt;2000$ km/s, for $20\%$ current data are inconclusive, and $20\%$ are brown dwarf stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red $z&gt;5$ AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield $&gt;80\%$ AGN. Remarkably, among all $z_{\rm phot}&gt;5$ galaxies with F277W$-$F444W$&gt;1$ in UNCOVER at least $33\%$ are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least $80\%$ AGN for sources with F277W$-$F444W$&gt;1.6$. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of $10^7-10^9$ M$_{\odot}$. While their UV-luminosities ($-16&gt;M_{\rm UV}&gt;-20$ AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of $10^7-10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ black holes radiating at $\sim 10-40\%$ of Eddington. The number densities are surprisingly high at $\sim10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for $\sim1\%$ of the UV-selected galaxies. While their UV-faintness suggest they may not contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth.
