  Shocked POst-starburst Galaxies (SPOGs) exhibit both emission lines suggestive of shock-heated gas and post-starburst-like stellar absorption, resulting in a unique subset for galaxy evolution studies. We have observed 77 galaxies that fulfilled the SPOGs criteria selection using the DeVeny Spectrograph on the Lowell Discovery Telescope. Our long-slit minor axis spectra detect H$\alpha$ and [O III] in some SPOGs out to 6 kpc above the galactic plane. We find extraplanar ionized gas in 31 targets of our sample overall. Using their internal and external kinematics, we argue that 22 galaxies host outflows with ionized gas masses ranging from $10^2 M_{\odot}$ to $10^5 M_{\odot}$. The rest are likely extended diffuse ionized gas. A positive correlation exists between AGN luminosity and the extraplanar gas extent, velocity dispersion, and mass$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$suggesting that the AGN may indeed drive the outflows detected in AGN hosts. The low masses of the extraplanar gas suggest that these outflows are not depleting each galaxy's gas reserves. The outflows, therefore, are not likely a significant quenching mechanism in these SPOGs.

  This study investigates the influence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) on galactic morphology, focusing on their evolution within dwarf galaxies at high redshift (z~2). Using high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations, we explore how IMBH properties, including seed masses, formation times, and feedback mechanisms, shape the morphology and properties of central dwarf galaxies. The simulations analyze galaxies in both high- and low-spin dark matter halos, under varying conditions of AGN feedback and black hole seeding methods, to assess their effects on gas fractions, star formation, and structural characteristics.   Results indicate that AGN feedback, particularly wind strength, significantly impacts galactic properties. Strong feedback results in lower stellar masses, flatter morphologies, and intermediate rotational support, along with prominent central structures and low Sersic indices (n &lt; 2). These findings challenge the applicability of low-redshift diagnostics like Gini-M20 at high redshift. Synthetic JWST observations reveal that pixelation effects may overestimate galaxy sizes, highlighting the complexity of linking IMBH evolution with dwarf galaxy formation and morphology. This study provides new insights into the typical environments of IMBHs in dwarf galaxies and their role in shaping early galactic structures.

  The recent discovery of little red dots - a population of extremely compact and highly dust-reddened high redshift galaxies - by the James Webb Space Telescope presents a new challenge to the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. Their remarkably high luminosities at redshifts 5 &lt; z &lt; 10, appear to challenge LambdaCDM cosmology and galaxy formation models, as they imply stellar masses and star formation rates that exceed the upper limits set by these models. LRDs are currently subjects of debate as the mechanisms behind their high luminosities are not yet fully understood. LRD energy outputs are thought to be either dominated by star formation or their energy output results from the hosting of active galactic nuclei. We investigate the starburst hypothesis by attempting to replicate the stellar properties of LRDs using output data from the FLARES simulation suite. Comparative analysis of galactic properties such as galactic number density, stellar mass and star formation rate yield significant tension between simulated and observed galaxies. The FLARES simulation overestimates the number densities of galaxies with stellar masses similar to observed LRDs by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the simulation shows an overestimation of star formation rates. These tensions suggest a potential underestimation by the FLARES model of stellar feedback mechanisms such as active galactic nuclei feedback. These results suggest that the starburst hypothesis may be insufficient to explain the observed properties of these galaxies. Instead, the AGN scenario should be further investigated by repeating the methods in this study with a hydrodynamic galaxy simulation suite that models a higher influence of AGN feedback mechanisms on stellar activity in high redshift galaxies.

  The Compton-thick Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) arguably constitute the most elusive class of sources as they are absorbed by large column densities above logN_H(cm^-2)=24. These extreme absorptions hamper the detection of the central source even in hard X-ray energies. In this work, we use both SWIFT and NuSTAR observations in order to derive the most accurate yet Compton-thick AGN luminosity function. We, first, compile a sample of candidate Compton-thick AGN (logN_H(cm^-2)= 24-25) detected in the Swift BAT all-sky survey in the 14-195 keV band. We confirm that they are Compton-thick sources by using the follow-up NuSTAR observations already presented in the literature. Our sample is composed of 44 sources, consistent with a column density of logN_H(cm^-2)=24-25 at the 90% confidence level. These have intrinsic luminosities higher than L(10-50 keV) ~ 3x10^41 erg/s and are found up to a redshift of z=0.05 (200 Mpc). We derive the luminosity function of Compton-thick AGN using a Bayesian methodology where both the full column density and the luminosity distributions are taken into account. The faint end of the luminosity function is flat, having a slope of 0.01(+0.51,-0.74), rather arguing against a numerous population of low luminosity Compton-thick AGN. Based on our luminosity function, we estimate that the fraction of Compton-thick AGN relative to the total number of AGN is of the order of 24 (+5,-5) % in agreement with previous estimates in the local Universe based on BAT samples.

  We study the physical origins of outflowing cold clouds in a sample of 14 low-redshift dwarf ($M_{\ast} \lesssim 10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$) galaxies from the COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY) using Keck/ESI data. Outflows are traced by broad (FWHM ~ 260 $\rm{km}$ $\rm{s^{-1}}$) and very-broad (VB; FWHM ~ 1200 $\rm{km}$ $\rm{s^{-1}}$) velocity components in strong emission lines like [O III] $\lambda 5007$ and $\rm{H}\alpha$. The maximum velocities ($v_{\rm{max}}$) of broad components correlate positively with SFR, unlike the anti-correlation observed for VB components, and are consistent with superbubble models. In contrast, supernova-driven galactic wind models better reproduce the $v_{\rm{max}}$ of VB components. Direct radiative cooling from a hot wind significantly underestimates the luminosities of both broad and VB components. A multi-phase wind model with turbulent radiative mixing reduces this discrepancy to at least one dex for most VB components. Stellar photoionization likely provides additional energy since broad components lie in the starburst locus of excitation diagnostic diagrams. We propose a novel interpretation of outflow origins in star-forming dwarf galaxies$-$broad components trace expanding superbubble shells, while VB components originate from galactic winds. One-zone photoionization models fail to explain the low-ionization lines ([S II] and [O I]) of broad components near the maximal starburst regime, which two-zone photoionization models with density-bounded channels instead reproduce. These two-zone models indicate anisotropic leakage of Lyman continuum photons through low-density channels formed by expanding superbubbles. Our study highlights extreme outflows ($v_{\rm{max}} \gtrsim 1000$ $\rm{km}$ $\rm{s^{-1}}$) in 9 out of 14 star-forming dwarf galaxies, comparable to AGN-driven winds.

  Some galaxy clusters contain non-thermal synchrotron emitting plasma permeating the intracluster medium (ICM). The spectral properties of this radio emission are not well characterized at decameter wavelengths ({\nu} &lt; 30 MHz), primarily due to the severe corrupting effects of the ionosphere. Using a recently developed calibration strategy, we present LOFAR images below 30 MHz of the low mass galaxy cluster Abell 655, which was serendipitously detected in an observation of the bright calibrator 3C 196. We combine this observation with LOFAR data at 144 MHz, and new Band 4 Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations centered at 650 MHz. In the 15-30 MHz LOFAR image, diffuse emission is seen with a physical extent of about 700 kpc. We argue that the diffuse emission detected in this galaxy cluster likely has multiple origins. At higher frequencies (650 MHz), the diffuse emission resembles a radio halo, while at lower frequencies the emission seems to consist of several components and bar-like structures. It suggests that most low-frequency emission in this cluster comes from re-energized fossil plasma from old AGN outbursts, coexisting with the radio halo component. By counting the number of cluster radio detections in the decameter band, we estimate that around a quarter of the Planck clusters host re-energised fossil plasma that is detectable in the decameter band with LOFAR.
