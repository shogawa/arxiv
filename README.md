  The z=1.14 $\infty$ galaxy consists of two ringed nuclei with an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) in between them. The system is likely the result of a nearly face-on collision between two disk galaxies with massive bulges. In van Dokkum et al. (2025) we suggested that the SMBH may have formed from shocked and compressed gas at the collision site, in a runaway gravitational collapse. Here we test this hypothesis using newly obtained NIRSpec IFU observations. We first confirm that the system has a cloud of gas in between the nuclei that is photo-ionized by an AGN-like object near its center. Next, we constrain the origin of the SMBH from its radial velocity. If it formed in the cloud its velocity should be similar to the surrounding gas, whereas it would be offset if the SMBH had escaped from one of the nuclei or were associated with a faint galaxy. We find that the radial velocity of the SMBH is within $\sim 50$ km/s of that of the surrounding gas, as expected if the SMBH formed within the cloud. Unexpectedly, we find that both nuclei have active SMBHs as well, as inferred from very broad H$\alpha$ emission with FWHM $\sim 3000$ km/s. This rules out scenarios where the central SMBH was ejected from one of the nuclei in a gravitational recoil. Taken together, these results strengthen the hypothesis that the object at the center of the $\infty$ galaxy is a newly formed SMBH.

  We present a kinematical study of the ionized and molecular gas in the central region (~7-14"~100-200pc) of the nearby radio galaxy Cen A. We used JWST/MIRI MRS 5-28$\mu$m observations taken as part of the MIR Characterization of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) of the MIRI EC. The two gas phases present contrasting morphologies and kinematics. The brightest emission from the ionized gas, traced with a range of IP lines ([Fe II] to [Ne VI]), is extended along the direction of the radio jet. We also detected emission from low IP emission lines and H$_2$ transitions in the galaxy disk. Both gas phases present rotational motions but also complex kinematics. The observations reveal several ionized gas kinematical features that are consistent with simulation predictions of a jet-driven bubble and outflow interacting with the galaxy ISM. These include broad components in the nuclear line profiles ($\sigma$~600km/s), high velocities (~ +1000, -1400km/s) confined within the nuclear region, velocities of hundreds of km/s in several directions in the central 2", and enhanced velocity dispersions perpendicular to the radio jet. Moreover, we find evidence of shock excitation in the nuclear region based on MIR line ratios. We compared the ionized gas mass outflow rate with Cen A's AGN luminosity and radio jet power and demonstrate that both mechanisms provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow. The noncircular motions observed in the H$_2$ lines can be reproduced with either a warped rotating disk model or a radial component. The latter might be to related to gas streamers detected in cold molecular gas. There is no clear indication of a fast nuclear H$_2$ outflow, only a weak blueshifted component. This could be due to a relatively low nuclear warm H$_2$ column density and/or the limited geometrical coupling of Cen A's inner radio jet with the circumnuclear disk of the galaxy. (Abridged)

  We present a spatially resolved Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich analysis of the narrow-line region (NLR) in the low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) I galaxy NGC 5005 using Hubble Space Telescope narrowband imaging of [O III]${\lambda}$5007, H${\beta}$, H${\alpha}$, and [S II]${\lambda}{\lambda}$6717,6731. With a resolution of ${\lesssim}$0.1 (${\lesssim}$10 pc at z = 0.003), we dissect the NLR into H II (star-forming), Seyfert, and LINERs across spatial scales extending up to r$\sim$8 kpc from the nucleus. Our results reveal a compact nuclear region exhibiting Seyfert-like emission, consistent with photoionization by a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Surrounding this Seyfert-like nucleus is a thin ($\sim$20 pc thick) higher-excitation LINER-like cocoon, likely arising from shock-excited gas in the interstellar medium (ISM). Beyond this cocoon, a centrally localized extended (r$\sim$1 kpc) LINER-like region surrounds the Seyfert-like nucleus and cocoon, likely ionized by the AGN, while a more extended (r${\gtrsim}$2 kpc) LINER-like zone may be ionized by a combination of post-AGB stars and shocks from gas inflows. We also detect H II-like regions at both small and large scales. In the inner 500 pc, these regions may be triggered by jet-ISM interactions, potentially inducing localized star formation. At r$\sim$4 kpc, we identify an outer H II-like region tracing a large-scale star-forming ring, where ionization is dominated by young stars.

  The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is produced by the emission of unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN), thus providing key information about the properties of the primary and reprocessed X-ray emission components of the AGN population. Equally important, studies of individual sources provide additional constraints on the properties of AGN, such as their luminosity and obscuration. Until now, these constraints have not been self-consistently addressed by intrinsically linking emission, absorption, and reflection. Here we perform numerical simulations with the ray-tracing code, RefleX, which allows us to self-consistently model the X-ray emission of AGN with flexible geometries for the circumnuclear medium. Using the RefleX-simulated emission of an AGN population, we attempt to simultaneously reproduce the CXB and absorption properties measured in the X-rays, namely the observed fraction of $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ in bins of log($N_{\mathrm{H}}$) and the fraction of absorbed AGN, including their redshift and luminosity evolution. We sample an intrinsic X-ray luminosity function and construct gradually more complex physically motivated geometrical models. We examine how well each model can match all observational constraints using a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach. We find that, while the simple unification model can reproduce the CXB, a luminosity dependent dusty torus is needed to reproduce the absorption properties. When adding an accretion disc, the model best matches all constraints simultaneously. Our synthetic population is able to reproduce the dependence of the covering factor on luminosity, the AGN number counts from several surveys, and the observed correlation between reflection and obscuration. Finally, we derive an intrinsic Compton-thick fraction of 21$\pm$7%, consistent with local observations.

  We present a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 5.077, observed with both NIRSpec/MSA and NIRSpec/IFU by the JADES and BlackTHUNDER surveys. The target exhibits all the hallmark features of a 'Little Red Dot' (LRD) AGN. The combination of spatially resolved and high-resolution spectroscopy offers deeper insight into its nature. The H$\alpha$ line has multiple components, including two broad Gaussians, yielding a black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) = 7.65$, while the narrow [O III]$\lambda$5007 gives a galaxy dynamical mass of $\log(M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot) = 9.1$, suggesting a dynamically overmassive black hole relative to the host galaxy. The target has two satellites, and is immersed in a 7-kpc wide pool of ionized gas. A spatially detached outflow is also tentatively detected. H$\alpha$ shows strong absorption with high equivalent width (EW), ruling out a stellar origin, and with velocity and velocity dispersion of v = -13 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma$ = 120 km s$^{-1}$. There is tentative evidence (2.6 $\sigma$) of temporal variability in the EW of the H$\alpha$ absorber over two rest-frame months. If confirmed, this would suggest a highly dynamic environment. Notably, while the H$\alpha$ absorber is clearly visible and even dominant in the high-resolution G395H observations, it is not detected in the medium-resolution G395M data of the same epoch. This implies that the current incidence rate of absorbers in LRDs - and especially of rest-frame absorbers - may be severely underestimated, because most LRDs rely on lower-resolution spectroscopy. In this context, the high incidence rate of rest-frame absorbers in LRDs may indicate a configuration that is either intrinsically stationary, such as a rotating disc, or that exhibits time-averaged stability, such as an oscillatory 'breathing mode' accretion of cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas around the SMBH.
