  The continuum reverberation mapping is widely used in studying accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGN). While some indirect evidence and simulations indicated that the diffuse continuum, especially the strong Balmer continuum from the broad line region (BLR), may contribute to the continuum in the u/U band. Here, we present direct evidence for this contribution. In this work, we apply the ICCF-Cut method to continuum reverberation mapping to extract the possible diffuse continuum light curves of 6 AGNs with high cadence, high quality and multi-band observations. We find the existence of an outer component out of the accretion disk for each of 6 AGNs in the Swift U band. Meanwhile, similar results can be derived by JAVELIN Photometric Reverberation Mapping Model for 4 of them. The lags of the outer components are consistent with the predicted Balmer continuum lags, which are about half of the H$\beta$ lag values. Our result directly reinforces that an outer component, especially the Balmer continuum in the rest-frame u/U band, can contribute significantly to the continuum reverberation lags of AGNs.

  Arp 220 is the nearest ULIRG; it shows evidence of 100 pc-scale molecular outflows likely connected with galaxy-scale outflows traced by ionised and neutral gas. The two highly obscured nuclei of Arp 220 are the site of intense star formation, with extreme star-formation rate surface densities (~ 10^3 Msun/yr/kpc2). Despite extensive investigations searching for AGN activity in the Arp 220 nuclei, direct evidence remains elusive. We present JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations covering the 0.9 - 5.1 um wavelength range of the innermost (5''x4'', i.e. 1.8x1.5 kpc) regions of Arp 220. The primary goal is to investigate the potential presence of AGN signatures in the nuclear regions by analysing the spectra extracted from circular apertures of radius 55 pc (0.15'') around each of the two nuclei. We identify ~ 70 ionised and ~ 50 molecular emission lines in the nuclear spectra of Arp 220; we use recombination line ratios to measure optical extinctions in the range AV ~ 11 - 14 mag. High ionisation lines are not detected, except the [Mg IV] line at 4.49 um which we interpret as due to shocks rather than to AGN ionisation. We identify broadening and multiple kinematic components in the HI and H2 lines caused by outflows and shocks, with velocities up to ~ 550 km/s. Significantly higher velocities (up to ~ 900 km/s) are detected in the off-nuclear regions; however, they do not conclusively represent evidence for AGN activity. Even with the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec IFS, achieving an unambiguous identification or exclusion of the presence of an AGN in the Arp 220 system remains challenging, because of its extreme dust obscuration.
