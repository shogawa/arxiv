  Recent observations of high-energy neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN), NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, suggest that cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole and high-energy protons and electrons can cool efficiently via interactions with ambient photons and gas. The dark matter density may be significantly enhanced near the central black hole, and CRs could lose energies predominantly due to scatterings with the ambient dark matter particles. We propose CR cooling in AGN as a new probe of dark matter-proton and dark matter-electron scatterings. Under plausible astrophysical assumptions, our constraints on sub-GeV dark matter can be the strongest derived to date. Some of the parameter space favored by thermal light dark matter models might already be probed with current multimessenger observations of AGN.

  We present high-resolution VLT/UVES spectroscopy and a detailed analysis of the unique Broad Absorption-Line system towards the quasar SDSS J165252.67+265001.96. This system exhibits low-ionization metal absorption lines from the ground states and excited energy levels of Fe II and Mn II, and the meta-stable 2^3S excited state of He I. The extended kinematics of the absorber encompasses three main clumps with velocity offsets of -5680, -4550, and -1770 km s$^{-1}$ from the quasar emission redshift, $z=0.3509\pm0.0003$, derived from [O II] emission. Each clump shows moderate partial covering of the background continuum source, $C_f \approx [0.53; 0.24; 0.81]$. We discuss the excitation mechanisms at play in the gas, which we use to constrain the distance of the clouds from the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) as well as the density, temperature, and typical sizes of the clouds. The number density is found to be $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^4\rm cm^{-3}$ and the temperature $T_e \sim 10^4\rm\,K$, with longitudinal cloudlet sizes of $\gtrsim0.01$ pc. Cloudy photo-ionization modelling of He I$^{*}$, which is also produced at the interface between the neutral and ionized phases, assuming the number densities derived from Fe II, constrains the ionization parameter to be $\log U \sim -3$. This corresponds to distances of a few 100 pc from the AGN. We discuss these results in the more general context of associated absorption-line systems and propose a connection between FeLoBALs and the recently-identified molecular-rich intrinsic absorbers. Studies of significant samples of FeLoBALs, even though rare per se, will soon be possible thanks to large dedicated surveys paired with high-resolution spectroscopic follow-ups.

  In the manuscript, a candidate of sub-pc binary black hole (BBH) system is reported in SDSS J1257+2023 through different properties of broad Balmer emission lines. After subtractions of host galaxy contributions, Gaussian functions are applied to measure emission lines in SDSS J1257+2023, leading line width (second moment) 760${\rm km/s}$ of broad H$\beta$ to be 0.69 times of line width 1100${\rm km/s}$ of broad H$\alpha$, quite different from normal line width ratio 1.1 of broad H$\beta$ to broad H$\alpha$ in quasars. The quite broader component in broad H$\alpha$ in SDSS J1257+2023 can be confirmed with confidence level higher than $5\sigma$ through F-test technique, through different model functions applied to measure emission lines. The broad Balmer emission lines having different line widths can be naturally explained by a BBH system with different obscurations on central two independent BLRs. Meanwhile, through ZTF light curves and corresponding phase folded light curves well described by sinusoidal function, BBH system expected optical QPOs can be detected with periodicity about 1000days, confirmed with confidence level higher than $3\sigma$ by Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram. And through CAR process simulated light curves, confidence level higher than $2\sigma$ can be determined to support the optical QPOs in SDSS J1257+2023 not from intrinsic AGN activities, although the ZTF light curves have short time durations. Moreover, through oversimplified BBH system simulated results, studying different broad Balmer lines as signs of BBH systems in normal quasars with flux ratios around 4 of broad H$\alpha$ to broad H$\beta$ could be done in near future.

  We investigate the formation and evolution of z=0 massive compact galaxies (MCGs) in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. We found that, as in observations, MCGs are mainly old (median age $\sim 10.8$ Gyr), have super-solar metallicities (median $\log Z/Z_{\odot}\sim0.35$) and are $\alpha$-enhanced (median $[\alpha/Fe]\sim0.25$). The age distribution extends to younger ages, however, and a few MCGs are as young as $\sim7$ Gyr. In general, MCGs assemble their mass early and accrete low angular momentum gas, significantly increasing their mass while growing their size much slower. A small fraction of MCGs follow another evolutionary path, going through a compaction event, with their sizes shrinking by 40% or more. The accretion of low angular momentum gas leads to enhanced SMBH growth, and MCGs reach the threshold SMBH mass of $\log M_\mathrm{BH}\sim10^{8.5} M_\odot$ - when kinetic AGN feedback kicks in and quenches the galaxy - earlier than non-compact galaxies. Comparing MCGs to a sample of median-sized quiescent galaxies matched in effective velocity dispersion, we find that their accretion histories are very different. 71% of MCGs do not merge after quenching compared to 37% of median-sized quiescent galaxies. Moreover, tracing these populations back in time, we find that at least a third of median-sized quiescent galaxies do not have a compact progenitor, underscoring that both dry mergers and progenitor bias effects are responsible for the differences in the kinematics and stellar population properties of MCGs and median-sized quiescent galaxies.

  Rebirth of X-ray polarimetric instruments will have a significant impact on our knowledge of compact accreting sources. The properties of inner-accreting regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or X-ray binary systems (XRBs), such as black-hole spin, their disc inclination and orientation, shape and size of their corona, can be polarimetrically studied, parallelly to the well-known X-ray spectroscopic and timing techniques. In this work, we provide a new spectropolarimetric numerical estimate of X-rays in the lamp-post coronal model for a distant observer, including a polarized reflected radiation from the accretion disc. The local disc reflection was simulated using the codes TITAN and STOKES and includes variable disc ionization as well as Monte Carlo treatment of Compton multiple scatterings. We introduce a relativistic code KYNSTOKES based on our well-tested KY package that accounts for all relativistic effects on radiation near a black hole, apart from the returning radiation, and adds a possibility of polarized coronal emission. We study the spectrum, polarization degree and polarization angle at spatial infinity for various global system parameters and we demonstrate the difference at infinity, if analytical local reflection computations are used. We newly predict that in the hard X-rays the reflected component can be 25% polarized and the total emission can be 9% polarized in the most favourable, yet realistic configurations of radio-quiet AGNs. Thus, the relativistic disc reflection remains important for the interpretation of X-ray polarimetric observations.   

The brightest (and faintest) sources in the radio sky

  Radio observations allow us to identify a wide range of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are galaxies that have gas accreting onto the supermassive black-hole at the centre. By observing these sources at multiple radio frequencies, a more-complete picture can be built of black-hole accretion activity. This completeness is aided by radio waves being unaffected by dust along the line-of-sight to these sources, which cannot be said for waves in the optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum. (Hence, dust obscuration leads to biases in AGN samples selected using optical observations.) A thorough compilation of ~2,000 of the brightest radio-sources in the southern sky [and so of particular relevance for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its precursor/pathfinder telescopes] is the GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample, selected at 151 MHz, with subsets being followed up with MeerKAT and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Meanwhile, optical spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is being used to derive crucial redshift information, both for G4Jy sources and for radio-faint AGN in the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey. The origin of the radio emission in these faint sources is a subject of great debate within the AGN/radio-astronomy communities.

  We present an analysis of a sample of robust high redshift galaxies selected photometrically from the `blank' fields of the Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization Science (PEARLS) survey and Early Release Observations (ERO) data of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the aim of selecting candidate high redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN). Sources were identified from the parent sample using a threefold selection procedure, which includes spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to identify sources that are best fitted by AGN SED templates, a further selection based on the relative performance of AGN and non-AGN models, and finally morphological fitting to identify compact sources of emission, resulting in a purity-oriented procedure. Using this procedure, we identify a sample of nine AGN candidates at $6.5 &lt; z &lt; 12$, from which we constrain their physical properties as well as measure a lower bound on the AGN fraction in this redshift range of $5 \pm 1$\%. As this is an extreme lower limit due to our focus on purity and our SEDs being calibrated for unobscured Type 1 AGN, this demonstrates that AGN are perhaps quite common at this early epoch. The rest-frame UV colors of our candidate objects suggest that these systems are potentially candidate obese black hole galaxies (OBG), or AGN with very little galaxy component. We also investigate emission from our sample sources from fields overlapping with Chandra and VLA surveys, allowing us to place X-ray and 3 GHz radio detection limits on our candidates. Of note is a $z = 11.9$ candidate source exhibiting an abrupt morphological shift in the reddest band as compared to the bluer bands, indicating a potential merger or an unusually strong outflow.
