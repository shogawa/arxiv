  Gas metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure can affect the observed ratios of specific strong emission lines within galaxies. While the theoretical strong lines diagnostics for gas metallicity, ionization parameters, and gas pressure in star-forming regions are well-established, theoretical diagnostics for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) narrow line regions are still lacking. In Zhu et al. (2023), we presented a new AGN model that provides the best predictions for observations spanning the UV, optical, and infrared wavelengths. This paper presents a suite of theoretical diagnostics for the gas metallicity, ionization parameter, gas pressure, and the peak energy in AGN ionizing radiation field $E_{peak}$ for AGN narrow-line regions spanning the UV and optical wavelengths. We investigate the model dependency on the ionization parameter, gas pressure, $E_{peak}$, and the nitrogen scaling relation and make recommendations on metallicity diagnostics that are most robust against these parameters. We test our new AGN metallicity diagnostics using optical galaxy spectra from Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16. These tests show that the metallicities measured from different diagnostics in this paper are consistent within $\sim0.3$ dex. We compare consistent HII and AGN diagnostics and demonstrate that HII and AGN diagnostics should not be used interchangeably. With a wide wavelength coverage, we anticipate that these AGN diagnostics will enable new metallicity studies of galaxies dominated by AGN.

  Building the radio sky template are crucial for detecting the 21 cm emission line signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), as well as for other cosmological research endeavors. Utilizing data from the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 150 MHz, we recalibrated the luminosity function for various types of radio sources, including High Excitation Radio Galaxies (HERGs), Low Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs), Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (RQ-AGNs), and Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGs). We subsequently updated the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) code to generate refined mock radio source catalogues. The simulated source counts from this work align more closely with observed data at redshifts greater than $z&gt;4$. Additionally, the differential source counts in total intensity within the flux density range of $0.1-1~\mathrm{mJy}$ closely mirror actual observations. Due to our model incorporating a lower number of faint sources compared to T-RECS, it predicts a reduced power spectrum for point sources, suggesting a potential advantage in studies in low frequency band.

  This paper presents a 610 MHz radio survey covering 1.94 square degrees around the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP), which includes parts of the AKARI (ADF-N) and Euclid, Deep Fields North. The median 5-sigma sensitivity is 28 microJy beam per beam, reaching as low as 19 microJy per beam, with a synthesised beam of 3.6 x 4.1 arcsec. The catalogue contains 1675 radio components, with 339 grouped into multi-component sources and 284 isolated components likely part of double radio sources. Imaging, cataloguing, and source identification are presented, along with preliminary scientific results. From a non-statistical sub-set of 169 objects with multi-wavelength AKARI and other detections, luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) represent 66 percent of the sample, ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) 4 percent, and sources with L_IR &lt; 1011 L_sun 30 percent. In total, 56 percent of sources show some AGN presence, though only seven are AGN-dominated. ULIRGs require three times higher AGN contribution to produce high-quality SED fits compared to lower luminosity galaxies, and AGN presence increases with AGN fraction. The PAH mass fraction is insignificant, although ULIRGs have about half the PAH strength of lower IR-luminosity galaxies. Higher luminosity galaxies show gas and stellar masses an order of magnitude larger, suggesting higher star formation rates. For LIRGs, AGN presence increases with redshift, indicating that part of the total luminosity could be contributed by AGN activity rather than star formation. Simple cross-matching revealed 13 ROSAT QSOs, 45 X-ray sources, and 61 sub-mm galaxies coincident with GMRT radio sources.

  The radiative cooling time of hot gas in the cool cores of many galaxy clusters and massive elliptical galaxies drops in the centre to below 100 million years. The mass cooling rates inferred from simple modelling of X-ray observations of these objects are very low, indicating that either AGN feedback is tightly balanced or that soft X-rays from cooling gas are somehow hidden from view. An intrinsic absorption model developed for application to galaxy clusters is used here to search for hidden cooling flows (HCFs) in seven nearby elliptical galaxies. Mass cooling rates of 0.5-8 solar masses per year are found in each galaxy. The absorbed cooling flow luminosity is in agreement with the observed Far Infrared (FIR) luminosity in each case, indicating absorbed emission is energetically capable of emerging in the FIR band. An observed lack of agreement between HCF rates and normal star formation rates suggests the cooled material must have an alternative fate, with low-mass star formation considered as the primary outcome.   

Little Red Dots at an Inflection Point: Ubiquitous "V-Shaped" Turnover

  Among the most puzzling early discoveries of JWST are "Little Red Dots" -- compact red sources that host broad Balmer emission lines and, in many cases, exhibit a "V shaped" change in slope in the rest-optical. The physical properties of Little Red Dots currently have order-of-magnitude uncertainties, because models to explain the continuum of these sources differ immensely. Here, we leverage the complete selection of red sources in the RUBIES program, supplemented with public PRISM spectra, to study the origin of this "V shape". By fitting a broken power law with a flexible inflection point, we find that a large fraction (20/44, nearly all spatially unresolved) of extremely red H$\alpha$ emitters at $2&lt;z&lt;6$ exhibit a strong change in slope, and that all strong inflections appear associated with the Balmer limit ($0.3645$ $\mu$m). Using a simple model of a reddened AGN with an unobscured scattered light component, we demonstrate that the observed "V shape" in Little Red Dots is unlikely to occur at any specific wavelength if the entire continuum is dominated by light from a power law AGN continuum. In contrast, models with an intrinsic feature at the Balmer limit, such as those that are dominated by evolved stellar populations in the rest-UV-to-optical, can produce the observed spectral shapes, provided that a reddened component picks up sufficiently redward of the break. While no model can comfortably explain the full Little Red Dot spectral energy distribution, the common inflection location suggests that it is most likely a single component that consistently dominates the rest-UV-to-optical in Little Red Dots, and that this component is associated with $T\sim10^4$ K hydrogen due to the clear preference for a break at H$_\infty$.
