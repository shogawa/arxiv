  We assemble a broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from optical to mid-infrared of nearby active galactic nuclei at $z &lt; 0.4$. SED fitting analysis is performed using semi-empirical templates derived from Palomar-Green quasars to classify the sample into normal, warm-dust-deficient (WDD), and hot-dust-deficient (HDD) AGNs. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests reveal that HDD AGNs exhibit, on average higher AGN luminosity than normal and WDD AGNs. HDD fraction, on the other hand, is only weakly correlated with black hole mass and inversely correlated with Eddington ratio. By fixing the other parameters, we conclude that the HDD fraction is primarily connected with the AGN luminosity. It implies that there is a causal connection between the covering factor of the hot dust component and AGN luminosity, possibly due to the sublimation of the innermost dust or the thickening of the intervening gas in the broad-line region. Analysis of the outflow properties traced by the wing of [O III]$\lambda5007$ suggests that outflows may be related to the formation and maintenance of the hot dust component. Finally, we demonstrate through comparison with previous studies that the classification of HDD AGNs requires careful subtraction of the host galaxy light.

  In this study, a refined approach for multicomponent fitting of active galactic nuclei (AGN) spectra is presented utilizing the newly developed Python code $fantasy$ (fully automated python tool for AGN spectra analysis). AGN spectra are modeled by simultaneously considering the underlying broken power-law continuum, predefined emission line lists, and an Fe II model, which is here extended to cover the wavelength range 3700 - 11000 A. The Fe II model, founded solely on atomic data, effectively describes the extensive emission of the complex iron ion in the vicinity of the H$\gamma$ and H$\beta$ lines, as well as near the H$\alpha$ line, which was previously rarely studied. The proposed spectral fitting approach is tested on a sample of high-quality AGN spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 17. The results indicate that when Fe II emission is present near H$\beta$, it is also detected redward from H$\alpha$, potentially contaminating the broad H$\alpha$ line wings and thus affecting the measurements of its flux and width. The production of Fe II emission is found to be strongly correlated with Eddington luminosity and appears to be controlled by the similar mechanism as the hydrogen Balmer lines. The study highlights the benefits of fitting AGN type 1 spectra with the $fantasy$ code, pointing that it may be used as a robust tool for analyzing a large number of AGN spectra in the coming spectral surveys.

  We explore the relationship between the ionized gas outflows and radio activity using a sample of $\sim$ 6000 AGNs at z &lt; 0.4 with the kinematical measurement based on the [O III] line profile and the radio detection in the VLA FIRST Survey. To quantify radio activity, we divide our sample into a series of binary subclasses based on the radio properties, i.e., radio-luminous/radio-weak, AGN-dominated/star-formation-contaminated, compact/extended, and radio-loud/radio-quiet. None of the binary subclasses exhibits a significant difference in the normalized [O III] velocity dispersion at a given [O III] luminosity once we correct for the influence of the host galaxy gravitational potential. We only detect a significant difference of [O III] kinematics between high and low radio-Eddington ratio (L$_{1.4 GHz}$/L$_{Edd}$) AGNs. In contrast, we find a remarkable difference in ionized gas kinematics between high and low bolometric-Eddington ratio AGNs. These results suggest that accretion rate is the primary mechanism in driving ionized gas outflows, while radio activity may play a secondary role providing additional influence on gas kinematics

  Coronal-Line Forest Active Galactic Nuclei (CLiF AGN) are characterized by strong, high-ionization lines, which are in contrast to what is found in typical AGNs. Here, we carry out an infrared analysis aimed at understanding the spectral energy distribution of six sources from this group. In this work, the properties of the dusty torus for these objects are analyzed. To this purpose, we infer the physical and geometrical properties of the dust structure that surrounds the central region by fitting with models the spectral energy distribution (SED) of CLiF AGNs in the infrared. For this analysis, we compare the results of three models: CLUMPY, SKIRTOR and CAT3D-WIND. Using the Bayesian information criterion, SKIRTOR was found to have the most robust fit to the SEDs in five out of six galaxies. The remaining object was best fitted with CLUMPY. The results indicate that these objects are preferentially Type~I sources, supporting the detection of broad components in the permitted lines, likely associated with the BLR in the near-infrared (NIR) spectra. The best SED fitting indicates that the line of sight gives access to the view of the central source for these objects, but the amount of dusty clouds in the same direction is high, suggesting the hypothesis that they obscure the emission of the continuum produced by the central source and that the obscuration makes the coronal lines to not overlap with the continuum.
