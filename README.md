We here report a spectroscopic identification of two new changing-look AGNs (CL-AGNs): SDSS\,J104705.16+544405.8 and SDSS\,J120447.91+170256.8 both with a "turn-off" type transition from type 1 to type 1.8/1.9. The identification is arrived by a follow-up spectroscopic observation of the five changing-look AGN (CL-AGN) candidates that are extracted from the sample recently released in Macleod et al. The candidates are extract by the authors from the Sloan Digit Sky Survey Data Release 7 spectroscopically confirmed quasars with large amplitude variability. By compiling a sample of 26 previously identified CL-AGNs, we confirm the claim in Macleod et al. that CL-AGNs tend to be biased against low Eddington ratio, and identify an overlap between the CL-AGNs at their dim state and the so-called intermediate-type AGNs. The overlap implies that there two populations of the intermediate-type AGNs with different origins. One is due to the torus orientation effect, and the another the intrinsic change of the accretion rate of the central supermassive blackholes.

The effective size of Broad Line Region (BLR), so-called the BLR radius, in galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGN) scales with the source luminosity. Therefore by determining this location either observationally through reverberation mapping or theoretically, one can use AGNs as an interesting laboratory to test cosmological models. In this article we focus on the theoretical side of BLR based on the Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow (FRADO) model. By simulating the dynamics of matter in BLR through a realistic model of radiation of accretion disk (AD) including the shielding effect, as well as incorporating the proper values of dust opacities, we investigate how the radial extension and geometrical height of the BLR depends on the Eddington ratio [and blackhole mass], and modeling of shielding effect. We show that assuming a range of Eddington ratios and shielding we are able to explain the measured time-delays in a sample of reverberation-measured AGNs.

We present hydrodynamic simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) within the circumnuclear disk (CND) of a typical AGN-dominated galaxy influenced by mechanical feedback from an active galactic nucleus(AGN). The simulations are coupled with the CHIMES non-equilibrium chemistry network to treat the radiative-cooling and AGN-heating. A focus is placed on the central 100 pc scale where AGN outflows are coupled to the ISM and constrained by observational Seyfert-2 galaxies. AGN-feedback models are implemented with different wind-velocity and mass-loading factors. We post-process the simulation snapshots with a radiative-transfer code to obtain the molecular emission lines. We find that the inclusion of an AGN promotes the formation of CO in clumpy and dense regions surrounding supermassive-blackholes (SMBH). The CO(1-0) intensity maps ($&lt;$6 Myr) in the CND seem to match well with observations of NGC 1068 with a best match for a model with 5000 $\rm km/s$ wind-velocity and a high mass-loading factor. We attempt to discern between competing explanations for the apparent counter-rotating gas disk in the NGC 1068 through an analysis of kinematic maps of the CO line emission. We suggest that mechanical AGN-feedback could explain the alignment-stability of position-angle across the different CND radii around the SMBH through momentum and energy loading of the wind. It is the wind-velocity that drives the disk out of alignment on a 100 pc scale for a long period of time. The position-velocity diagrams are in broad agreement with the predicted Keplerian rotation-curve in the model without-AGN, but the AGN models exhibit a larger degree of scatter, in better agreement with NGC 1068 observations.

An accreting supermassive blackhole, the central engine of active galactic nucleus (AGN), is capable of exciting extreme amplitude Alfven waves whose wavelength (wave packet) size is characterized by its clumpiness. The pondermotive force and wakefield are driven by these Alfven waves propagating in the AGN (blazar) jet and accelerate protons/nuclei to extreme energies beyond Zetta-electron volt (ZeV$=10^{21}$ eV). Such acceleration is prompt, localized, and does not suffer from the multiple scattering/bending enveloped in the Fermi acceleration that causes excessive synchrotron radiation loss beyond $10^{19}$ eV. The production rate of ZeV cosmic rays is found to be consistent with the observed gamma-ray luminosity function of blazars and their time variabilities.  

Close supermassive binary black holes

  It has been proposed that when the peaks of the broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are significantly blueshifted or redshifted from the systemic velocity of the host galaxy, this could be a consequence of orbital motion of a supermassive blackhole binary (SMB) (Gaskell 1983). The AGN J1536+0441 (=SDSS J153636.22+044127.0) has recently been proposed as an example of this phenomenon (Boroson &amp; Lauer 2009). It is proposed here instead that 1536+044 is an example of line emission from a disc. If this is correct, the lack of clear optical spectral evidence for close SMBs is significant and argues either that the merging of close SMBs is much faster than has generally been hitherto thought, or if the approach is slow, that when the separation of the binary is comparable to the size of the torus and broad-line region, the feeding of the black holes is disrupted.  

Primordial blackholes from Gauss-Bonnet-corrected single field inflation

Primordial blackholes formed in the early Universe via gravitational collapse of over-dense regions may contribute a significant amount to the present dark matter relic density. Inflation provides a natural framework for the production mechanism of primordial blackholes. For example, single field inflation models with a fine-tuned scalar potential may exhibit a period of ultra-slow roll, during which the curvature perturbation may be enhanced to become seeds of the primordial blackholes formed as the corresponding scales reenter the horizon. In this work, we propose an alternative mechanism for the primordial blackhole formation. We consider a model in which a scalar field is coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term and show that primordial blackholes may be seeded when a scalar potential term and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling term are nearly balanced. Large curvature perturbation in this model not only leads to the production of primordial blackholes but it also sources gravitational waves at the second order. We calculate the present density parameter of the gravitational waves and discuss the detectability of the signals by comparing them with sensitivity bounds of future gravitational wave experiments.

We use zoom-in techniques to re-simulate three high-redshift (z &gt; 5.5) halos which host 10^9 solar mass blackholes from the ~ Gpc volume, MassiveBlack cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. We examine a number of factors potentially affecting supermassive blackhole growth at high redshift in cosmological simulations. These include numerical resolution, feedback prescriptions and formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find that varying the size of the region over which feedback energy is deposited directly, either for fixed number of neighbours or fixed volume makes very little difference to the accretion history of blackholes. Changing mass resolution by factors of up to 64 also does not change the blackhole growth history significantly. We find that switching from the density-entropy formulation to the pressure-entropy formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics slightly increases the accretion rate onto blackholes. In general numerical details appear to have small effects on the main fueling mechanism for blackholes at these high redshifts. We examine the fashion by which this occurs, finding that the insensitivity to simulation technique seems to be a hallmark of the cold flow feeding picture of these high-z supermassive blackholes. We show that the gas that participates in critical accretion phases, in these massive objects at z &gt; 6~7 is in all cases colder, denser, and forms more coherent streams than the average gas in the halo. This is also mostly the case when the blackhole accretion is feedback regulated (z &lt; 6), however the distinction is less prominent. For our resimulated halos, cold flows appear to be a viable mechanism for forming the most massive blackholes in the early universe, occurring naturally in LambdaCDM models of structure formation. Not requiring fine tuning of numerical parameters, they seem to be physically inevitable in these objects.

Jet origination is one of the most important questions of AGN, yet it stays obscure. In this work, we made use of information of emission lines, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), \textit{Fermi}-LAT $γ$-ray emission, construct a blazar sample that contains 667 sources. We notice that jet power originations are different for BL Lacs and for FSRQs. The correlation between jet power $P_{\rm jet}$ and the normalized disk luminosity $L_{\rm Disk}/L_{\rm Edd}$ shows a slope of -1.77 for BL Lacs and a slope of 1.16 for FSRQs. The results seem to suggest that BL Lac jets are powered by extracting blackhole rotation energy, while FSRQ jets are mostly powered by accretion disks. Meanwhile, we find the accretion ratio $\dot{M} / \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ increase with the normalized $γ$-ray luminosity. Base on this, we propose a dividing line, ${\rm log} (L_{\rm BLR}/L_{\rm Edd}) = 0.25 \ {\rm log} (L_{\rm γ}/L_{\rm Edd}) - 2.23$, to separate FSRQs and BL Lacs in the diagram of $L_{\rm BLR}/L_{\rm Edd}$ against $L_{\rm γ}/L_{\rm Edd}$ through using the machine learning method, the method gives an accuracy of 84.5\%.   In addition, we propose an empirical formula, $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm \odot} \simeq L_{\rm γ}^{0.65}/21.46$, to estimate blackhole mass based on a strong correlation between $γ$-ray luminosity and blackhole mass. Strong $γ$-ray emission is typical in blazars, and the emission is always boosted by a Doppler beaming effect. In this work, we generate a new method to estimate a lower-limit of Doppler factor $δ$ and give $δ_{\rm BL Lac} = 7.94$ and $δ_{\rm FSRQ} = 11.55$.

A multitude of JWST studies reveal a surprising over-abundance of over-massive accreting super-massive blackholes (SMBHs) -- leading to a deepening tension between theory and observation in the first billion years of cosmic time. Across X-ray to infrared wavelengths, models built off of pre-JWST predictions fail to easily reproduce observed AGN signatures (or lack thereof), driving uncertainty around the true nature of these sources. Using a sample of JWST AGN identified via their broadened Halpha emission and covered by the deepest X-ray surveys, we find neither any measurable X-ray emission nor any detection of high-ionization emission lines frequently associated with accreting SMBHs. We propose that these sources are accreting at or beyond the Eddington limit, which reduces the need for efficient production of heavy SMBH seeds at cosmic dawn. Using a theoretical model of super-Eddington accretion, we can produce the observed relative dearth of both X-ray and ultraviolet emission, as well as the high Balmer decrements, without the need for significant dust attenuation. This work indicates that super-Eddington accretion is easily achieved through-out the early Universe, and further study is required to determine what environments are required to trigger this mode of black hole growth.

In Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow (FRADO) model which provides the source of material above the accretion disk (AD) as an option to explain the formation mechanism of Broad Line Region (BLR) in AGNs, the BLR inner radius ($\rm{BLR}_{in}$ hereafter) is set by the condition that the dust evaporates immediately upon departure from the AD surface. On the other hand, the location of BLR clouds obtained observationaly via reverberation mapping shows some scaling with the source luminosity, so-called RL relation. We assume $\rm{BLR}_{in}$ to be the location of BLR clouds, then using a realistic expression for the radiation pressure of an AD, and having included the proper values of dust opacity, and shielding effect as well, we report our numerical results on calculation of $\rm{BLR}_{in}$ based on FRADO model. We investigate how it scales with monochromatic luminosity at 5100 angstrom for a grid of blackhole masses and Eddington ratios to compare along with the FRADO analytically predicted RL directly to observational data.

All very massive early-type galaxies contain supermassive blackholes but are these blackholes all sufficiently active to produce detectable radio continuum sources? We have used the 887.5~MHz Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey DR1 to measure the radio emission from morphological early-type galaxies brighter than $K_S=9.5$ selected from the 2MASS Redshift Survey, HyperLEDA and RC3. In line with previous studies, we find median radio power increases with infrared luminosity, with $P_{1.4} \propto L_K^{2.2}$, although the scatter about this relation spans several orders of magnitude. All 40 of the $M_K&lt;-25.7$ early-type galaxies in our sample have measured radio flux densities that are more than $2σ$ above the background noise, with $1.4~{\rm GHz}$ radio powers spanning $\sim 3 \times 10^{20}$ to $\sim 3\times 10^{25}~{\rm W~Hz^{-1}}$. Cross matching our sample with integral field spectroscopy of early-type galaxies reveals that the most powerful radio sources preferentially reside in galaxies with relatively low angular momentum (i.e. slow rotators). While the infrared colours of most galaxies in our early-type sample are consistent with passive galaxies with negligible star formation and the radio emission produced by active galactic nuclei or AGN remnants, very low levels of star formation could power the weakest radio sources with little effect on many other star formation rate tracers.

Einstein's General theory of relativity is plagued by cosmological and blackhole type singularities Recently, it has been shown that infinite derivative, ghost free, gravity can yield non-singular cosmological and mini-blackhole solutions. In particular, the theory possesses a {\it mass-gap} determined by the scale of new physics. We will use this property to argue that it is possible to form a non-singular super-massive compact objects without having any event horizon in this class of theories.

Relativistic jets from AGN are an important driver of feedback in galaxies. They interact with their environments over a wide range of physical scales during their lifetime, and an understanding of these interactions is crucial for unraveling the role of supermassive blackholes in shaping galaxy evolution. The impact of such jets have been traditionally considered in the context of heating the large-scale environments. However, in the last few decades there has been additional focus on the immediate impact of jet feedback on the host galaxy itself. In this review we outline the development of various numerical simulations since the onset of studies of jets to the present day, where sophisticated numerical techniques have been employed to study jet feedback including a range of physical processes. The jets can act as an important agent of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well as its star formation. We summarize the recent results from simulations of jet feedback on kpc scales, and outline the broader implications for observations and galaxy evolution.  

Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories

We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordström de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.  

Acceleration of particles by Janis-Newman-Winicour singularities

We examine here the acceleration of particles and high energy collisions in the the Janis-Newman- Winicour (JNW) spacetime, which is an extension of the Schwarzschild geometry when a massless scalar field is included. We show that while the center of mass energy of collisions of particles near the event horizon of a blackhole is not significantly larger than the rest mass of the interacting particles, in an analogous situation, it could be arbitrarily large in the JNWspacetime near the naked singularity. The high energy collisions are seen to be generic in the presence of a photon sphere in the JNW spacetime, whereas an extreme fine-tuning of the angular momentum of the colliding particles is required when the photon sphere is absent. The center of mass energy of collision near the singularity grows slowly for small and extremely large deviations from the Schwarzschild blackhole, but for intermediate strengths of the scalar field it rises moderately fast. As a possible and potentially interesting application, we point out that the presence of such high energy collissions may help the blackhole configurations to be distinguished from a naked singularity.

In this article we provide a new closed relationship between cosmic abundance of primordial gravitational waves and primordial blackholes originated from initial inflationary perturbations for inflection-point models of inflation where inflation occurs below the Planck scale. The current Planck constraint on tensor-to-scalar ratio, running of the spectral tilt, and from the abundance of dark matter content in the universe, we can deduce a strict bound on the current abundance of primordial blackholes to be within a range, $9.99712\times 10^{-3}&lt;Ω_{PBH}h^{2}&lt;9.99736\times 10^{-3}$.

We present a detailed study of a transient in the center of SDSS1115+0544 based on the extensive UV, optical, mid-IR light curves (LC) and spectra over 1200 days. The host galaxy is a quiescent early type galaxy at $z$ = 0.0899 with a blackhole mass of $2\times10^7M_\odot$. The transient underwent a 2.5 magnitude brightening over $\sim120$ days, reaching a peak $V$-band luminosity (extinction corrected) of $-20.9$ magnitude, then fading 0.5 magnitude over 200 days, settling into a plateau of $&gt;600$ days. Following the optical brightening are the significant mid-IR flares at $3.4$ and $4.5μ$m, with a peak time delay of $\sim180$ days. The mid-IR LCs are explained as the echo of UV photons by a dust medium with a radius of $5\times10^{17}$ cm, consistent with $\rm E(B-V)$ of 0.58 inferred from the spectra. This event is very energetic with an extinction corrected $L_{bol} \sim 4\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Optical spectra over 400 days in the plateau phase revealed newly formed broad H$α, β$ emission with a FWHM of $\sim3750$ km s$^{-1}$ and narrow coronal lines such as [Fe VII], [Ne V]. This flare also has a steeply rising UV continuum, detected by multi-epoch $Swift$ data at $+700$ to $+900$ days post optical peak. The broad Balmer lines and the UV continuum do not show significant temporal variations. The slow evolving LCs over 1200 days, the constant Balmer lines and UV continuum at late-times rule out TDE and SN IIn as the physical model for this event. We propose that this event is a `turn-on' AGN, transitioning from a quiescent state to a type 1 AGN with a sub-Eddington accretion rate of $0.017M_\odot$/yr. This change occurred on a very short time scale of $\sim 120- 200$ days. The discovery of such a rapid `turn-on' AGN poses challenges to accretion disk theories and may indicate such event is not extremely rare.

The cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization mark the time period in the universe when stars, galaxies, and blackhole seeds first formed and the intergalactic medium changed from neutral to an ionized one. Despite substantial progress with multi-wavelength observations, astrophysical process during this time period remain some of the least understood with large uncertainties on our existing models of galaxy, blackhole, and structure formation. This white paper outlines the current state of knowledge and anticipated scientific outcomes with ground and space-based astronomical facilities in the 2020s. We then propose a number of scientific goals and objectives for new facilities in late 2020s to mid 2030s that will lead to definitive measurements of key astrophysical processes in the epoch of reionization and cosmic dawn.  

Nonlocal star as a blackhole mimicker

In the context of ghost-free, infinite derivative gravity, we will provide a quantum mechanical framework in which we can describe astrophysical objects devoid of curvature singularity and event horizon. In order to avoid ghosts and singularity, the gravitational interaction has to be nonlocal, therefore, we call these objects as nonlocal stars. Quantum mechanically a nonlocal star is a self-gravitational bound system of many gravitons interacting nonlocally. Outside the nonlocal star the spacetime is well described by the Schwarzschild metric, while inside we have a non-vacuum spacetime metric which tends to be conformally flat at the origin. Remarkably, in the most compact scenario the radius of a nonlocal star is of the same order of the Buchdahl limit, therefore slightly larger than the Schwarzschild radius, such that there can exist a photosphere. These objects live longer than a Schwarzschild blackhole and they are very good absorbers, due to the fact that the number of available states is larger than that of a blackhole. As a result nonlocal stars, not only can be excellent blackhole mimickers, but can also be considered as dark matter candidates. In particular, nonlocal stars with masses below $10^{14}$g can be made stable compared to the age of the Universe.

NGC 1042 is a late type bulgeless disk galaxy which hosts a low luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) coincident with a massive nuclear star cluster. In this paper, we present the integral-field-spectroscopy (IFS) studies of this galaxy, based on the data obtained with the Mitchell spectrograph on the 2.7 meter Harlan J. Smith telescope. In the central $100\textrm{-}300\ \mathrm{pc}$ region of NGC 1042, we find a circumnuclear ring structure of gas with enhanced ionization, which we suggest is mainly induced by shocks. Combining with the harmonic decomposition analysis of the velocity field of the ionized gas, we propose that the shocked gas is the result of gas inflow driven by the inner spiral arms. The inflow velocity is $\sim 32\pm10\ \mathrm{km}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and the estimated mass inflow rate is $\sim 1.1\pm0.3 \times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. The mass inflow rate is about one hundred times the blackhole's mass accretion rate ($\sim 1.4 \times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\ \mathrm{ yr}^{-1}$), and slightly larger than the star formation rate in the nuclear star cluster ($7.94 \times 10^{-4}\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), implying that the inflow material is enough to feed both the AGN activity and the star formation in the nuclear star cluster. Our study highlights that secular evolution can be important in late-type unbarred galaxies like NGC 1042.
