  This paper presents a systematic study of X-ray-selected canonical tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered in the western Galactic hemisphere of the first two eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS1 and eRASS2) performed between Dec 2019 and Dec 2020. We compiled a TDE sample from the catalog of eROSITA's extragalactic transients and variables eRO-ExTra, which includes X-ray sources with a variability significance and fractional amplitude over four between eRASS1 and eRASS2, not associated with known AGNs. Each X-ray source is associated with an optical counterpart from the Legacy Survey DR10. Canonical TDEs were selected based on their X-ray light-curve properties (single flare or decline), soft X-ray spectra ($\Gamma&gt;3$), and the absence of archival X-ray variability and AGN signatures in their host photometry and spectroscopy. The sample includes 31 X-ray-selected TDE candidates with redshifts of $0.02&lt; z&lt;0.34$ and luminosities of $5.7 \times 10^{41}&lt;L_X&lt;5.3 \times 10^{44}$ erg/s in the 0.2-6.0 keV rest frame, of which 30 are canonical TDEs and one is an off-nuclear TDE candidate. The derived X-ray luminosity function is best fit by a double power law with a luminosity break at $10^{44}$ erg/s, corresponding to the Eddington-limiting prediction. This corresponds to a TDE volumetric rate of $ (2.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9})\times10^{-7}\,Mpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ ($\approx1.2\times 10^{-5}$ events per galaxy per year). TDE host galaxies show a green-valley overdensity. In addition, 20%, 30%, and 15% of the sample exhibit flares in the optical, mid-infrared (mid-IR), or radio bands, respectively. We discuss the differences between X-ray, optical, and mid-IR TDE populations and the origins of multiwavelength flares in the context of the obscuring envelope and stream-stream collision models. Finally, we highlight TDE subpopulations that are not included in the canonical sample and should be explored in the future.

  We present an optical variability analysis and comparison of the samples of Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies, selected from the \textit{Swift} 9-month BAT catalog, using the light curves from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). We measured the normalized excess variance of TESS and ASAS-SN light curves for each target and performed a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the two samples, where our results showed significant differences. This is consistent with predictions from the unification model, where Seyfert 2s are obscured by the larger scale dust torus and their variability is suppressed. This variability difference is independent of the luminosity, Eddington ratio, or black hole mass, further supporting geometrical unification models. We searched the dependence of the normalized excess variance of Seyfert 1s on absolute magnitudes, Eddington ratio, and black hole mass, where our results are consistent with relations found in the literature. Finally, a small sub-sample of changing-look AGNs that transitioned during the time frame of the ASAS-SN light curves, with their variability amplitudes changing according to the classification, larger variability as type 1s and smaller as 2s. The change of variability amplitudes can be used to better pinpoint when the type transition occurred. The consistency trend of the variability amplitude differences between Seyfert 1s and 2s and between changing-look AGNs in 1 or 2 stages suggests that variability can be a key factor in shedding light on the changing-look AGN or the dichotomy between Seyfert 1 or 2 populations.

  Accretion flows in both stellar and supermassive black holes show a distinct spectral transition. This is seen directly in binaries and changing look AGN, and also in a recent sample of eROSITA X-ray selected, unobscured AGN where the stacked spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a single black hole mass bin (log $M/M_{\odot} =8-8.5$) clearly show the UV bright disk appearing as the luminosity increases. In binaries, this transition is associated with a change in radio jet, from coupling to the X-ray hot flow with $L_R \propto L_X^{0.7}$ (Fundamental Plane relation), to collapsing when the X-ray hot flow collapses into a disc. We explore the radio behaviour across the transition in our AGN sample by stacking VLASS images. We significantly detect weak radio emission even after subtracting the contribution from star formation in the host galaxy. The residual radio emission remains relatively constant across the transition, despite the mean mass accretion rate changing by a factor 6 and UV flux changing by a factor 100. However, the X-rays change by only a factor 2, giving a constant radio to X-ray flux ratio as predicted by the 'fundamental plane'. We show that this is consistent with these AGN having the same compact radio jet coupling to the X-ray hot flow (not the disc) as in the binaries. The most significant difference is the persistence of the coronal X-rays across the spectral transition in AGN, whereas in binaries the coronal X-rays can be very weak in the disc dominated state.

  Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for regulating galaxy evolution. Motivated by observations of broad absorption line winds from rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we introduce the Mistral AGN feedback model, implemented in the Arepo code. Mistral comes in two versions: continuous radial (Mistral-continuous) and stochastic bipolar momentum deposition (Mistral-stochastic). Using the framework of the IllustrisTNG simulations, we explore the effect of Mistral on BH and galaxy properties, through an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and cosmological zoom simulations run down to $z=2$. Unlike standard thermal AGN feedback prescriptions, Mistral generates galaxy-scale winds that mimic outflows driven by BH accretion. Mistral-continuous produces short-lived galactic fountains, and is inefficient at regulating the growth of massive galaxies at $z=2$. In contrast, Mistral-stochastic efficiently suppresses star formation in massive galaxies, and reproduces the empirical stellar-to-halo mass and ($z=0$) BH-stellar mass relations. By supporting large-scale ($&gt;50\,\rm kpc$) outflows while simultaneously preventing gas inflows, Mistral-stochastic additionally regulates the cold and hot gas fractions at both galaxy and halo scales. Mistral-stochastic therefore works self-consistently across the halo mass range explored $\left(10^{12}-3\times10^{13}\,\rm M_\odot\right)$, without adopting a SMBH-mass dependent AGN feedback scheme such as the one used in IllustrisTNG. Our model is a promising tool for predicting the impact of radiatively efficient AGN winds on galaxy evolution, and interpreting the growing population of high-redshift galaxies and quasars observed by JWST. This work is part of the "Learning the Universe" collaboration, which aims to infer the physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe.

  We report the discovery of 13 broad-line AGNs at $z = 5 - 8$ from the first 10% data of the JWST Cycle 3 Treasury Program COSMOS-3D. These AGNs are identified by their broad H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at $z = 7.646$ with broad H$\beta$ emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest $z &gt; 7.5$ broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes $\beta_{\rm opt}&gt;0$. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their $\beta_{\rm opt}$, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 $\mu$m for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the H$\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \approx 5-6$ and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the $z \approx 4-5$ sample. We also derive the H$\beta$ LF at $z\sim8$ for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad H$\beta$ emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at $z&gt;5$.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been proposed as environments that can facilitate the capture of extreme-mass-ratio binaries and accelerate their inspiral beyond the rate expected from gravitational wave emission alone. In this work, we explore binaries shortly after capture, focusing on the evolution of the binary parameters when the system is still far from merger. We find that repeated interactions with the AGN disk typically reduce both the inclination and semi-major axis of the orbit. The evolution of the eccentricity is more intricate, exhibiting phases of growth and decay. Nevertheless, as the binary gradually aligns with the disk plane, the system tends to circularize. Interestingly, we also identify scenarios where initially highly eccentric, nearly counter-rotating orbits can undergo a rapid transition to co-rotation while maintaining a constant eccentricity. These dynamical effects could have significant implications for the modeling and interpretation of LISA sources.
