  Quasar outflows can play a crucial role in the evolution of their host galaxies through various feedback processes. This effect is expected to be particularly important when the universe was only 2-3 billion years old, during the period known as cosmic noon. By utilizing observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI), we conduct a survey of high-ionization quasar outflows at cosmic noon, with the aim of doubling the current sample of such outflows with distance and energetics determination. We also aim to compare these properties to those derived from spatially resolved outflows in similar quasars probed through Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS). In a sample of 130 quasars we detect signatures of high-ionization outflows in the form of a S IV trough in eight objects. We characterize the physical conditions of these outflows by determining their total hydrogen column density ($N_H$), ionization parameter ($U_H$), and electron number density ($n_e$). The detected outflows show complex kinematic structures with a wide range in blueshifted velocities (100$-$4600 km s$^{-1}$). We locate five out of the eight outflows at distances between 240$-$5500 pc away from the central source. From the combined sample of 15 high-ionization S IV outflows at cosmic noon, we find a high fraction (up to 46 %) of them to be powerful enough to contribute significantly to multi-stage AGN feedback processes. Their mass outflow rates and kinetic luminosities are also found to be consistent with spatially resolved outflows in a luminosity and redshift matched sample of quasars. Comparison with previous spectra reveals interesting variations in some objects, with two cases of emerging high-velocity broad absorption line features with velocities of $-$8000 and $-$39,000 km s$^{-1}$. An impressive case of four line-locked Si IV outflow systems is also revealed in one of the objects.

  We predict the non-thermal pressure (NTP) induced in the cores of galaxy clusters by kinetic jet feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We model a population of Fanaroff-Riley type I jets when sampling power-law distributions in jet power and age, which we evolve in time with a two-phase jet-lobe model. We couple the energy of each jet outburst to the surrounding gas inside spherical shells, allowing us to estimate the fraction of NTP to total pressure induced in the cluster. We predict the mean profile for this NTP fraction over the source population in a variety of cluster environments and for different AGN jet duty cycles. For typical gas and dark matter profiles, the mean NTP fraction peaks at ~4-6% when the AGN jets are active for 10-30% of the total AGN lifecycle. These predictions are in good agreement with observational constraints, suggesting that AGN feedback imparts only small non-thermal contributions to the cluster's core. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the peak in the mean NTP fraction and the AGN jet duty cycle in a given cluster environment. Applying this to Hitomi measurements of the NTP in the Perseus cluster, we infer an AGN jet duty cycle that is consistent with independent evidence of Perseus' AGN jet activity. We propose this as a novel approach for observationally inferring the past AGN activity of real clusters from their observed NTP fraction and environmental profiles.

  We present a search for spatio-temporal clusters in 16 years of Fermi-LAT very high-energy (VHE; $E&gt;100$ GeV) data using the DBSCAN algorithm, focusing on high Galactic latitude ($|b|&gt;10^{\circ}$) clusters with $\geq5$ events and transient doublets (two events within $\leq 3$ days). Of 107 detected clusters, two correspond to previously unidentified VHE sources: weak BL Lacertae objects 4FGL J0039.1-2219 and 4FGL J0212.2-0219, promising targets for next-generation VHE observatories. Due to low VHE photon background, even doublets with a duration of several days exhibited high statistical significance. While most of the 114 detected doublets originated from bright TeV emitters (e.g., Mrk 421, Mrk 501), we identified six VHE flares lacking TeVCat associations. Five of these flares correlate with sources from the Third Catalog of Fermi-LAT High-Energy Sources (3FHL), while one 'orphan' flare lacks a high-energy (HE; $E &gt; 10$ GeV) source counterpart. Some of these flares reached extreme luminosities of $\mathcal{O}(10^{47} \mathrm{erg~s^{-1}})$. No consistent temporal correlation emerged between HE and VHE activity: HE flares preceded, coincided with, or followed VHE emission across sources, with some showing no HE counterpart. Remarkably, 3FHL J0308.4+0408 (NGC 1218) is a Seyfert Type I galaxy, while no object of this class was known VHE emitter before. The 'orphan' flare without any known HE source in the vicinity may originate from NGC 5549, a low-luminosity LINER galaxy. Both sources expand the limited sample of non-blazar AGN detected at VHE energies.

  Galaxy clusters host a hot, diffuse plasma with poorly understood viscosity and magnetic field amplification. Astrophysical plasmas are often modeled with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but low collision rates in environments like the intracluster medium (ICM) hinder thermodynamic equilibrium, causing pressure anisotropies and high viscosity. High-$\beta$ plasmas, dominated by thermal pressure, are prone to instabilities (e.g., firehose, mirror) that limit anisotropy, reduce viscosity, and enable small-scale dynamo-driven magnetic amplification. This study examines viscosity evolution in the ICM during turbulent magnetic field amplification. We performed 3D MHD simulations of forced turbulence with an initially weak, uniform magnetic field. Using the CGL-MHD framework, we incorporate anisotropic pressure dynamics and instability-driven anisotropy limitation. We analyze effective viscosity and dynamo evolution, comparing results with Braginskii-MHD and uniform-viscosity MHD. Results show viscosity decreases over time, allowing magnetic field amplification to saturation levels similar to non-viscous MHD. Viscosity distribution becomes bimodal, reflecting (i) collisional values and (ii) turbulence-dominated values proportional to $10^{-4} L_{\rm turb} U_{\rm turb}$ in unstable regions. At saturation, 60% of plasma retains collisional viscosity. Braginskii-MHD reproduces similar magnetic amplification and viscosity structures. However, uniform-viscosity MHD, where viscosity equals the mean saturated CGL-MHD value, fails to capture the turbulence inertial range. These findings highlight the need for anisotropic viscosity models in studying ICM processes like magnetic topology, cosmic ray transport, and AGN-driven shocks. Moreover, our CGL-MHD and Braginskii-MHD models match the Coma cluster density fluctuation spectrum, reinforcing its weakly collisional nature.

  We report the discovery of a little red dot (LRD), dubbed BiRD ('big red dot'), at $z=2.33$ in the field around the $z=6.3$ quasar SDSSJ1030+0524. Using NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the $F200W-F356W$ color vs $F356W$ magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS spectrum reveals the emission from HeI$\lambda 10830$ and PaG line, both showing a narrow and a broad ($FWHM\gtrsim 2000\ \rm kms^{-1}$) component. The HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI column density in the $2^3S$ level $N\sim 0.5-1.2\times 10^{14}\rm cm^{-2}$, depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of $\Delta v \sim -830\ \rm kms^{-1}$. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8\rm M_{\odot}$ and $L_{\rm bol}\sim 2.9\times 10^{45}\rm ergs^{-1}$, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 ("Rosetta Stone") at $z=2.26$ and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at $z=3.1$. The blueshifted HeI absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at $z&lt;3$ based on JWST data, as a function of $L_{\rm bol}$ and BH mass. The space density is only a factor of $\sim 2-3$ lower than that of UV-selected quasars with comparable $L_{\rm bol}$ and $z$, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to cosmic noon.

  We present 90 GHz continuum imaging of 119 star-forming regions in 30 nearby galaxies observed with MUSTANG-2 on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope as part of the Star Formation in Radio Survey. The 90 GHz data were combined with 3, 15, and 33 GHz data taken previously by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to decompose radio spectra on $\approx$0.8 kpc scales into their synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission components. This was done using three scenarios: (i) a power law fit from 3 to 33 GHz, (ii) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting from 3 to 90 GHz with a thermal dust component, and (iii) MCMC fitting from 3 to 33 GHz without a thermal dust component. For these cases, we find a median thermal (free-free) emission fraction at 33 GHz of (i) $88 \pm 2$% with a scatter of 17%, (ii) $76\pm 3$% with a scatter of 25%, and (iii) $84\pm 2$% with a scatter of 18%. From this we conclude that, on average, free-free, not thermal dust, remains the dominant emission component at 33 GHz. While scenario (ii) yields a thermal fraction that is $\approx$10% larger than scenario (iii), this difference decreases to $\approx$5% after AGN are removed. Consequently, star formation rates measured with thermal fractions at 33 GHz are only mildly biased high without 90 GHz data for the spectral decomposition. Furthermore, a power law fit of data from 3 to 33 GHz still provides a reliable estimate of the free-free emission at 33 GHz.

  We present an extension of the pop-cosmos model for the evolving galaxy population up to redshift $z\sim6$. The model is trained on distributions of observed colors and magnitudes, from 26-band photometry of $\sim420,000$ galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog with Spitzer IRAC $\textit{Ch. 1}&lt;26$. The generative model includes a flexible distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters, and a depth-dependent photometric uncertainty model, both represented using score-based diffusion models. We use the trained model to predict scaling relationships for the galaxy population, such as the stellar mass function, star-forming main sequence, and gas-phase and stellar metallicity vs. mass relations, demonstrating reasonable-to-excellent agreement with previously published results. We explore the connection between mid-infrared emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-formation rate, finding high AGN activity for galaxies above the star-forming main sequence at $1\lesssim z\lesssim 2$. Using the trained population model as a prior distribution, we perform inference of the redshifts and SPS parameters for 429,669 COSMOS2020 galaxies, including 39,588 with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts. The resulting redshift estimates exhibit minimal bias ($\text{median}[\Delta_z]=-8\times10^{-4}$), scatter ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=0.0132$), and outlier fraction ($6.19\%$) for the full $0&lt;z&lt;6$ spectroscopic compilation. These results establish that pop-cosmos can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to forward-model modern wide--deep surveys for Stage IV cosmology. We publicly release pop-cosmos software, mock galaxy catalogs, and COSMOS2020 redshift and SPS parameter posteriors.

  Galaxy groups are more susceptible to feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5) \times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of $2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation. Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.
