  We report on the second observation of the radio-quiet active galactic nucleus (AGN) MCG-05-23-16 performed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The observation started on 2022 November 6 for a net observing time of 640 ks, and was partly simultaneous with NuSTAR (86 ks). After combining these data with those obtained in the first IXPE pointing on May 2022 (simultaneous with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR) we find a 2-8 keV polarization degree $\Pi$ = 1.6 $\pm$ 0.7 (at 68 per cent confidence level), which corresponds to an upper limit $\Pi$ = 3.2 per cent (at 99 per cent confidence level). We then compare the polarization results with Monte Carlo simulations obtained with the MONK code, with which different coronal geometries have been explored (spherical lamppost, conical, slab and wedge). Furthermore, the allowed range of inclination angles is found for each geometry. If the best fit inclination value from a spectroscopic analysis is considered, a cone-shaped corona along the disc axis is disfavoured.

  In this paper we extend the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) to include HI emission. The HI T-RECS model is based on the most recent HI mass function estimates, combined with prescriptions to convert HI mass to total integrated HI flux. It further models source size, morphology and kinematics, including rotational velocity and HI line width. The continuum T-RECS model is updated to improve the agreement with deeper number counts available at 150\,MHz. The model for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is also modified according to the most recent indications of a star formation rate (SFR)--radio luminosity relation, which depends primarily on stellar mass rather than redshift. We further introduce prescriptions to associate an HI mass to the T-RECS radio continuum SFG and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) populations. This gives us a way to meaningfully associate counterparts between HI and continuum catalogues, thus building HI $\times$ continuum simulated observations. Clustering properties of the sources in both HI and continuum are reproduced by associating the galaxies to dark matter haloes of a cosmological simulation. We deliver a set of mock catalogues, as well as the code to produce them, which can be used for simulating observations and predicting results from radio surveys with existing and forthcoming radio facilities, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)   

Jump-starting relativistic flows, and the M87 jet

  We point out the dominant importance of plasma injection effects for relativistic winds from pulsars and black holes. We demonstrate that outside the light cylinder the magnetically dominated outflows while sliding along the helical magnetic field move in fact nearly radially with very large Lorentz factors $\gamma_0 \gg 1 $, imprinted into the flow during pair production within the gaps. Only at larger distances, $r \geq \gamma_0 (c/\Omega)$, the MHD acceleration $\Gamma \propto r$ takes over. As a result, Blandford-Znajek (BZ) driven outflows would produce spine-brightened images, contrary to observations of the edge-brightened jet in M87. We conclude that M87 jet is not BZ-driven. Other implications include: (i) variability time scale of emission even from non-blazar AGNe like M87 and Cen A can be much shorter than the BH spin period; (ii) the model explains blazar-like phenomena in clearly non-aligned AGNe; (iii) in PIC simulations of pulsars' and black holes' magnetospheres with pair production, the pairs should be injected with large Lorentz factors - this would drastically change the resulting magnetospheric and inner-wind structure, if compared with pair injection at rest; (iv) the model resolves the problem of cyclotron absorption in the Crab pulsar wind.   

On the redshift evolution of the baryon and gas fraction in simulated
  groups and clusters of galaxies

  We study the redshift evolution of the baryon budget in a large set of galaxy clusters from the {\it Magneticum} suite of SPH cosmological simulations. At high redshifts, we obtain "closed box" systems independently by the mass of the systems on radii greater than $3R_{500,\mathrm c}$, whereas at lower redshifts, only the most massive halos could be considered as `"closed box". The baryon fraction shows a general decrease with the redshift and, for less massive objects, we observe a much more prominent decrease than for massive halos. The gas depletion parameter $Y_{\rm gas}$ shows a steeper and highly scattered radial distribution in the central regions of less massive halos with respect to massive objects at all redshifts, while on larger radii the gas fraction distributions are independent of the masses or the redshifts. The hot component of the gas traces well the total amount of gas at low redshifts. At higher redshifts, the cold component provides a not negligible contribution to the total amount of baryon in our systems. Moreover, the behaviour of the baryonic, entire gas, and hot gas phase depletion parameters as a function of radius, mass, and redshift are described by some functional forms. The evolution of metallicity and stellar mass in halos suggests that the early enrichment process is dominant. We investigate correlations between the time evolution of AGN feedback and the depletion parameters. We demonstrate that the energy injected by the AGN activity shows a particularly strong positive correlation with $Y_{\rm bar}$, $Y_{\rm cold}$,$Y_{\rm star}$ and a negative one with $Y_{\rm hot}$, $Z_{\rm Tot}$. These trends are consistent with previous works, meaning that our results, combined with findings derived from current and future X-rays observations, represent possible proxies to test the AGN feedback models used in different suites of numerical simulations.   

The signature of galaxy formation models in the power spectrum of the

  Observations of the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen are poised to revolutionize our knowledge of cosmic reionization and the high-redshift population of galaxies. However, harnessing such information requires robust and comprehensive theoretical modeling. We study the non-linear effects of hydrodynamics and astrophysical feedback processes, including stellar and AGN feedback, on the 21cm signal by post-processing three existing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation: Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and Eagle. Overall and despite their different underlying galaxy-formation models, the three simulations return similar predictions for the global 21cm rightness temperature and its power spectrum. At fixed redshift, most differences are attributable to differences in the history of reionization, in turn driven by differences in the build-up of stellar sources of radiation. However, the impact of astrophysics is imprinted in the 21cm power spectrum through several unique signatures. First, we find significant small scale ($k \geq 10\, \rm {Mpc}^{-1}$) differences between Illustris and IllustrisTNG, where higher velocity winds generated by supernova feedback soften density peaks and lead to lower 21cm power in TNG. Second, we find more 21cm power at intermediate scales ($k \approx 0.8\, \rm {Mpc}^{-1}$) in Eagle, due to differences in ionization driven by highly effective stellar feedback, leading to lower star formation, older and redder stellar populations, and thus lower ionizing luminosities. Though subtle, these features could allow future observations of the 21cm signal, in conjunction with other reionization observables, to constrain theoretical models for galactic feedback at high redshift.
