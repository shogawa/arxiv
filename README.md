  Dynamics of stellar mass black holes (sBHs) embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could produce highly eccentric orbits near the central supermassive black hole, leading to repeated close encounters that emit gravitational waves in the LIGO frequency band. Many works have focused on the mergers of sBH in the disk that produce gravitational waves; however, sBHs in hyperbolic orbits also emit gravitational-wave \bremss{} that can be detected by ground-based interferometers like LIGO. In this work, we analyze the scattering of sBHs in an AGN disk as they migrate inside the disk, focusing on gravitational-wave \bremss{} emission. We determine how the gravitational-wave emission depends on the different parameters of the scattering experiments, such as the mass of the supermassive black hole and the sBH migration rate and mass ratio. We find that scattering with detectable gravitational-wave \bremss{} is more frequent around lower mass SMBHs ($\sim 10^{5-6}$M$_\odot$). We then conduct a suite of Monte Carlo simulations and estimated the rate for ground-based gravitational-wave detections to be in the range of 0.08 - 1194 $\text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{ yr}^{-1}$, depending on migration forces and detection thresholds, with large uncertainties accounting for variations in possible AGN environments. The expected rate for our {\tt Fiducial} parameters is 3.2 $\text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{ yr}^{-1}$. Finally, we provide first-principle gravitational wave templates produced by the encounters.

  The low-mass end of low-mass galaxies is largely unexplored in AGN studies, but it is essential for extending our understanding of the black hole-galaxy coevolution. We surveyed the 3D-HST catalog and collected a sample of 546 dwarf galaxies with stellar masses log(M$_*$/\(M_\odot\))$&lt;$8.7, residing in the GOODS-South deep field. We then used the unprecedented depth of Chandra available in the GOODS-South field to search for AGN. We carefully investigated the factors that could play roles in the AGN detectability, such as Chandra's point-spread function and the redshift- and off-axis-dependent detection limits. We identified 16 X-ray sources that are likely associated with AGN activity. Next, we evaluated the environment density of each galaxy by computing tidal indices. We uncovered a dramatic impact of the environment on AGN triggering as dwarfs from high-density environments showed an AGN fraction of 22.5\%, while the median stellar mass of this subset of dwarfs is only log(M$_*$/\(M_\odot\))=8.1. In contrast, the low-density environment dwarfs showed an AGN fraction of only 1.4\%, in line with typically reported values from the literature. This highlights the fact that massive central black holes are ubiquitous even at the lowest mass scales and demonstrates the importance of the environment in triggering black hole accretion, as well as the necessity for deep X-ray data and proper evaluation of the X-ray data quality. Alternatively, even if the detected X-ray sources are related to stellar mass accretors rather than AGN, the environmental dependence persists, signaling the impact of the environment on galaxy evolution and star formation processes at the lowest mass scales. Additionally, we stacked the X-ray images of non-detected galaxies from high- and low-density environments, revealing similar trends.

  We present a multiwavelength analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 795 (z=0.1374), known for its extended (200 kpc) radio emission with a steep spectral index of unclear origin surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and for sloshing features observed by Chandra. We used new JVLA 1.5 GHz, archival GMRT 325 MHz, and XMM-Newton data to investigate the nature of the radio emission and the dynamical state of the intracluster medium. Our X-ray surface brightness analysis revealed an azimuthally asymmetric excess extending to 650 kpc from the center, possibly related to the sloshing spiral, although the existing data did not allow us to confirm the presence of a cold front. We also detected a previously unknown galaxy group located 1 Mpc northwest of the cluster. Its X-ray emission was well fitted by a $\beta$-model ($\beta$=0.52$\pm$0.17), and the spectral analysis revealed a thermal plasma temperature kT=1.08$\pm$0.08 keV and metallicity Z=0.13$\pm$0.06 Z$_{\odot}$. We investigated the possibility that this group acted as the perturber that triggered the sloshing in Abell 795, and we showed that the velocity distribution of member galaxies supports the dynamically unrelaxed nature of Abell 795. The analysis of JVLA 1.5 GHz and GMRT 325 MHz images confirmed the presence of extended radio emission with largest linear size 200 kpc, preferentially extended toward southwest and terminating in a sub-component ("SW blob"). We measured the spectral indices, finding $\alpha_{Ext}$=-2.24$\pm$0.13 for the diffuse extended emission, and $\alpha_{SWb}$=-2.10$\pm$0.13 for the SW blob. These ultra-steep spectral index values, coupled with the complex morphology and cospatiality with the radio-loud AGN present in the BCG, suggest that this emission could be classified as a radio phoenix, possibly arising from adiabatic compression of an ancient AGN radio lobe due to the presence of sloshing motions.

  (Aims) Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of hyper-luminous, heavily obscured quasars. Although nuclear obscurations close to Compton-thick are typical, a fraction show blue UV spectral energy distributions consistent with unobscured quasar activity, albeit two orders of magnitude fainter than expected from their mid-IR luminosity. The origin of the UV emission in these Blue excess Hot DOGs (BHDs) has been linked to scattered light from the central engine. Here we study the properties of the UV emission in the BHD WISE J020446.13-050640.8 (W0204-0506). (Methods) We use imaging polarization observations in the $R_{\rm Special}$ band obtained with the FORS2 instrument at VLT. We compare these data with radiative transfer simulations to constrain the characteristics of the scattering material. (Results) We find a spatially integrated polarization fraction of $24.7\pm 0.7$%, confirming the scattered-light nature of the UV emission of W0204-0506. The source is spatially resolved in the observations and we find a gradient in polarization fraction and angle that is aligned with the extended morphology of the source found in HST/WFC3 imaging. A dusty, conical polar outflow starting at the AGN sublimation radius with a half-opening angle $\lesssim 50~\rm deg$ viewed at an inclination $\gtrsim 45~\rm deg$ can reproduce the observed polarization fraction if the dust is graphite-rich. We find that the gas mass and outflow velocity are consistent with the range of values found for [OIII] outflows through spectroscopy in other Hot DOGs, though it is unclear whether the outflow is energetic enough to affect the long-term evolution of the host galaxy. Our study highlights the unique potential for polarization imaging to study dusty quasar outflows, providing complementary constraints to those obtained through traditional spectroscopic studies.

  The variability mechanisms from jetted AGNs are still under debate. Here the damped random walk (DRW) model, implemented through Gaussian Processe (GPs), is used to fit the $ZTF$ long-term optical light curves of 1684 $\gamma$-ray emission jetted AGNs. This analysis yields one of the largest samples with characteristic optical variability timescales for jetted AGNs. A single DRW model from GPs can fit the optical light curve of most jetted AGNs well/potentially well, while there are still some jetted AGNs whose light curve can not be fitted well by a single DRW model. After the jet power, proxied by gamma-ray luminosity, is introduced as a new parameter, new relationships among intrinsic variability time scales, black hole mass and jet power are discovered for efficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.29^{+0.06}_{-0.06}}P_{\rm jet}^{-0.3^{+0.03}_{-0.03}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.09~dex) and for inefficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.07}}P_{\rm jet}^{0.37^{+0.11}_{-0.11}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.14~dex), respectively. Our results support that the optical variability of jetted AGNs with efficient accretion may originate within the standard accretion disk at UV emitting radii similar to non-jetted AGNs, and is directly related to the acceleration of shock in the jet and then enhanced through the beaming effect in beamed AGNs. For the jetted AGNs with inefficient accretion, the intrinsic timescale is consistent with the escape timescale of electrons.   

An analytic redshift-independent formulation of baryonic effects on the
  matter power spectrum

  Baryonic effects created by feedback processes associated with galaxy formation are an important, poorly constrained systematic effect for models of large-scale structure as probed by weak gravitational lensing. Upcoming surveys require fast methods to predict and marginalize over the potential impact of baryons on the total matter power spectrum. Here we use the FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to test a recent proposal to approximate the matter power spectrum as the sum of the linear matter power spectrum and a constant multiple, $A_{\rm mod}$, of the difference between the linear and non-linear gravity-only power spectra. We show that replacing this constant multiple with a one-parameter family of sigmoid functions of the wavenumber $k$ allows to us match the predictions of simulations with different feedback strengths for $z \leq 1, k &lt; 3~h\cdot{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and the different cosmological models in the FLAMINGO suite. The baryonic response predicted by FLAMINGO models that use jet-like AGN feedback instead of the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback can also be reproduced, but at the cost of increasing the number of parameters in the sigmoid function from one to three. The assumption that $A_{\rm mod}$ depends only on $k$ breaks down for decaying dark matter models, highlighting the need for more advanced baryon response models when studying cosmological models that deviate strongly from $\Lambda$CDM.

  We present an analysis of AGN activity within recently quenched massive galaxies at cosmic noon ($z\sim 2$), using deep Chandra X-ray observations of the Ultra-Deep Survey (UDS) field. Our sample includes over 4000 massive galaxies ($M_\ast &gt; 10^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$) in the redshift range $1 &lt; z &lt; 3$, including more than 200 transitionary post-starburst (PSB) systems. We find that X-ray emitting AGN are detected in $6.2 \pm 1.5$ per cent of massive PSBs at these redshifts, a detection rate that lies between those of star-forming and passive galaxies ($8.2 \pm 0.5$ per cent and $5.7 \pm 0.8$ per cent, respectively). A stacking analysis shows that the average X-ray luminosity for PSBs is comparable to older passive galaxies, but a factor of $2.6 \pm 0.3$ below star-forming galaxies of similar redshift and stellar mass. The average X-ray luminosity in all populations appears to trace the star-formation rate, with PSBs showing low levels of AGN activity consistent with their reduced levels of star formation. We conclude that, on average, we see no evidence for excess AGN activity in the post-starburst phase. However, the low levels of AGN activity can be reconciled with the high-velocity outflows observed in many PSBs, assuming the rare X-ray detections represent short-lived bursts of black hole activity, visible $\sim$5 per cent of the time. Thus, X-ray AGN may help to maintain quiescence in massive galaxies at cosmic noon, but the evidence for a direct link to the primary quenching event remains elusive.
