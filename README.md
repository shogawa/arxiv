  We derive oxygen abundances for two samples of Seyfert 2 (Sy2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected from the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey (KISS). The two samples from KISS include 17 intermediate-redshift (0.29 &lt; z &lt; 0.42) Sy2s detected via their [O III] lines, and 35 low-redshift (z &lt; 0.1), Halpha-detected Sy2s. The primary goal of this work is to explore whether the metallicity distribution of these two samples changes with redshift. To determine the oxygen abundances of the KISS galaxies, we use Cloudy to create a large number of photoionization model grids by varying the temperature of the accretion disk, the ratio of X-ray to UV continuum light, the ionization parameter, the hydrogen density, and the metallicity of the narrow-line region clouds. We link the results of these models to the observed [O III]/H-beta and [N II]/H-alpha emission-line ratios of the KISS sample on the BPT diagram, interpolating across the model grids to derive metallicity. The two redshift samples overlap substantially in terms of derived metal abundances, but we find that some of the intermediate-redshift Sy2 galaxies possess lower abundances than their local universe counterparts. Our analysis provides evidence for modest levels of chemical evolution (0.18 +/- 0.06 dex) over 3-4 Gyrs of look-back time. We compare our results to other AGN abundance derivation methods from the literature.

  The jet cores in blazars are resolved and found to harbour an edge brightened structure where the jet base appears extended at sides compared to its propagation axis. This peculiar phenomenon invites various explanations. We show that the photosphere of an optically thick jet base in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) is observed edge brightened if the jet Lorentz factor harbours an angular dependence. The jet assumes a higher Lorentz factor along the jet axis and decreases following a power law along its polar angle. For an observer near the jet axis, the jet has a lower optical depth along its propagation axis compared to off axis regions. Higher optical depths at the outer region makes the jet photosphere appear to extend to larger radii compared to a deeper photosphere along its propagation axis. We tackle the problem both analytically and numerically, confirming the edge brightening through Monte Carlo simulations. Other than the edge brightening, the outcomes are significant as they provide a unique tool to determine the jet structure and associated parameters by their resolved observed cores. The study paves way to explore the spectral properties of optically thick cores with structured Lorentz factors in the future.

  There is compelling evidence that the most massive galaxies in the Universe stopped forming stars due to the time-integrated feedback from their central super-massive black holes (SMBHs). However, the exact quenching mechanism is not yet understood, because local massive galaxies were quenched billions of years ago. We present JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy observations of GS-10578, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift z=3.064. From the spectrum we infer that the galaxy has a stellar mass of $M_*=1.6\pm0.2 \times 10^{11}$ MSun and a dynamical mass $M_{\rm dyn}=2.0\pm0.5 \times 10^{11}$ MSun. Half of its stellar mass formed at z=3.7-4.6, and the system is now quiescent, with the current star-formation rate SFR&lt;9 MSun/yr. We detect ionised- and neutral-gas outflows traced by [OIII] emission and NaI absorption. Outflow velocities reach $v_{\rm out}\approx$1,000 km/s, comparable to the galaxy escape velocity and too high to be explained by star formation alone. GS-10578 hosts an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), evidence that these outflows are due to SMBH feedback. The outflow rates are 0.14-2.9 and 30-300 MSun/yr for the ionised and neutral phases, respectively. The neutral outflow rate is ten times higher than the SFR, hence this is direct evidence for ejective SMBH feedback, with mass-loading capable of interrupting star formation by rapidly removing its fuel. Stellar kinematics show ordered rotation, with spin parameter $\lambda_{Re}=0.62\pm0.07$, meaning GS-10578 is rotation supported. This study shows direct evidence for ejective AGN feedback in a massive, recently quenched galaxy, thus clarifying how SMBHs quench their hosts. Quenching can occur without destroying the stellar disc.

  We present the results of photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaigns of the changing look AGN NGC~2617 carried out from 2016 until 2022 and covering the wavelength range from the X-ray to the near-IR. The facilities included the telescopes of the SAI MSU, MASTER Global Robotic Net, the 2.3-m WIRO telescope, Swift, and others. We found significant variability at all wavelengths and, specifically, in the intensities and profiles of the broad Balmer lines. We measured time delays of ~ 6 days (~ 8 days) in the responses of the H-beta (H-alpha) line to continuum variations. We found the X-ray variations to correlate well with the UV and optical (with a small time delay of a few days for longer wavelengths). The K-band lagged the B band by 14 +- 4 days during the last 3 seasons, which is significantly shorter than the delays reported previously by the 2016 and 2017--2019 campaigns. Near-IR variability arises from two different emission regions: the outer part of the accretion disc and a more distant dust component. The HK-band variability is governed primarily by dust. The Balmer decrement of the broad-line components is inversely correlated with the UV flux. The change of the object's type, from Sy1 to Sy1.8, was recorded over a period of ~ 8 years. We interpret these changes as a combination of two factors: changes in the accretion rate and dust recovery along the line of sight.
