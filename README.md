  Near-infrared long-slit spectroscopy has been used to study the stellar population (SP) of the low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) and matched analogues (LLAMA) sample. To perform the SP fits we have employed the X-shooter simple stellar population models together with the \st\ code. Our main conclusions are: The star formation history of the AGNs is very complex, presenting many episodes of star formation during their lifetimes. In general, AGN hosts have higher fractions of intermediate-age SP (light-weighted mean ages, $&lt;t&gt;_L\lesssim$ 4.5 Gyr) when compared with their analogues ($&lt;t&gt;_L\lesssim$ 8.0 Gyr). AGN are more affected by reddening and require significant fractions of featureless continuum and hot dust components. The ratio between the AGN radiated energy and the gravitational potential energy of the molecular gas ($E_{Rad}$/$E_{PG}$) for the AGN is compared with the \maL\ and a possible anti-correlation is observed. This suggests that the AGN is affecting the star formation in these galaxies, in the sense that more energetic AGN (log$(E_{Rad}$/$E_{PG}) \gtrsim 3$) tend to host nuclear younger SP ($ &lt;t&gt;_L \lesssim$4Gyr). We found that the recent ($t&lt;$2~Gyr) returned (recycled) stellar mass is higher in AGN than in the controls. We also provide evidence that the mass loss of stars would be enough to feed the AGN, thus providing observational constraints for models that predict that AGN feeding is partially due to the recycled gas from dying stars.

  With an aim to unveil the population of obscured AGN hosted in high-$z$ dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs), we performed X-ray spectral study of $34$ DOGs ($0.59$ $\leq$ $z$ $\leq$ $4.65$) lying within $5.3$ deg$^{2}$ of the XMM-SERVS coverage in the XMM-LSS field. To improve the spectral quality of individual sources, we combined all the existing $\textit{XMM-Newton}$ data and also included $\textit{Chandra}$/ACIS data, whenever available. We find that the X-ray spectra of our DOGs can be fitted with a simple absorbed power law or with a physically-motivated BORUS02 model. The line-of-sight column densities ($N_{\textrm{H}}$) in our sources span across a wide range ($1.02$ $\times$ $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $\leq$ $N_{\textrm{H}}$ $\leq$ $1.21$ $\times$ $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$), with a substantial fraction ($\sim$ $17.6$ per cent) of them being heavily obscured ($N_{\textrm{H}}$ $\geq$ $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$). We also identified one new CT-AGN candidate, yielding the CT-AGN fraction in our sample to be only $3$ per cent. The absorption-corrected $2.0-10$ keV X-ray luminosities of our sources ($2.00~\times~10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ $\leq$ $L_{\textrm{2-10 keV}}^{\textrm{int}}$ $\leq$ $6.17~\times~10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) suggest them to be luminous quasars. The $N_{\textrm{H}}$ versus Eddington ratio diagnostic plot infers that our sample consists of a heterogeneous population that includes a small fraction ($\sim$ $12$ per cent) of DOGs belonging to an early phase (Hot DOGs) during which accretion and obscuration peaks, while the remaining DOGs belong to an intermediate or late phase during which radiative feedback from the dominant AGN blows away surrounding obscuring material.

  We investigate the X-ray properties of a large sample of 71 broad line and narrow line AGN at 2&lt;z&lt;11 discovered by JWST in the GOODS fields, which have the deepest Chandra observations ever obtained. Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -UV spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non-detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN SED. Heavy X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton thick) column density and low dust content, such as the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasar; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of Halpha in JWST-selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack the prominent, fast outflows characterizing low-z AGN and luminous quasars, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST-selected AGN match the definition of NLSy1, typically characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum, and this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to Very Massive Stars, Tidal Disruption Events, or Supernovae, although we show that a minority of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with the echo of superluminous SNe or TDE. Scenarios in which the broad lines are ascribed to galactic outflows are also untenable. We emphasize that confirming any of the scenarios discussed above will require X-ray missions more sensitive than Chandra. (abridged)

  NGC 4278, a Low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), is generally classified as a low-ionization nuclear emission line region (LINER) type AGN. Recently, it is reported to be associated with a very high energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray source 1LHAASO J1219+2915 in the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) source catalog. However, no associated counterpart has been detected by Fermi-LAT. By analyzing its X-ray observation data from Swift-XRT, we find it is in a high-flux state on MJD 59546, with the X-ray flux more than one order of magnitude higher than that observed $\sim$ 11.7 year earlier by Chandra. We propose that the detection of VHE $\gamma$-rays from NGC 4278 may be attributed to the presence of an active nucleus displaying behavior similar to that of a BL Lac. To reproduce its spectral energy distribution (SED), we employ a one-zone leptonic model, typically used for fitting broadband SEDs of BL Lacs, and find that smaller values for both Doppler factor ($\delta$) and magnetic field strength ($B$) are required than that of typical TeV BL Lacs. Furthermore, NGC 4278 exhibits significantly lower luminosity in both radio and TeV bands when compared with typical TeV BL Lacs. In the radio-luminosity vs. Eddington-ratio plane, NGC 4278 shows greater similarity to Seyfert galaxies and LINERs rather than BL Lacs; however, it still roughly follows the extension towards lower luminosity seen in BL Lacs.

  Nascent planets are thought to lose angular momentum (AM) to the gaseous protoplanetary disk (PPD) via gravitational interactions, leading to inward migration. A similar migration process also applies to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in AGN disks. However, AM exchange via accretion onto the planet/BH may strongly influence the migration torque. In this study, we perform 2D global hydrodynamic simulations of an accreting planet/BH embedded in a disk, where AM exchange between the planet/BH and disk via gravity, accretion, pressure and viscosity are considered. When accretion is turned off, we recover the linear estimate for Type I migration torque. However, in all of our accreting simulations, we find outward migration due to the positive AM deposited onto the accreting body by the disk gas. Our simulations achieve the global steady state for the transport of mass and AM: The mass and AM fluxes are constant across the disk except for jumps ($\Delta\dot M$ and $\Delta\dot J$) at the planet's location, and the jumps match the accretion rate and torque on the planet. Our findings suggest that extra caution is needed when applying the standard results of disk migration to accreting planets and BHs.

  The spatial scales of relativistic radio jets, probed by relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic jet launching simulations (RMHDs) and by most very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations differ by an order of magnitude. Bridging the gap between these RMHD simulations and VLBI observations requires selecting nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), the parsec-scale region of which can be resolved. 3C 84 is a nearby bright AGN fulfilling the necessary requirements: it is launching a powerful, relativistic jet powered by a central supermassive black hole, while also being very bright. Using 22 GHz global VLBI measurements of 3C 84 we aim to study its sub-parsec region in both total intensity and linear polarisation, to explore the properties of this jet, with a linear resolution of $\sim0.1$ parsec. We test different simulation setups by altering the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ of the jet, as well as the magnetic field configuration (toroidal, poloidal, helical). We confirm the persistence of a limb brightened structure, which reaches deep into the sub-parsec region. The corresponding electric vector position angles (EVPAs) follow the bulk jet flow inside but tend to be orthogonal to it near the edges. Our state-of-the-art RMHD simulations show that this geometry is consistent with a spine-sheath model, associated with a mildly relativistic flow and a toroidal magnetic field configuration.
