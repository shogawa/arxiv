We performed a search for fast X-ray transients (FXTs), with durations longer than one second and less than one day, through data of the Wide Field Camera (WFC) instrument onboard the BeppoSAX X-ray observatory collected between June 1996 and April 2002. (..) We focused our search on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), X-ray flashes (XRFs), X-ray flares from high-mass X-ray binaries and stellar flares, while Type-I and II X-ray bursts from Galactic neutron stars were excluded. 149 such fast transient events were detected. 63 of these are new to the literature. 38 flares are identified with 22 nearby stars. Three stars have never been seen flaring before in X-rays or optical (NLTT 51688, GR Dra and UCAC4 255-003783). We find that the MeV transient GRO J1753+57 is most likely the same object as GR Dra rather than an AGN as previously thought. Eleven flares were detected from known high-mass X-ray binaries with irregular wind accretion (four of which are of the subclass of supergiant fast X-ray transients). 100 GRBs were identified of which 24 have not been published before. We classify 37% of the X-ray detected GRBs as XRFs with relatively large X-ray to gamma-ray flux ratio, gamma-rays being measured with the BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor. The duration/spectral hardness distribution of all FXTs is bimodal, separating the group roughly in transients shorter and longer than 1 ksec and with relatively hard and soft spectra, respectively. We identify the 'short' FXTs as GRBs and XRFs and the `long' FXTs as flares from nearby late-type stars and X-ray binaries. The BeppoSAX-WFC FXT sample is found to be consistent with the one observed by Einstein Probe, when the sensitivity of the two instruments is taken into account.

Dual active galactic nuclei (DAGN) mark an observable stage of massive black hole (MBH) pairing in galaxy mergers and are precursors to the MBH binaries that generate low-frequency gravitational waves. Using the large-volume ASTRID cosmological simulation, we construct DAGN catalogs matched to current (COSMOS-Web, DESI) and forthcoming (AXIS, Roman) searches. With realistic selection functions applied, ASTRID reproduces observed dual fractions, separations, and host-galaxy properties across redshifts. We predict a substantial population of small-separation (&lt;5 kpc) duals that current surveys fail to capture, indicating that the apparent paucity of sub-kpc systems in COSMOS-Web is driven primarily by selection effects rather than a physical deficit. By following each simulated dual forward in time, we show that dual AGN are robust tracers of MBH mergers: ~30-70% coalesce within $\lesssim 1$ Gyr, and 20-60% of these mergers produce gravitational-wave signals detectable by LISA. Duals accessible to AXIS and Roman are the progenitors of ~10% of low-redshift LISA events and ~30% of the PTA-band stochastic background. Massive green-valley galaxies with moderate-luminosity AGN, together with massive star-forming hosts containing bright quasars at $z&gt;1$, emerge as the most likely environments for imminent MBH binaries. These results provide a unified cosmological framework linking dual AGN demographics, MBH binary formation, and gravitational-wave emission, and they identify concrete, high-priority targets for coordinated electromagnetic and GW searches in upcoming multi-messenger surveys.

We report on the very first radio detection associated with the peculiar hourglass-morphology X-rays surrounding 3C 294 at z=1.8. Using International Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) data at 144 MHz and Chandra data at 0.3-6 keV, we find that the co-spatial diffuse radio and X-ray emission is well described by synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes by the same electron population. Through modelling of this rare low-energy plasma, we find that the most defining property of the electrons up-scattering CMB photons at this redshift is very low electron Lorentz factors ($γ_{\text{max}}\ll 10^{4}$ and $γ_{\text{break}}\lesssim 10^{3}$) in the lobe: deep low frequency (&lt;150 MHz) observations are critical to the detection of radio lobes at high redshift. The physical conditions imply a total energy in the diffuse emission significantly greater than that implied by the temperature of the protocluster gas: 3C 294 is one of the most powerful known radio-loud systems in a dense protocluster environment. Through resolved spectral analysis of archival radio data up to 15 GHz, we find evidence that the inner hotspots are due to restarted activity, while the outer hotspots remain energetic, suggesting a rapid duty cycle while the jet precesses. This allowed the low-energy aged plasma driving the X-rays to remain spatially distinct from the high-energy plasma. Together, our results promise a revelation of AGN-related radio emission at high redshift using future low-frequency arrays such as SKA-LOW.

We investigated the James Webb Space Telescope photometric color classification of mid-infrared (MIR) selected galaxies at high redshifts, toward cosmic noon. The aim of the present work is to obtain a z-dependent mid-infrared (MIR) photometric galaxy classification tool based on broad spectral emission and absorption lines using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and its broadband filters. We used the largest Spitzer MIR spectral database to obtain synthetic photometry in the JWST/MIRI filters. We formed MIRI filter combinations to trace the strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features and the 9.7 micron silicate feature in seven redshift windows from z = 0.25-2.10. Results. We present z-dependent MIRI color-color plots that separate active galactic nuclei (AGN), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and silicate absorption-dominated galaxies up to z$\sim$2. We applied the photometric MIR colors to the largest ($\sim$34 arcmin square) MIRI survey called the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), to identify AGN, SFGs, and Si-absorption dominated galaxies out to substantial redshifts. Our JWST/MIRI SFGs sample includes galaxies with total IR luminosities of $10^{9.2} \sim 10^{11.9} L_{\odot}$ at 0.9 $\leq$z &lt; 1.57. The majority of them are consistent with the z$\sim$1 main sequence. We also identified the first examples of z$\sim$1 galaxies with deep silicate absorption.

The semi-forbidden CIII] $λλ$1907,1909 doublet is a key tracer of high-ionization emission in the early universe. We present a study of CIII] emission in galaxies at z=5-7, using publicly available JWST/NIRSpec prism data from programs including CEERS, JADES, RUBIES and CAPERS. We built a sample of 61 CIII]-emitting galaxies, and we classified them as star-forming or active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using (1) rest-frame UV and optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, and (2) the presence/absence of broad Balmer emission lines. The UV diagnostics are based on the combination of the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of CIII] versus CIII]/HeII $λ$1640, and the EW of CIV versus CIV/HeII $λ$1640. For optical diagnostics, we employ the OHNO diagram, which combines [OIII] $λ$5007, H$β$, [NeIII] $λ$3869, and [OII] $λλ$3727,3729- and we find it has a low efficiency on separating AGN from SFG. We find that half of the sources in our sample (29 out of 61 galaxies) exhibit at least one secure indication of AGN activity while 13 are potential AGNs based on the CIII] diagnostic. Physical properties, including stellar mass and star formation rate, are derived through spectral energy distribution modeling with Bagpipes. Our analysis reveals that JWST is uncovering a population of strong CIII] emitters at high redshift (5&lt;z&lt;7) with a median EW of 22.8 A. This EW is higher than that of a control sample of CIII] emitters at redshift 3&lt;z&lt;4 with a median EW of 4.7 A. We find that for the same range of Muv, the CIII] EW increases by $\sim$0.67 dex from 3&lt;z&lt;4 to 5&lt;z&lt;7, indicating strong redshift evolution in the line's strength. Finally, we identify five sources in our sample as Little Red Dots (LRDs); while four of these have already been identified as LRD in the literature, one is presented here for the first time.  

The dominant role of dark matter halo in quenching central galaxies

Understanding the quenching of star formation in central galaxies remains a core challenge in galaxy evolution. Two decades ago, the concept of halo quenching was introduced as a dominant mechanism, positing that massive central galaxy quenching is governed by the thermodynamics of gas predominantly influenced by dark matter halos. However, a vastly increasing body of observational evidence consistently indicates that quenching correlates predominantly with central properties like velocity dispersion, bulge mass, and black hole mass. When these properties are controlled, halo mass appears to show weak influence, supporting AGN feedback as the primary mechanism. A recurring key issue, however, is that these studies rely on halo masses derived via abundance matching (AM). Direct observational measurements from weak lensing, satellite kinematics, and galactic dynamics reveal that AM systematically overestimates halo masses of star-forming centrals while underestimating those of passive ones. To accurately assess the true role of halo mass. we re-estimated halo masses for SDSS groups; the resulting halo mass function and stellar-to-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for both populations match theoretical predictions and weak lensing measurements. Using these improved masses, we find direct observational evidence that halo mass is the dominant factor in quenching central galaxies, with a clear threshold at $M_{h}\sim 10^{12.1}M_\odot; $. By applying a simple correction to AM data using weak lensing-derived SHMRs, we demonstrate that previous claims regarding the dominance of central properties stem primarily from systematic biases in AM halo masses. Our results suggest that the significance of AGN feedback is primarily manifested in halos above this mass threshold, in galaxies already primed for quenching. In other words, AGN feedback appears to become effective in halos above this mass threshold.

JWST has uncovered a substantial population of Massive ($M_{\star} \gtrsim 10^{10 }\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), Quenched Galaxies (MQGs) in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim 2$), whose properties challenge current galaxy formation models. In this paper, we examine this population of MQGs within the new COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We report number densities and stellar mass functions in broad agreement with the latest observations. The predicted quenching and formation timescales are qualitatively consistent with observational inferences. Leveraging the state-of-the-art physics in COLIBRE, the model predicts that MQGs have dust and $\rm H_{2}$ fractions more than $1$ dex lower than their massive star-forming counterparts; while their sizes and kinematics remain broadly similar. We further explore the processes driving galaxies to become massive and quenched in COLIBRE, identifying active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback as the primary quenching mechanism. Compared to star-forming galaxies of similar mass, MQGs host more massive black holes (BHs) and exhibit higher star formation efficiencies. These differences arise from their environments, particularly at local ($\rm 0.3\,cMpc$) to intermediate scales ($\rm 1.0\,cMpc$) before quenching, where overdense regions are associated with enhanced gas inflows, higher BH accretion and, hence, feedback power. We find that about $55\%$ of MQGs survive as the main progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies when they are selected at $z=3$, although up to $55\%$ experience rejuvenation episodes. Our results provide robust predictions for MQGs, show that tensions with observations are reduced when an effective observational uncertainty is forward-modelled, and clarify the mechanisms behind their origin.

How a seemingly `dead' host galaxy provides fuel for its active galactic nuclei (AGN) remains an unresolved problem. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we present a new high-sensitivity atomic-hydrogen (HI) observation toward the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 4278 and its adjacent region. From the observation, we found that external gas accretion from a neighbouring galaxy fuels the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278 through tidal interactions. The accreted gas entering NGC 4278 exhibits a rotating gas disk. And the accreted galaxy has been gas-poor and has an HI to stellar mass ratio of about 0.02. Due to the process of gas accretion, it is likely that relativistic jets are generated in the AGN of NGC 4278. The emission of TeV gamma rays in NGC 4278 is likely to be associated with the newly accreted HI gas.

One of JWST's most unexpected discoveries is the emergence of "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs): compact sources at $z \gtrsim 3$ with blue rest-frame UV continua, red optical slopes, and broad Balmer emission lines that challenge standard models and suggest a population of early, unusual active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using a comprehensive photometric selection and public NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy across six JWST deep fields, we identify a large sample of 118 LRDs with high-S/N spectra, enabling a population-wide analysis of their UV--optical continuum and emission lines. We find clear correlations between rest-frame color ([0.3-0.9\,$μ$m]) and slopes: bluer LRDs have blue UV slopes ($β_{ν,\mathrm{UV}} \sim 0.3$) and red optical slopes, while redder LRDs exhibit redder UV slopes ($β_{ν,\mathrm{UV}} \sim 1.1$). The continuum shape shows a similar trend: redder LRDs display prominent Balmer breaks and curvature, while bluer LRDs follow power-law-like optical SEDs. From literature compilations, $\sim$60% of known broad-line AGNs satisfy our LRD criteria, and up to 90% of LRDs show broad Balmer lines. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a shift from high H$_α$/H$_β$ and low [OIII]$\lambda5007$/H$_β$ in redder LRDs to the opposite in bluer ones, along with stronger narrow-line equivalent widths, suggesting a transition from AGN- to host-dominated emission. We fit the spectra with a two-component model combining a gas-enshrouded black hole (BH) and a galaxy host. Redder LRDs require higher-luminosity, unreddened BHs and modestly reddened hosts; bluer LRDs require lower-luminosity, reddened BHs and dust-free galaxies. This framework reproduces the diversity in colors and spectral shape by varying BH luminosity, obscuration, and host-to-BH luminosity ratio.

Interpreting multi-messenger signals from neutron stars and black holes requires reliable general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations across rapidly evolving high-performance-computing platforms, yet key algorithms are routinely rewritten within infrastructure-specific numerical-relativity codes, hindering verification and reuse. We present the General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Library (GRHayL), a modular, infrastructure-agnostic GR(M)HD library providing conservative-to-primitive recovery, reconstruction, flux/source and induction operators, equations of state, and neutrino leakage through an intuitive interface. GRHayL refactors and extends the mature IllinoisGRMHD code into reusable pointwise and stencil-wise kernels, enabling rapid development and cross-code validation in diverse frameworks, while easing adoption of new microphysics and future accelerators. We implement the same kernels in the Einstein Toolkit (Carpet and CarpetX) and BlackHoles@Home, demonstrating portability with minimal duplication. Validation combines continuous-integration unit tests with cross-infrastructure comparisons of analytic GRMHD Riemann problems, dynamical Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff evolutions, and binary neutron-star mergers, showing comparable or improved behavior over legacy IllinoisGRMHD and established Einstein Toolkit codes.  

From ASTRID to BRAHMA -- The role of overmassive black holes in little red dots in cosmological simulations

We leverage the overmassive black holes ($\rm M_{BH}/M_{\ast} \approx0.1$) present in a realization of the BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite to investigate their role in the emission of the unique ``little red dot'' (LRD) objects identified by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be $\rm 2.04 \pm 0.32 \times 10^{-4} \space Mpc^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation ($\rm A_V = 0.21 \pm 0.12$), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations.
