  We investigate AGN feedback from an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, by performing isolated galaxy simulations using a modified version of the GADGET-3 code. We consider Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group as our simulation reference model. Beginning with black hole seeds ranging from $10^3$ to $10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, our simulations focus on comparing stellar-only feedback with AGN+stellar/SN feedback over 13.7 Gyr of galactic evolution. Our results indicate that a low-mass AGN in a dwarf galaxy influences the star formation history under specific physical conditions. While AGN feedback is generally negative on star formation, instances of positive feedback were also identified. Despite measurable effects on the evolution of the dwarf host galaxy, black hole seeds exhibited only marginal growth. We tested several physical scenarios as modified models in our simulations, primarily concerning the dynamics of the central black holes, which may wander within dwarf galaxies rather than being centrally located. However, none of these adjustments significantly impacted the growth of the black hole seeds. This suggests that intermediate-mass black holes may struggle to achieve higher masses in isolated environments, with mergers and interactions likely playing crucial roles in their growth. Nevertheless, AGN feedback exhibited non-negligible effects in our simulated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, despite the assumed dominant role of stellar feedback in the low-mass regime.

  Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type 0 radio galaxies are a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) that lack extended kpc-scale jets, different from the classical FRI and FRII radio galaxies. They constitute the most abundant population of radio galaxies in the local Universe (z&lt;0.1), yet remain largely unexplored. VLBI observations of a limited number of FR0s demonstrated that their central supermassive black hole (SMBH) are able to lunch mostly two-sided jets, with mildly relativistic bulk speed. In this work, we highlight the need of further high-resolution radio observations to probe the jet structures of these compact radio galaxies, by showing exploratory results of our EVN+eMERLIN observation campaign of FR0s. A preliminary analysis of these recent data reveals a possible change of the jet direction at different scales. We shortly discuss their physical conditions to explain the observed jet compactness, stressing the role of the SMBH spin vector in shaping their radio morphology

  It is known for long that the observed mass surface density of cored dark matter (DM) halos is approximately constant, independently of the galaxy mass (i.e., rhoc X rc simeq constant}, with rhoc and rc the central volume density and the radius of the core, respectively). Here we review the evidence supporting this empirical fact as well as its theoretical interpretation. It seems to be an emergent law resulting from the concentration-halo mass relation predicted by the current cosmological model, where the DM is made of collisionless cold DM particles (CDM). We argue that the prediction rhoc X rc simeq constant is not specific to this particular model of DM but holds for any other DM model (e.g., self-interacting) or process (e.g., stellar or AGN feedback) that redistributes the DM within halos conserving its CDM mass. In addition, the fact that rhoc X rc simeq constant is shown to allow the estimate of the core DM mass and baryon fraction from stellar photometry alone, particularly useful when the observationally-expensive conventional spectroscopic techniques are unfeasible.

  Context. Blazars are a distinct subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known for their fast variability, high polarization, and intense emission across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Gamma-ray blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCU) are an ongoing challenge in gamma-ray astronomy due to difficulties in classification and redshift determination. Aims. This study continues an optical spectroscopic campaign aimed at identifying the characteristics of BCUs to improve classification and redshift estimates, particularly focusing on low-synchrotron-peak sources. Methods. We conducted a detailed analysis of optical spectroscopic data for a sample of 21 low-synchrotron-peak BCUs plus one bl lac with contradictory results in the literature, using the 3.58-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain). Results. Our analysis identifies 14 out of the 21 BCUs as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), demonstrating the effectiveness of our selection criteria. Notably, four FSRQs have redshifts exceeding 1, including 4FGL J2000.0+4214 at z = 2.04. Six sources are classified as bl lacs, with one of them, 4FGL J0746.5-0719, showing a featureless spectrum in this work despite previously exhibiting strong lines, suggesting it may be a changing-look blazar. One source remains classified as a BCU due to a noisy spectrum. Additionally, we observed a bl lac object, 4FGL J1054.5+2211, due to inconsistent redshift estimates in the literature, but we could not confirm any redshift due to its featureless spectrum. Our findings provide insights into the classification and redshift estimation of blazar candidates, emphasizing the need for continued spectroscopic monitoring.

  We present 6 GHz e-MERLIN observations of 42 $z&lt;0.2$ type 1 and type 2 mostly radio-quiet quasars ($L_{\rm[OIII]}\gtrsim10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$; $L_{\rm AGN}\gtrsim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) from the Quasar Feedback Survey. The nature and origin of radio emission in these types of sources is typically ambiguous based on all-sky, low-resolution surveys. With e-MERLIN, we investigate radio emission on sub-kiloparsec scales ($\sim$10s-100s pc). We find 37/42 quasars are detected, with a diversity of radio morphologies, including compact cores, knots and extended jet-like structures, with sizes of 30-540 pc. Based on morphology and brightness temperature, we classify 76 per cent of the quasars as radio-AGN, compared to the $\sim$57 per cent identified as radio-AGN at the $\sim$1-60 kpc scales probed in prior studies. Combining results from e-MERLIN and the Very Large Array, 86 per cent reveal a radio-AGN. On average, $\sim$60 per cent of the total radio flux is resolved away in the e-MERLIN maps, and is likely dominated by jet-driven lobes and outflow-driven shocks. We find no significant differences in measured radio properties between type 1 and type 2 quasars, and estimate sub-relativistic jet speeds of $\sim$0.2-0.3c and modest jet powers of $P_\mathrm{jet} \approx \times$10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the few targets, where these measurements were possible. These quasars share characteristics with compact radio-selected populations, and the global radio emission likely traces strong interactions between the AGN (jets/outflows) and their host galaxy ISM from 10s parsec to 10s kiloparsec scales.

  We present Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations from the Hubble Space Telescope of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of PKS0745-191, a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) undergoing powerful radio-mode AGN feedback ($P_{\rm cav}\sim5\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$). These high-resolution data offer the first spatially resolved map of gas dynamics within a SMBHs sphere of influence under such powerful feedback. Our results reveal the presence of highly chaotic, non-rotational ionized gas flows on sub-kpc scales, in contrast to the more coherent flows observed on larger scales. While radio-mode feedback effectively thermalizes hot gas in galaxy clusters on kiloparsec scales, within the core, the hot gas flow may decouple, leading to a reduction in angular momentum and supplying ionized gas through cooling, which could enhance accretion onto the SMBH. This process could, in turn, lead to a self-regulating feedback loop. Compared to other BCGs with weaker radio-mode feedback, where rotation is more stable, intense feedback may lead to more chaotic flows, indicating a stronger coupling between jet activity and gas dynamics. Additionally, we observe a sharp increase in velocity dispersion near the nucleus, consistent with a very massive $M_{\rm BH}\sim1.5\times10^{10} M_\odot$ SMBH. The density profile of the ionized gas is also notably flat, paralleling the profiles observed in X-ray gas around galaxies where the Bondi radius is resolved. These results provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, highlighting the intricate relationship between SMBH fueling and AGN feedback within the host galaxy.

  X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a novel mode of variability in nearby galactic nuclei whose origin remains unknown. Their multi-wavelength properties are poorly constrained, as studies have focused almost entirely on the X-ray band. Here we report on time-resolved, coordinated Hubble Space Telescope far ultraviolet and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the shortest period X-ray QPE source currently known, eRO-QPE2. We detect a bright UV point source ($L_{\rm FUV} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) that does not show statistically significant variability between the X-ray eruption and quiescent phases. This emission is unlikely to be powered by a young stellar population in a nuclear stellar cluster. The X-ray-to-UV spectral energy distribution can be described by a compact accretion disk ($R_{\rm out} = 343^{+202}_{-138} \ R_{\rm g}$). Such compact disks are incompatible with typical disks in active galactic nuclei, but form naturally following the tidal disruption of a star. Our results rule out models (for eRO-QPE2) invoking i) a classic AGN accretion disk and ii) no accretion disk at all. For orbiter models, the expected radius derived from the timing properties would naturally lead to disk-orbiter interactions for both quasi-spherical and eccentric trajectories. We infer a black hole mass of log$_{10}(M_{\rm BH}) = 5.9 \pm 0.3$ M$_{\odot}$ and Eddington ratio of 0.13$^{+0.18}_{-0.07}$; in combination with the compact outer radius this is inconsistent with existing disk instability models. After accounting for the quiescent disk emission, we constrain the ratio of X-ray to FUV luminosity of the eruption component to be $L_{\rm X} / L_{\rm FUV} &gt; 16-85$ (depending on the intrinsic extinction).

  Wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals (wet EMRIs), which arise from stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) inspiral into supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the gas-rich environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for space-borne detectors like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Unlike "dry EMRIs", which form through gravitational scattering in nuclear star clusters, wet EMRIs are naturally accompanied by interactions with accretion disks, offering rich multi-messenger science opportunities. They are distinct in generating transient electromagnetic (EM) signals, such as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which serve as valuable probes of accretion disk physics and SMBH environments. Their GW signals provide an unprecedented precision of the order of $O(10^{-4}\sim 10^{-6})$ in measuring SMBH mass and spin, enabling the calibration of traditional EM techniques and offering insights into jet formation models. Additionally, wet EMRIs serve as bright and dark sirens for cosmology, facilitating percent-level precision measurements of Hubble parameter through AGN host identification or statistical association. These systems hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of black hole dynamics, accretion physics, and cosmology.
