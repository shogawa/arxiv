  The active galactic nucleus (AGN) within M87, a giant elliptical galaxy, is responsible for one of the closest kiloparsec-scale relativistic jet to Earth. We unearthed unpublished M87 polarization maps taken with the Faint Object Camera (FOC) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), obtained between 1995 and 1999. At a rate of one observation per year, we can follow the evolution of the polarized flux knots in the jet. We can thus constrain the time scale of variation of the magnetic field up to a spatial resolution of one tenth of an arcsecond (11.5 pc). After coherently reducing the five observations using the same methodology presented in the first paper of this series, the analysis of polarized maps from POS 1 (base of the jet) and POS 3 (end of the jet) reveals significant temporal and spatial dynamics in the jet's magnetic fields morphology. Despite minimal changes in overall intensity structure, notable fluctuations in polarization degrees and angles are detected across various knots and inter-knot regions. In addition, the emission and polarization characteristics of M87's jet differ significantly between POS1 and POS3. POS1 shows a more collimated jet with strong variability in polarization, while POS3 reveals a thicker structure, a quasi-absence of variability and complex magnetic field interactions. This suggests that the jet may have co-axial structures with distinct kinetic properties. Theoretical models like the jet-in-jet scenario, featuring double helical magnetic flux ropes, help explain these observations, indicating a strong density contrast and higher speeds in the inner jet.

  We present the pc-scale radio spectra of a representative sample of 13 Palomar-Green (PG) radio-quiet quasars (RQQ), based on our new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 8.4 and 23.6 GHz and our earlier VLBA studies at 1.5 and 5.0 GHz. The radio core emission generally exhibits a flat spectrum at 1.5-5.0 GHz, which indicates a compact optically thick synchrotron source with a size extending down to at least the broad-line region (BLR) radius R_BLR ~0.01-0.1 pc. In comparison, the 8.4-23.6 GHz spectral slope remains flat in four objects indicating the inner radius of the radio source R_in &lt; 0.1 R_BLR, and becomes steep in another four objects indicating R_in ~0.5 R_BLR. The flat 8.4-23.6 GHz slope sources may be associated with a continuous flow, starting at the accretion disk corona and expanding outwards. The steep 8.4-23.6 GHz slope sources may be produced by an interaction of an AGN-driven wind with the BLR gas or a low-power jet extending to the BLR scale. The Eddington ratio L/L_Edd in seven of the eight objects with a flat or steep 8.4-23.6 GHz slope is low (&lt; 0.3). In contrast, the L/L_Edd in four of the remaining five objects, which the 8.4-23.6 GHz slope can not be significantly constrained, is high (&gt; 0.3), suggesting a radiation pressure driven wind. Future sub-millimeter observations can further constrain the inward radial extent of the radio emission down to the coronal scale.

  The theoretical model suggests that relativistic jets of AGN rely on the black hole spin and/or accretion. We study the relationship between jet, accretion, and spin using supermassive black hole samples with reliable spin of black holes. Our results are as follows: (1) There is a weak correlation between radio luminosity and the spin of black hole for our sample, which may imply that the jet of the supermassive black hole in our sample depends on the other physical parameters besides black hole spins, such as accretion disk luminosity. (2) The jet power of a supermassive black hole can be explained by the hybrid model with magnetic field of corona. (3) There is a significant correlation between radio-loudness and black hole spin for our sample. These sources with high radio-loudness tend to have high black hole spins. These results provide observational evidence that the black hole spin may explain the bimodal phenomena of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN.

  The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is dedicated to exploring critical scientific domains including the indirect detection of dark matter, cosmic ray physics, and gamma ray astronomy. This study introduces a novel method for calibrating the Point Spread Function (PSF) of DAMPE, specifically designed to enhance the accuracy of gamma-ray observations. By leveraging data from regions near pulsars and bright Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), we have refined the PSF calibration process, resulting in an improved angular resolution that closely matches our observational data. This advancement significantly boosts the precision of gamma-ray detection by DAMPE, thereby contributing to its mission objectives in dark matter detection and gamma ray astronomy.

  The growing volume of data produced by large astronomical surveys necessitates the development of efficient analysis techniques capable of effectively managing high-dimensional datasets. This study addresses this need by demonstrating some applications of manifold learning and dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), on the optical+NIR SED space of galaxies, with a focus on sample comparison, selection biases, and predictive power using a small subset. To this end, we utilize a large photometric sample from the five CANDELS fields and a subset with spectroscopic measurements from the KECK MOSDEF survey in two redshift bins at $z\sim1.5$ and $z\sim2.2$. We trained SOM with the photometric data and mapped the spectroscopic data onto it as our study case. We found that MOSDEF targets do not cover all SED shapes existing in the SOM. Our findings reveal that Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) within the MOSDEF sample are mapped onto the more massive regions of the SOM, confirming previous studies and known selection biases towards higher-mass, less dusty galaxies. Furthermore, SOM were utilized to map measured spectroscopic features, examining the relationship between metallicity variations and galaxy mass. Our analysis confirmed that more massive galaxies exhibit lower [OIII]/H$\beta$ and [OIII]/[OII] ratios and higher H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios, consistent with the known mass-metallicity relation. These findings highlight the effectiveness of SOM in analyzing and visualizing complex, multi-dimensional datasets, emphasizing their potential in data-driven astronomical studies.

  Recent models suggest approximately half of all accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}$ $\gtrsim$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$) are expected to undergo intense growth phases behind Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$ $&gt;$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) veils of obscuring gas. However, despite being a viable source for the seeding of SMBHs, there are currently no examples known of a Compton-thick accreting intermediate mass black hole (IMBH; $M_{\rm BH}$ $\sim$ 10$^{2}$ $-$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$). We present a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of IC 750 $-$ the only AGN to-date with a precise megamaser-based intermediate mass $&lt;$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find the equivalent width of neutral 6.4 keV Fe K$\alpha$ to be 1.9$^{+2.2}_{-1.0}$ keV via phenomenological modelling of the co-added 177 ks Chandra spectrum. Such large equivalent widths are seldom produced by processes other than fluorescence from dense obscuration. We fit three physically-motivated X-ray spectral models to infer a range of possible intrinsic 2$-$10 keV luminosity posteriors that encompass the systematic uncertainties associated with a choice of model. Despite a wide range of predicted intrinsic 2$-$10 keV luminosities between $\sim$ 10$^{41}$ and 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, all three models agree that IC 750 has a Compton-thick line-of-sight column density to $&gt;$ 99\% confidence. Compton-thick obscuration is well-documented to impinge substantial bias on the pursuit of SMBH AGN. Our results thus provide the first indication that Compton-thick obscuration should also be properly considered to uncover and understand the IMBH population in an unbiased manner.

  JWST spectroscopy has discovered a population of $z \gtrsim 3.5$ galaxies with broad Balmer emission lines, and narrow forbidden lines, that are consistent with hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). Many of these systems, now known as ``little red dots" (LRDs), are compact and have unique colors that are very red in the optical/near-infrared and blue in the ultraviolet. The relative contribution of galaxy starlight and AGN to these systems remains uncertain, especially for the galaxies with unusual blue+red spectral energy distributions. In this work, we use Balmer decrements to measure the independent dust attenuation of the broad and narrow emission-line components of a sample of 29 broad-line AGN identified from three public JWST spectroscopy surveys: CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES. Stacking the narrow components from the spectra of 25 sources with broad H$\rm{\alpha}$ and no broad H$\rm{\beta}$ results in a median narrow H$\rm{\alpha}$/H$\rm{\beta}$ = $2.47^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ (consistent with $A_{v} = 0$) and broad H$\rm{\alpha}$/H$\rm{\beta}$ $&gt; 8.85$ ($A_{v} &gt; 3.63$). The narrow and broad Balmer decrements imply little-to-no attenuation of the narrow emission lines, which are consistent with being powered by star formation and located on larger physical scales. Meanwhile, the lower limit in broad H$\rm{\alpha}$/H$\rm{\beta}$ decrement, with broad H$\rm{\beta}$ undetected in the stacked spectrum of 25 broad-H$\rm{\alpha}$ AGN, implies significant dust attenuation of the broad-line emitting region that is presumably associated with the central AGN. Our results indicate that these systems, on average, are consistent with heavily dust-attenuated AGN powering the red parts of their SED while their blue UV emission is powered by unattenuated star formation in the host galaxy.

  Hard X-ray-selected samples of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provide one of the cleanest views of supermassive black hole accretion, but are biased against objects obscured by Compton-thick gas column densities of $N_{\rm H}$ $&gt;$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. To tackle this issue, we present the NuSTAR Local AGN $N_{\rm H}$ Distribution Survey (NuLANDS)$-$a legacy sample of 122 nearby ($z$ $&lt;$ 0.044) AGN primarily selected to have warm infrared colors from IRAS between 25$-$60 $\mu$m. We show that optically classified type 1 and 2 AGN in NuLANDS are indistinguishable in terms of optical [OIII] line flux and mid-to-far infrared AGN continuum bolometric indicators, as expected from an isotropically selected AGN sample, while type 2 AGN are deficient in terms of their observed hard X-ray flux. By testing many X-ray spectroscopic models, we show the measured line-of-sight column density varies on average by $\sim$ 1.4 orders of magnitude depending on the obscurer geometry. To circumvent such issues we propagate the uncertainties per source into the parent column density distribution, finding a directly measured Compton-thick fraction of 35 $\pm$ 9%. By construction, our sample will miss sources affected by severe narrow-line reddening, and thus segregates sources dominated by small-scale nuclear obscuration from large-scale host-galaxy obscuration. This bias implies an even higher intrinsic obscured AGN fraction may be possible, although tests for additional biases arising from our infrared selection find no strong effects on the measured column-density distribution. NuLANDS thus holds potential as an optimized sample for future follow-up with current and next-generation instruments aiming to study the local AGN population in an isotropic manner.

  The feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a crucial role in regulating the thermodynamics and the dynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM). Studying the turbulent patterns of the hot and warm ionized phases may allow us to determine how these phases are involved in the AGN cycle and the amount of turbulent pressure generated by the latter. In this work, we use new simulations to study the turbulent motions created by different types of AGN feedback in a cool core cluster and predict the observable signatures with the latest X-ray telescopes (e.g. XRISM). We run several hydrodynamic simulations with ENZO, simulating the self-regulated cycles of AGN feedback, starting from a static ICM in a cluster that represents the Perseus cluster. We study in detail different feedback modes: from pure kinetic precessing jets up to almost pure thermal feedback. Our analysis reveals that the gas velocity dispersion in the center of the cluster correlates in time with the peaks of the AGN activity and that more than 50% of the time, different feedback modalities produce the velocity dispersion observed in the Perseus cluster while leading to distinct geometrical distributions and velocity dispersion profiles. Moreover, we do not find a significant kinematic coupling between the hot and the cold phase kinematics. We find a correlation between the AGN activity and the steepening of the velocity function structure (VSF) and that the projected 2D VSF slopes are never trivially correlated with the 3D VSF ones. This line of research will allow us to use incoming detections of gas turbulent motions detectable by XRISM (or future instruments) to better constrain the duty cycle, energetics and energy dissipation modalities of AGN feedback in massive clusters of galaxies.

  We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of UGC 8782, CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H$_2$ emission. These three nearby AGN hosts are known to present H$_2$ emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H$_2$ S(3)/PAH$_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ line ratio. For every spaxel, we also measure the velocity width ($W_{\rm 80}$) of H$_2$ S(3). We find that the distribution of H$_2$ in the space of these parameters - H$_2$/PAH and its velocity width - is bimodal: one cluster of points shows approximately constant values of $W_{\rm 80}$, while the other cluster exhibits a strong correlation between $W_{\rm 80}$ and H$_2$/PAH. We estimated the temperature of the H$_2$ gas assuming a power-law distribution and find flatter distributions in regions where a correlation between $W_{\rm 80}$ and H$_2$ S(3)/PAH$_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ is observed. Additionally, we observed a correlation between the [Fe II]$_{\rm 5.34 \mu m}$ (a known shock tracer) and the H$_2$ emission. This indicates that the excess H$_2$ emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.

  A recent study on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGN combined unobscured X-ray sources from the eROSITA eFEDS Survey with high quality optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). The HSC data enabled accurate host galaxy subtraction as well as giving a uniform black hole mass estimator from the stellar mass. The resulting stacked optical/X-ray SEDs for black holes at fixed mass show a dramatic transition, where the dominating disc component in bright AGN evaporates into an X-ray hot plasma below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. The models fit to these datasets predicted the largest change in SED in the rest frame UV ($&lt; 3000\,\r{A}$), but this waveband was not included in the original study. Here we use archival $u$-band and UV photometry to extend the SEDs into this range, and confirm the UV is indeed intrinsically faint in AGN below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ as predicted. This dramatic drop in UV photo-ionising flux is also seen from its effect on the broad emission lines. We stack the recently released SDSS DR18 optical spectra for this sample, and show that the broad H$\beta$ line disappears along with the UV bright component at $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. This shows that there is a population of unobscured, X-ray bright, UV faint AGN which lack broad emission lines (true type 2 Seyferts).

  The long-term variability study over a range of black hole (BH) mass systems from the microquasars of stellar-mass black holes to the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) of supermassive black holes, in $\gamma$-rays offers new insights into the physics of relativistic jets. In this work, we investigate the $\gamma$-ray variability of 11 AGNs--including 7 blazars, 2 unclassified blazar candidates (BCUs), 1 radio galaxy (RG), and 1 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) as well as 2 microquasars. We apply a stochastic process known as the Damped Random Walk (DRW) to model the $\sim$15 years of Fermi-LAT light curves. The characteristic timescales observed for AGNs are comparable to those in the accretion disc. Interestingly, the timescales observed in the jet emission of microquasars are similar to those of AGNs, suggesting uniform jet properties across the black hole masses. The observed rest-frame timescales of AGNs overlap with both thermal and non-thermal timescales associated with the jet and accretion disk, respectively, suggesting a scaled relationship between $\tau_{DRW}^{rest}$ and black hole mass ($\rm{M_{BH}}$). While the timescales observed for microquasars deviate significantly from this relationship, nonetheless exhibit a scaled $\tau_{DRW}^{rest}-\rm{M_{BH}}$ relationship using $\gamma$-rays specifically. These findings offer new insights into the origin of jets and the processes driving the emission within them. Additionally, this study hints at a new perspective that the relativistic jets' properties or their production mechanisms may be independent of the black hole mass.

  The influence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on star formation within their host galaxies remains a topic of intense debate. One of the primary challenges in quantifying the star formation rate (SFR) within AGN hosts arises from the prevalent assumption in most methodologies, which attribute gas excitation to young stars alone. However, this assumption does not consider the contribution of the AGN to the ionization of the gas in their environment. To address this issue, we evaluate the use of strong optical emission lines to obtain the SFR surface density ($\Sigma{{\rm SFR_{AGN}}}$) in regions predominantly ionized by an AGN, using a sample of 293 AGN hosts from the MaNGA survey, with SFR measurements available through stellar population fitting. We propose calibrations involving the H$\alpha$ and [O\,{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007 emission lines, which can be used to determine $\Sigma{{\rm SFR_{AGN}}}$, resulting in values consistent with those estimated through stellar population fitting.

  JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at $z\approx5-8$ dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at $z=7.04$ from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being sub-dominant at all wavelength and contributing at $\sim20\%$ level. However, our most credible model infers a stellar mass of $M_\star\approx 4\times10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ within a radius of $r_\mathrm{e}&lt;30\,$pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO-1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.

  For radio transients, an inverted spectrum (defined as $\alpha &gt; 0$ for a power law spectrum $S_{\nu}\propto \nu^{\alpha}$) constrains physical properties, which in principle can be a useful criterion for selecting specific targets of interest in a transient search. To test and develop this concept, we have searched epoch 1 of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS; 3.0 GHz) and the VLITE Commensal Sky Survey (VCSS; 340 MHz) for radio transients with inverted spectra. We discover a sample of 22 inverted-spectra transient candidates that are not associated with cataloged active galactic nuclei (AGNs). To the best of our knowledge, none of our candidates have transient counterparts at other wavelengths, and only one has previously been reported as a radio transient. We find that our candidates evolve slowly over years and show either highly inverted spectra or peaked spectra over $\sim$1--3 GHz. Within our sample, nine candidates are matched to optical centers of galaxies and have estimated radio spectral luminosities of $L_{3.0\mathrm{GHz}}\sim10^{30}-10^{33}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$. Based on the observed properties, we find the most plausible transient classification for our candidates to be relativistic tidal disruption events. However, we are unable to fully rule out variable or transient AGNs with highly inverted spectra. Upon examining physical constraints, we confirm that mainly relativistic transients (on-axis or off-axis) with equipartition energy $E_{\mathrm{eq}}\gtrsim10^{49}-10^{53}\,\mathrm{erg}$ are expected from searching VLASS and VCSS based on inverted spectra. The obtainable physical constraints, however, can be weak due to degeneracy introduced by viewing angle.

  The outshining light from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) poses significant challenges in studying the properties of AGN host galaxies. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach which combines image decomposition and spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition to constrain properties of AGN host galaxies. Image decomposition allows us to disentangle optical flux into AGN and stellar components, thereby providing additional constraints on the SED models to derive more refined stellar mass. To test the viability of this approach, we obtained a sample of 24 X-ray selected type-I AGNs with redshifts ranging from 0.73 to 2.47. We estimated the stellar masses for our sample and found that our results are generally consistent with earlier estimates based on different methods. Through examining the posterior distribution of stellar masses, we find that our method could derive better constrained results compared to previous SED decomposition methods. With the derived stellar masses, we further studied the $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ relation of our sample, finding a higher intrinsic scatter in the correlation for our entire sample compared to the local quiescent correlation, which could be caused by a few black hole monsters in our sample. We propose that based on our method, future works could extend to larger samples of high-redshift AGN host galaxies, thereby enhancing our understanding of their properties.

  We study the effects of AGN feedback on the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1D flux power spectrum (P1D). Using the Simba cosmological-hydrodynamic simulations, we examine the impact that adding different AGN feedback modes has on the predicted P1D. We find that, for Simba, the impact of AGN feedback is most dramatic at lower redshifts ($z&lt;1$) and that AGN jet feedback plays the most significant role in altering the P1D. The effects of AGN feedback can be seen across a large range of wavenumbers ($1.5\times10^{-3}&lt;k&lt;10^{-1}$ s/km) changing the ionization state of hydrogen in the IGM through heating. AGN feedback can also alter the thermal evolution of the IGM and thermally broaden individual Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers. For the Simba model, these effects become observable at $z \lesssim 1.0$. At higher redshifts ($z&gt;2.0$), AGN feedback has a $2\%$ effect on the P1D for $k&lt;5\times10^{-2}$ s/km and an $8\%$ effect for $k&gt;5\times10^{-2}$ s/km. We show that the small scale effect is reduced when normalizing the simulation to the observed mean flux. On large scales, the effect of AGN feedback appears via a change in the IGM temperature and is thus unlikely to bias cosmological parameters. The strong AGN jets in the Simba simulation can reproduce the $z&gt;2$ Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We stress that analyses comparing different AGN feedback models to future higher precision data will be necessary to determine the full extent of this effect.

  The stellar mass-star formation rate (M$_\star$ - SFR) plane is essential for distinguishing galaxy populations, but how galaxies move within this plane over cosmic time remains unclear. This study aims to describe galaxy migrations in the M$_\star$ - SFR plane by reconstructing star formation histories (SFHs) for a sample of galaxies out to redshift $z &lt; 4$. This provides insights into the physical processes driving star formation. We use data from the COSMOS field, selecting 299131 galaxies at $z &lt; 4$ with COSMOS-Web NIRCam data (m$_\mathrm{F444W} &lt; 27$) over 0.54 deg$^2$. Using the SED modeling code CIGALE with non-parametric SFHs, we derive physical properties and migration vectors for these galaxies. These vectors describe the direction and velocity of evolutionary paths across the M$_\star$ - SFR plane. To assess the accuracy of these vectors, we compare them to results from the Horizon-AGN simulation. Galaxies within the main sequence show low migration amplitudes and dispersed movement directions, indicating oscillation within the main sequence. Most progenitors were already on the main sequence a billion years earlier. Starburst galaxies assembled half their mass in the last 350 Myr and originated from the main sequence. Passive galaxies show uniformly declining SFHs and include massive galaxies already in the passive region at $z = 3.5-4$, with increasing density over time. Using reconstructed SFHs up to $z &lt; 4$, we propose a coherent picture of how galaxies migrate over cosmic time in the M$_\star$ - SFR plane, highlighting the connection between major phases in the star-formation history.

  Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a critical role in shaping the matter distribution on scales comparable to and larger than individual galaxies. Upcoming surveys such as $\textit{Euclid}$ and LSST aim to precisely quantify the matter distribution on cosmological scales, making a detailed understanding of AGN feedback effects essential. Hydrodynamical simulations provide an informative framework for studying these effects, in particular by allowing us to vary the parameters that determine the strength of these feedback processes and, consequently, to predict their corresponding impact on the large-scale matter distribution. We use the EAGLE simulations to explore how changes in subgrid viscosity and AGN heating temperature affect the matter distribution, quantified via 2- and 3-point correlation functions, as well as higher order cumulants of the matter distribution. We find that varying viscosity has a small impact ($\approx 10\%$) on scales larger than $1 h^{-1}$ Mpc, while changes to the AGN heating temperature lead to substantial differences, with up to $70\%$ variation in gas clustering on small scales ($\lesssim 1 h^{-1}$ Mpc). By examining the suppression of the power spectrum as a function of time, we identify the redshift range $z = 1.5 - 1$ as a key epoch where AGN feedback begins to dominate in these simulations. The 3-point function provides complementary insight to the more familiar 2-point statistics, and shows more pronounced variations between models on the scale of individual haloes. On the other hand, we find that effects on even larger scales are largely comparable.

  Dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) offer a unique opportunity to probe the relationship between super massive black holes (SMBH) and their host galaxies as well as the role of major mergers in triggering AGN activity. The confirmed dual AGN Mrk 266 has been studied extensively with multi-wavelength imaging. Now, high spatial resolution IFU spectroscopy of Mrk 266 provides an opportunity to probe the kinematics of both the merger event and AGN feedback. We present for the first time high spatial resolution kinematic maps for both nuclei of Mrk 266 obtained with the Keck OSIRIS IFU spectrograph, utilizing adaptive optics to achieve a resolution of 0.31" and 0.20" for the NE and SW nuclei, respectively. Using the M-sigma relation for mergers, we infer a SMBH mass of approximately 7e7 solar masses for the southwestern nucleus. Additionally, we report that the molecular gas kinematics of the southwestern nucleus are dominated by rotation rather than large-scale chaotic motions. The southwest nucleus also contains both a circumnuclear ring of star formation from which an inflow of molecular gas is likely fueling the AGN and a compact, AGN-dominated outflow of highly ionized gas with a timescale of approximately 2 Myr, significantly shorter than the timescale of the merger. The northeastern nucleus, on the other hand, exhibits complex kinematics related to the merger, including molecular gas that appears to have decoupled from the rotation of the stars. Our results suggest that while the AGN activity in Mrk 266 was likely triggered during the merger, AGN feeding is currently the result of processes internal to each host galaxy, thus resulting in a strong asymmetry between the two nuclei.
