  1ES1927+654 is a nearby active galactic nucleus that has shown an enigmatic outburst in optical/UV followed by X-rays, exhibiting strange variability patterns at timescales of months-years. Here we report the unusual X-ray, UV, and radio variability of the source in its post-flare state (Jan 2022- May 2023). Firstly, we detect an increase in the soft X-ray (0.3-2 keV) flux from May 2022- May 2023 by almost a factor of five, which we call the bright-soft-state. The hard X-ray 2-10 keV flux increased by a factor of two, while the UV flux density did not show any significant changes ($\le 30\%$) in the same period. The integrated energy pumped into the soft and hard X-ray during this period of eleven months is $\sim 3.57\times 10^{50}$ erg and $5.9\times 10^{49}$ erg, respectively. From the energetics, it is evident that whatever is producing the soft excess (SE) is pumping out more energy than either the UV or hard X-ray source. Since the energy source presumably is ultimately the accretion of matter onto the SMBH, the SE emitting region must be receiving the majority of this energy. In addition, the source does not follow the typical disc-corona relation found in AGNs, neither in the initial flare (in 2017-2019) nor in the current bright soft state (2022-2023). We found that the core (&lt;1 pc) radio emission at 5 GHz gradually increased till March 2022 but showed a dip in August 2022. The G\"udel Benz relation ($L_{\rm radio}/L_{\rm X-ray}\sim 10^{-5}$), however, is still within the expected range for radio-quiet AGN and further follow-up radio observations are currently being undertaken.

  The highly variable blazar OJ~287 is commonly discussed as an example of a binary black hole system. The 130 year long optical light curve is well explained by a model where the central body is a massive black hole of 18.35$\times$10$^9$ solar mass that supports a thin accretion disc. The secondary black hole of 0.15$\times$10$^9$ solar mass impacts the disc twice during its 12 year orbit, and causes observable flares. Recently, it has been argued that an accretion disc with a typical AGN accretion rate and above mentioned central body mass should be at least six magnitudes brighter than OJ~287's host galaxy and would therefore be observationally excluded. Based on the observations of OJ~287's radio jet, detailed in Marscher and Jorstad (2011), and up-to-date accretion disc models of Azadi et al. (2022), we show that the V-band magnitude of the accretion disc is unlikely to exceed the host galaxy brightness by more than one magnitude, and could well be fainter than the host. This is because accretion power is necessary to launch the jet as well as to create electromagnetic radiation, distributed across many wavelengths, and not concentrated especially on the optical V-band. Further, we note that the claimed V-band concentration of accretion power leads to serious problems while interpreting observations of other Active Galactic Nuclei. Therefore, we infer that the mass of the primary black hole and its accretion rate do not need to be smaller than what is determined in the standard model for OJ~287.

  We present 12 new AGN at 4&lt;z&lt;7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z=10.6) revealed through the detection of a Broad Line Region as seen in the Balmer emission lines. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases we find evidence for two broad components of Halpha which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs). The inferred BH masses range between 8 x 10^7 Msun down to 4 x 10^5 Msun, interestingly probing the regime expected for Direct Collapse Black Holes. The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities (~10^44-10^45 erg/s) imply accretion rates that are &lt; 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BH, with M_BH ~ 10^6 Msun, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BH at z~4-11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies stellar masses when compared to the local M_BH-Mstar relation. However, we find that these early BH tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M_BH and velocity dispersion, as well as between M_BH and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the BPT excitation-diagnostic diagram these AGN are located in the region that is that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what expected for AGN hosted in metal poor galaxies (Z ~ 0.1-0.2 Zsun). The fraction of broad line AGN with L_AGN &gt; 10^44 erg/s, among galaxies in the redshift range 4&lt;z&lt;6, is about 10%, suggesting that the contribution of AGN and their hosts to the reionization of the Universe is &gt; 10%.
