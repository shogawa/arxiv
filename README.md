  We describe the design of a radio interferometer composed of a GlobalNavigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) antenna and a Very Long BaselineInterferometry (VLBI) radio telescope. Our eventual goal is to use thisinterferometer for geodetic applications including local tie measurements. TheGNSS element of the interferometer uses a unique software-defined receivingsystem and modified commercial geodetic-quality GNSS antenna. We ran threeobserving sessions in 2022 between a 25 m radio telescope in Fort Davis, Texas(FD-VLBA), a transportable GNSS antenna placed within 100 meters, and a GNSSantenna placed at a distance of about 9 km. We have detected a stronginterferometric response with a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of over 1000 fromGlobal Positioning System (GPS) and Galileo satellites. We also observednatural radio sources including Galactic supernova remnants and Active GalacticNuclei (AGN) located as far as one gigaparsec, thus extending the range ofsources that can be referenced to a GNSS antenna by 18 orders of magnitude.These detections represent the first observations made with a GNSS antenna toradio telescope interferometer. We have developed a novel technique based on aPrecise Point Positioning (PPP) solution of the recorded GNSS signal thatallows us to extend integration time at 1.5 GHz to at least 20 minutes withoutany noticeable SNR degradation when a rubidium frequency standard is used.

  The circumnuclear material around Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is one of theessential components of the obscuration-based unification model. However, ourunderstanding of the circumnuclear material in terms of its geometrical shape,structure and its dependence on accretion rate is still debated. In this paper,we present the multi-epoch broadband X-ray spectral modelling of a nearbyCompton-thick AGN in Circinus galaxy. We utilise all the available hard X-ray($&gt; 10$ keV) observations taken from different telescopes, $i.e.,$ $BeppoSAX$,$Suzaku$, $NuSTAR$ and $AstroSat$, at ten different epochs across $22$ yearsfrom $1998$ to $2020$. The $3.0-79$ keV broadband X-ray spectral modellingusing physically-motivated models, namely MYTORUS, BORUS02 and UXCLUMPY, infersthe presence of a torus with a low covering factor of $0.28$, an inclinationangle of $77^{\circ}$ $-$ $81^{\circ}$ and Compton-thick line-of-sight columndensities ($N_{\rm H,LOS} = 4.13~-~9.26~\times~10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) in all theepochs. The joint multi-epoch spectral modelling suggests that the overallstructure of the torus is likely to remain unchanged. However, we findtentative evidence for the variable line-of-sight column density on timescalesranging from one day to one week to a few years, suggesting a clumpycircumnuclear material located at sub-parsec to tens of parsec scales.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been proposed as plausible sites hosting asizable fraction of the binary black hole (BBH) mergers measured throughgravitational waves (GWs) by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) experiment. These GWscould be accompanied by radiation feedback due to the interaction of the BBHmerger remnant with the AGN disc. We present a new predicted radiationsignature driven by the passage of a kicked BBH remnant throughout a thin AGNdisc. We analyse the situation of a merger occurring outside the thin disc,where the merger is of second or higher generation in a merging hierarchicalsequence. The coalescence produces a kicked BH remnant that eventually plungesinto the disc, accretes material, and inflates jet cocoons. We consider thecase of a jet cocoon propagating quasi-parallel to the disc plane and study theoutflow that results when the cocoon emerges from the disc. Here we focus onthe long time-scale emission produced after the disc outflow expands andbecomes optically thin. The bolometric luminosity of such disc outflow evolvesas $L\propto t^{-7/2}$. Depending on the parameter configuration, the flareproduced by the disc outflow could be comparable to or exceed the AGNbackground emission at near-infrared, optical, and extreme ultravioletwavelengths appearing $\sim$[20-500] days after the GW event and lasting for$\sim$[1-200] days, accordingly.

  Models of active galactic nuclei (AGN) suggest that their circumnuclear mediaare complex with clumps and filaments, while recent observations hint towardspolar extended structures of gas and dust, as opposed to the classical torusparadigm. The X-ray band forms an interesting window to study thesecircumnuclear media in great detail. In this work, we extended the radiativetransfer code SKIRT with the X-ray processes that govern the broadband X-rayspectra of obscured AGN, to study the structure of AGN circumnuclear media infull 3D, based on their reflected X-ray emission. We extended the SKIRT codewith Compton scattering on free electrons, photo-absorption and fluorescence bycold atomic gas, scattering on bound electrons, and extinction by dust. Thisincludes a novel treatment of extreme-forward scattering by dust, and adetailed description of anomalous Rayleigh scattering. To verify our X-rayimplementation, we performed the first dedicated benchmark of X-ray torusmodels, comparing five X-ray radiative transfer codes. Finally, we illustratedthe 3D nature of the code by producing synthetic X-ray images and spectra ofclumpy torus models. SKIRT forms a powerful new tool to model AGN circumnuclearmedia in full 3D from X-ray to millimetre wavelengths, and is now publiclyavailable. In the X-ray regime, we find an excellent agreement with thesimulation results of the MYTorus and RefleX codes, which validates our X-rayimplementation. We find some discrepancies with other codes, which motivatesthe need for a robust framework that can handle non-linear 3D radiativetransfer effects. The new X-ray functionalities of the SKIRT code allow foruncomplicated access to a broad suite of 3D X-ray models for AGN that caneasily be tested and modified. This will be particularly useful with the adventof X-ray microcalorimeter observations.

  Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio sources are active galactic nuclei thathave radio jets propagating only on galactic scales, defined as havingprojected linear sizes (LS) of up to $20\,$kpc. CSS sources are generallyhosted by massive early-type galaxies with little on-going star formation,however a small fraction are known to have enhanced star formation. Usingarchival data from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey, theVery Large Array Sky Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we identify avolume-limited sample of $166$ CSS sources at $z&lt;0.2$ with$L_{1.4\,\text{GHz}}&gt;10^{24}\,\text{W}\,\text{Hz}^{-1}$. Comparing the starformation rates and linear sizes of these CSS sources, we find that the$\approx14\,\%$ of CSS sources with specific star formation rates above$0.01\,\text{Gyr}^{-1}$ all have $\text{LS}&lt;10\,$kpc. We discuss the possiblemechanisms driving this result, concluding that it is likely the excess starformation in these sources occurred in multiple bursts and ceased prior to theAGN jet being triggered.

  The role of AGN in quenching galaxies and driving the evolution fromstar-forming to quiescent remains a key question in galaxy evolution. Wepresent evidence from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey forfading AGN activity in 6/93 post-starburst galaxies. These six galaxies showextended emission line regions (EELRs) consistent with ionization from past AGNactivity, analogous to "Hanny's voorwerp" and other systems where the OIII5007emission is bright enough to be visible in broadband imaging. Using theinfrared luminosities from IRAS to estimate the current AGN luminosity, we findthat 5/6 of the post-starburst galaxies have current AGN which have faded fromthe peak luminosity required to have ionized the EELRs. Given the rate at whichwe observe EELRs, the typical EELR visibility timescale, and an estimate of howoften EELRs would be visible, we estimate the duty cycle of AGN activity duringthe post-starburst phase. The timescale for the galaxy to cycle between peaksin AGN luminosity is $t_{\rm EELR}\sim1.1-2.3\times10^5$ yr. Given the rate atwhich we observe current AGN activity during this phase, we estimate that theAGN spends only 5.3% of this time (or $t_{\rm ON} = 0.6-1.3\times10^4$ yr) inits luminous phase, with the rest of the time spent "off" or in alow-luminosity phase. The length of this duty cycle may explain why so fewluminous AGN have been observed during the post-starburst phase, despiteevidence for AGN feedback at work.

  X-ray binaries are known to show state transitions related to accretion ratechanges which are often accompanied with dramatic changes in the jet emission.However, it is not clear whether this characteristics of stellar-mass blackhole systems can be scaled up to the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei.The Seyfert 1 galaxy, KUG 1141+371 has been showing a steadily increasing X-rayflux since 2007, and exhibited variability behaviour similar to the statetransitions observed in X-ray binaries. It was hypothesised to undergo a rapidboost of mass accretion. If the X-ray binary analogy holds then the appearanceof jet emission can also be expected in KUG 1141+371. While the source was notdetected in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters in 1994, itappears in the VLA Sky Survey in 2019 and at 22 GHz in a VLA observation in2018 at mJy flux density level. Our VLBI observations revealed a compact,flat-spectrum radio feature. Its high brightness temperature indicates theradio emission originates from an AGN.

  Triple AGN systems are expected to be the result of the hierarchical model ofgalaxy formation. Since there are very few of them confirmed as such, wepresent the results of a new study of the triple-AGN candidate SDSSJ102700.40+174900.8 (center nucleus) through observations with$\it{GTC}$-$\it{MEGARA}$ Integral Field Unit. 1D and 2D analysis of the lineratios of the three nuclei allow us to locate them in the EW(H$\alpha$) vs.[Nii] /H$\alpha$ diagram. The central nucleus is found to be a retired galaxy(or fake AGN). The neighbors are found to be a strong AGN (southeasternnucleus, J102700.55+174900.2) compatible with a Sy2 galaxy, and a weak AGN(northern nucleus, J102700.38+174902.6) compatible with a LINER2. We findevidence that the neighbors constitute a dual AGN system (Sy2-LINER2) with aprojected separation of 3.98 kpc in the optical bands. The H$\alpha$ velocitymap shows that the northern nucleus has an H$\alpha$ emission with a velocityoffset of $\sim$-500 km s$^{-1}$, whereas the southeastern nucleus has arotating disk and H$\alpha$ extended emission at kpc scales. Chandra archivaldata confirm that the neighbors have X-ray (0.5-2) keV and (2-7) keV emission,whereas the center nucleus shows no X-ray emission. A collisional ring withknots is observed in the HST images of the southeastern nucleus. These knotscoincide with star formation regions that along with the ring are predicted ina head-on collision. In this case, the morphology changes are probably due to aminor merger that was produced by the passing of the northern through thesoutheastern nucleus.

  Active dwarf galaxies are important because they contribute to the evolutionof dwarf galaxies and can reveal their hosted massive black holes. However, thesample size of such sources beyond the local universe is still highly limited.In this work, we search for active dwarf galaxies in the recently completedXMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS). XMM-SERVSis currently the largest medium-depth X-ray survey covering 13 $\mathrm{deg}^2$in three extragalactic fields, which all have well-characterizedmulti-wavelength information. After considering several factors that may leadto misidentifications, we identify 73 active dwarf galaxies at $z&lt;1$, whichconstitutes the currently largest X-ray-selected sample beyond the localuniverse. Our sources are generally less obscured than predictions based on themassive-AGN (active galactic nucleus) X-ray luminosity function and have a lowradio-excess fraction. We find that our sources reside in similar environmentsto inactive dwarf galaxies. We further quantify the accretion distribution ofthe dwarf-galaxy population after considering various selection effects andfind that it decreases with X-ray luminosity, but redshift evolution cannot bestatistically confirmed. Depending upon how we define an AGN, the activefraction may or may not show a strong dependence on stellar mass. TheirEddington ratios and X-ray bolometric corrections significantly deviate fromthe expected relation, which is likely caused by several large underlyingsystematic biases when estimating the relevant parameters for dwarf galaxies.Throughout this work, we also highlight problems in reliably measuringphotometric redshifts and overcoming strong selection effects for distantactive dwarf galaxies.

  We present results from the first 22 GHz space very-long-baselineinterferometric (VLBI) imaging observations of M87 by RadioAstron. As a part ofthe Nearby AGN Key Science Program, the source was observed in Feb 2014 at 22GHz with 21 ground stations, reaching projected $(u,v)$-spacings up to$\sim11\,$G$\lambda$. The imaging experiment was complemented by snapshotRadioAstron data of M87 obtained during 2013--2016 from the AGN Survey KeyScience Program. Their longest baselines extend up to $\sim25\,$G$\lambda$. Forall these measurements, fringes are detected only up to $\sim$2.8 EarthDiameter or $\sim$3 G$\lambda$ baseline lengths, resulting in a new image withangular resolution of $\sim150\,\mu$as or $\sim20$ Schwarzschild radii spatialresolution. The new image not only shows edge-brightened jet and counterjetstructures down to submilliarcsecond scales but also clearly resolves the VLBIcore region. While the overall size of the core is comparable to those reportedin the literature, the ground-space fringe detection and slightlysuper-resolved RadioAstron image suggest the presence of substructures in thenucleus, whose minimum brightness temperature exceeds $T_{\rm B,min}\sim10^{12}\,$K. It is challenging to explain the origin of thisrecord-high $T_{\rm B, min}$ value for M87 by pure Doppler boosting effect witha simple conical jet geometry and known jet speed. Therefore, this can beevidence for more extreme Doppler boosting due to a blazar-like small jetviewing angle or highly efficient particle acceleration processes occurringalready at the base of the outflow.
