  We investigate the driving mechanisms for the HI gas content in star-forming central galaxies at low redshift, by examining the HI-to-stelalr mass ratio ($M_{\rm HI}/M_\ast$) in both the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, IllustrisTNG (TNG) and EAGLE, and the xGASS sample. We quantify the correlations of $M_{\rm HI}/M_\ast$ with a variety of galaxy properties using the random forest regression technique, and we make comparisons between the two simulations, as well as between the simulations and xGASS. Gas-phase metallicity is found to be most important in both simulations, but is ranked mildly for xGASS, suggesting that metals and gas driven by feedback effects in real galaxies is not as tightly coupled as in the simulations. Beyond that, the accretion rate of supermassive black holes is the most important feature in TNG, while specific star formation rate is the top ranked in EAGLE. This result can be understood from the fact that the HI gas is regulated mainly by thermal-mode AGN feedback in TNG and by stellar feedback in EAGLE. Although neither simulation can fully reproduce the feature importance obtained for real galaxies in the xGASS, EAGLE performs better than TNG in the sense that the observationally top-ranked property, $u-r$, is also highly ranked in EAGLE. This result implies that stellar feedback plays a more dominant role than AGN feedback in driving the HI gas content of low-redshift galaxies.

  We investigated the influence of the Eddington ratio on sub-parsec-scale outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) masses of $10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ using two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. When the range of Eddington ratio, $\gamma_{\rm Edd} &gt; 10^{-3}$, the radiation force exceeds the gas pressure, leading to stronger outflows and larger dust sublimation radius. Although the sub-parsec-scale outflows is a time-dependence phenomena, our simulations demonstrated that the radial distributions can be well explained by the steady solutions of the spherically symmetric stellar winds. The dynamic structure of sub-parsec-scale outflows is influenced by the dust sublimation radius and the critical radii determined by the dynamical equilibrium condition. Although significantly affecting the outflow velocity, the Eddington ratio exerts minimal effects on temperature and number density distribution. Furthermore, our analytical solutions highlight the importance of the dust sublimation scale as a crucial determinant of terminal velocity and column density in dusty outflows. Through comparisons of our numerical model with the obscuring fraction observed in nearby AGNs, we revealed insights into the Eddington ratio dependence and the tendency towards the large obscuring fraction of the dusty and dust-free gases. The analytical solutions are expected to facilitate an understanding of the dynamical structure and radiation structures along the line of sight and their viewing angles from observations of ionized outflows.

  A stellar-mass black hole, embedded within the accretion disk of an active galactic nuclei (AGN), has the potential to accrete gas at a rate that can reach approximately $\sim 10^9$ times the Eddington limit. This study explores the potential for nuclear burning in the rapidly accreting flow towards this black hole and studies how nucleosynthesis affects metal production. Using numerical methods, we have obtained the disk structure while considering nuclear burning and assessed the stability of the disk. In contrast to gas accretion onto the surface of a neutron star or white dwarf, the disk remains stable against the thermal and secular instabilities because advection cooling offsets the nuclear heating effects. The absence of a solid surface for a black hole prevents excessive mass accumulation in the inner disk region. Notably, nuclear fusion predominantly takes place in the inner disk region, resulting in substantial burning of $\rm ^{12}C$ and $\rm ^{3}He$, particularly for black holes around $M = 10\, M_\odot$ with accretion rates exceeding approximately $\sim 10^7$ times the Eddington rate. The ejection of carbon-depleted gas through outflows can lead to an increase in the mass ratio of oxygen or nitrogen to carbon, which may be reflected in observed line ratios such as $\rm N\, V/C\, IV$ and $\rm O\, IV/C\, IV$. Consequently, these elevated spectral line ratios could be interpreted as indications of super-solar metallicity in the broad line region.

  Computing photo-z for AGN is challenging, primarily due to the interplay of relative emissions associated with the SMBH and its host galaxy. SED fitting methods, effective in pencil-beam surveys, face limitations in all-sky surveys with fewer bands available, lacking the ability to capture the AGN contribution to the SED accurately. This limitation affects the many 10s of millions of AGN clearly singled out and identified by SRG/eROSITA. Our goal is to significantly enhance photometric redshift performance for AGN in all-sky surveys while avoiding the need to merge multiple data sets. Instead, we employ readily available data products from the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey for DESI, covering &gt; 20,000 deg$^{2}$ with deep images and catalog-based photometry in the grizW1-W4 bands. We introduce PICZL, a machine-learning algorithm leveraging an ensemble of CNNs. Utilizing a cross-channel approach, the algorithm integrates distinct SED features from images with those obtained from catalog-level data. Full probability distributions are achieved via the integration of Gaussian mixture models. On a validation sample of 8098 AGN, PICZL achieves a variance $\sigma_{\textrm{NMAD}}$ of 4.5% with an outlier fraction $\eta$ of 5.6%, outperforming previous attempts to compute accurate photo-z for AGN using ML. We highlight that the model's performance depends on many variables, predominantly the depth of the data. A thorough evaluation of these dependencies is presented in the paper. Our streamlined methodology maintains consistent performance across the entire survey area when accounting for differing data quality. The same approach can be adopted for future deep photometric surveys such as LSST and Euclid, showcasing its potential for wide-scale realisation. With this paper, we release updated photo-z (including errors) for the XMM-SERVS W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1 and LSS fields.
