  We present rest-frame optical data of the z~4 sub-millimeter galaxy GN20 obtained with JWST/NIRSpec in integral field spectroscopy (IFS) mode. The H$\alpha$ emission is asymmetric and clumpy and extends over a projected distance of more than 15 kpc. To first order, the large-scale ionised gas kinematics are consistent with a turbulent ($\sigma\sim90$ km/s), rotating disc ($v_{\rm rot}\sim500$ km/s), congruent with previous studies of its molecular and ionised gas kinematics. However, we also find clear evidence for non-circular motions in the H$\alpha$ kinematics. We discuss their possible connection with various scenarios, such as external perturbations, accretion or radial flows. In the centre of GN20, we find broad line emission (FWHM $\sim1000-2000$ km/s) in the H$\alpha$+[N II] complex, suggestive of fast, AGN-driven winds or, alternatively, of the broad-line region of an active black hole. Elevated values of [N II]$\lambda6583$/H$\alpha&gt;0.4$ and EW(H$\alpha)&gt;6$ \r{A}, throughout large parts of GN20 suggest that feedback from the active black hole is able to photo-ionise the interstellar medium. Our data corroborates that GN20 offers a unique opportunity to observe key processes in the evolution of the most massive present-day galaxies acting in concert, over 12 billion years ago.

  The infrared (IR) range is extremely useful in the context of chemical abundance studies of the gas-phase interstellar medium (ISM) due to the large variety of ionic species traced in this regime, the negligible effects from dust attenuation or temperature stratification, and the amount of data that has been and will be released in the coming years. Taking advantage of available IR emission lines, we analysed the chemical content of the gas-phase ISM in a sample of 131 Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGs) and 73 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Particularly, we derived the chemical content via their total oxygen abundance in combination with nitrogen and sulfur abundances, and with the ionisation parameter. We used a new version of the code HII-CHI-Mistry-IR v3.1 which allows us to estimate log(N/O), 12+log(O/H), log(U), and, for the first time, 12+log(S/H) from IR emission lines, which can be applied to both SFGs and AGNs. We tested that the estimations from this new version, that only considers sulfur lines for the derivation of sulfur abundances, are compatible with previous studies. While most of the SFGs and AGNs show solar log(N/O) abundances, we found a large spread in the log(S/O) relative abundances. Specifically, we found extremely low log(S/O) values (1/10th solar) in some SFGs and AGNs with solar-like oxygen abundances. This result warns against the use of optical and IR sulfur emission lines to estimate oxygen abundances when no prior estimation of log(S/O) is provided.

  Multi-wavelength observations indicate that the intracluster medium in some galaxy clusters contains cold filaments, while their formation mechanism remains debated. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show that cold filaments could naturally condense out of hot gaseous wake flows uplifted by the jet-inflated active galactic nucleus (AGN) bubbles. Consistent with observations, the simulated filaments extend to tens of kpc from the cluster center, with a representative mass of $\rm 10^{8}- 10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ for a typical AGN outburst energy of $10^{60}~ \rm erg$. They show smooth velocity gradients, stretching typically from inner inflows to outer outflows with velocity dispersions of several hundred $\rm km\ s^{-1}$. The properties of cold filaments are affected substantially by jet properties. Compared to kinetic energy-dominated jets, thermal energy-dominated jets tend to produce longer cold filaments with higher masses. With the same jet energy, AGN jets with an earlier turn-on time, a lower jet base, or a higher power heat the cluster center more effectively, and produce shorter filaments at a much later epoch.

  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous millisecond-duration radio pulses with extragalactic origin, which were discovered more than a decade ago. Despite the numerous samples, the physical origin of FRBs remains poorly understood. FRBs have been thought to originate from young magnetars or accreting compact objects (COs). Massive stars or COs are predicted to be embedded in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The dense disk absorbs FRBs severely, making them difficult to observe. However, progenitors ejecta or outflow feedback from the accreting COs interact with the disk material to form a cavity. The existence of the cavity can reduce the absorption by the dense disk materials, making FRBs escape. Here we investigate the production and propagation of FRBs in AGN disks and find that the AGN environments lead to the following unique observational properties, which can be verified in future observation. First, the dense material in the disk can cause large dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM). Second, the toroidal magnetic field in the AGN disk can cause Faraday conversion. Third, during the shock breakout, DM and RM show non-power-law evolution patterns over time. Fourth, for accreting-powered models, higher accretion rates lead to more bright bursts in AGN disks.

  This paper presents a study of the impact of supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback on dark matter (DM) halos in numerical NIHAO simulations of galaxies. In particular, the amount of DM displaced via active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and the physical scale over which AGN feedback affects the DM halo are quantified by comparing NIHAO simulations with and without AGN feedback. NIHAO galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_{\rm \odot})\geq 10.0$ show a growing central DM suppression of 0.2 dex (~40%) from z = 1.5 to the present relative to noAGN feedback simulations. The growth of the DM suppression is related to the mass evolution of the SMBH and the gas mass in the central regions. For the most massive NIHAO galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_{\rm \odot}) &gt; 10.5$, partially affected by numerical resolution, the central DM suppression peaks at z = 0.5, after which halo contraction overpowers AGN feedback due a shortage of gas and, thus, SMBH growth. The spatial scale, or ``sphere of influence,'' over which AGN feedback affects the DM distribution decreases as a function of time for MW-mass galaxies (from ~16 kpc at z = 1.5 to ~7.8 kpc at z = 0) as a result of halo contraction due to stellar growth. For the most massive NIHAO galaxies, the size of the sphere of influence remains constant (~16 kpc) for z &gt; 0.5 owing to the balance between AGN feedback and halo contraction.

  Most diffuse baryons, including the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the cosmic web, remain unmeasured and unconstrained. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) offer an unparalleled method to measure the electron dispersion measures (DMs) of ionized baryons. Their distribution can resolve the missing baryon problem, and constrain the history of feedback theorized to impart significant energy to the CGM and IGM. We analyze the Cosmology and Astrophysics in Machine Learning (CAMEL) Simulations, using three suites: IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid, each varying 6 parameters (2 cosmological &amp; 4 astrophysical feedback), for a total of 183 distinct simulation models. We find significantly different predictions between the fiducial models of the suites, owing to their different implementations of feedback. SIMBA exhibits the strongest feedback, leading to the smoothest distribution of baryons, reducing the sightline-to-sightline variance in DMs between z=0-1. Astrid has the weakest feedback and the largest variance. We calculate FRB CGM measurements as a function of galaxy impact parameter, with SIMBA showing the weakest DMs due to aggressive AGN feedback and Astrid the strongest. Within each suite, the largest differences are due to varying AGN feedback. IllustrisTNG shows the most sensitivity to supernova feedback, but this is due to the change in the AGN feedback strengths, demonstrating that black holes, not stars, are most capable of redistributing baryons in the IGM and CGM. We compare our statistics directly to recent observations, paving the way for the use of FRBs to constrain the physics of galaxy formation and evolution.

  The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD ($z=3.1$) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM $\sim4000$km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 $\mu$m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a $M_*\sim 10^9M_\odot$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires $A_{\rm v}\gtrsim4$, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H$\alpha$ EW $\sim800$\AA). The widths and luminosities of Pa$\beta$, Pa$\delta$, Pa$\gamma$, and H$\alpha$ imply a modest black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^8M_\odot$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to $\sim1$\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

  We used the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite to measure, for the first time, the 2-8 keV polarization of NGC 1068. We pointed IXPE for a net exposure time of 1.15 Ms on the target, in addition to two ~ 10 ks each Chandra snapshots in order to account for the potential impact of several ultraluminous X-ray source (ULXs) within IXPE's field-of-view. We measured a 2 - 8 keV polarization degree of 12.4% +/- 3.6% and an electric vector polarization angle of 101{\deg} +/- 8{\deg} at 68% confidence level. If we exclude the spectral region containing the bright Fe K lines and other soft X-ray lines where depolarization occurs, the polarization fraction rises up to 21.3% +/- 6.7% in the 3.5 - 6.0 keV band, with a similar polarization angle. The observed polarization angle is found to be perpendicular to the parsec scale radio jet. Using a combined Chandra and IXPE analysis plus multi-wavelength constraints, we estimated that the circumnuclear "torus" may sustain a half-opening angle of 50{\deg} - 55{\deg} (from the vertical axis of the system). Thanks to IXPE, we have measured the X-ray polarization of NGC 1068 and found comparable results, both in terms of polarization angle orientation with respect to the radio-jet and torus half-opening angle, to the X-ray polarimetric measurement achieved for the other archetypal Compton-thick AGN : the Circinus galaxy. Probing the geometric arrangement of parsec-scale matter in extragalactic object is now feasible thanks to X-ray polarimetry.   

Probing the emission mechanism and nature of the pulsating compact

  Recently, there has been renewed interest in the Be X-ray binary (Be/XRB) SAX J1324.4-6200 because of its spatial coincidence with a gamma-ray source detected by Fermi/LAT. To explore more thoroughly its properties, new observations were carried out in 2023 by NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Swift, jointly covering the energy range 0.2-79 keV. The X-ray spectrum of SAX J1324.4-6200 fits well with an absorbed power law with a high energy cut-off. We measured a NuSTAR spin period of 175.8127 +/- 0.0036 s and an XMM-Newton spin period of 175.862 +/- 0.025 s. All the available spin period measurements of SAX J1324.4-6200, spanning 29 years, are correlated with time, resulting in a remarkably stable spin-down of dP/dt=(6.09 +/- 0.06)*1E-9 s/s. If SAX J1324.4-6200 hosts an accretion powered pulsar, accretion torque models indicate a surface magnetic field of ~1E12-1E13 G. The X-ray properties emerging from our analysis strenghten the hypothesis that SAX J1324.4-6200 belongs to the small group of persistent Be/XRBs. We also performed radio observations with the Parkes Murriyang telescope, to search for radio pulsations. However, no radio pulsations compatible with the rotational ephemeris of SAX J1324.4-6200 were detected. We rule out the hypothesis that SAX J1324.4-6200 is a gamma-ray binary where the emission is produced by interactions between the pulsar and the companion winds. Other models commonly used to account for the production of gamma-rays in accreting pulsars cannot reproduce the bright emission from SAX J1324.4-6200. We examined other mechanisms for the gamma-ray emission and noted that there is a ~0.5% chance probability that an unknown extragalactic AGN observed through the Galactic plane may coincidentally fall within the Fermi/LAT error circle of the source and be the responsible of the gamma-ray emission.

  We investigate the torus size -- luminosity relation of Type 1 AGNs based on the reverberation-mapping analysis using the light curves of the optical continuum and the IR continuum obtained with the W1 and W2-bands of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) survey. The final sample consists of 446 and 416 AGNs, respectively, for W1 and W2-band light curves, covering a large dynamic range of bolometric luminosity from $10^{43.4}$ to $10^{47.6}$ $erg \, s^{-1}$, which show reliable lag measurements based on our quality assessment analysis. After correcting for the accretion disk contamination in the observed IR flux, we constrain the torus size ($R_{dust}$) and AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) relationship with the best-fit slope of 0.39 (0.33) for the W1- (W2-) band, which is shallower than expected from the dust radiation equilibrium model. By combining the previous K-band lag measurements, we find that the measured torus size depends on the observed wavelength of the dust radiation, as $R_{dust,K}:R_{dust,W1}:R_{dust,W2}$ = 1.0:1.5:1.8 ($R_{dust} \, \propto \, \lambda^{0.80}$) at $L_{bol}$ = $10^{46} \, erg \, s^{-1}$, confirming a stratified structure of the torus, where wavelength-dependent emissions originate from distinct regions of the torus. By investigating the deviation from the best-fit torus size -- luminosity relation, we find a moderate correlation between the offset from the $R_{dust}$--$L_{bol}$ relation and Eddington ratio. This suggests a possible influence of the Eddington ratio on the observed flattening of the $R_{dust}$--$L_{bol}$ relationship.

  It is well established that AGNs play an important role in the evolution of galaxies. These AGNs can be linked to the accretion processes onto massive black holes and past merger events in their host galaxies, which may lead to different alignments of the jets with respect to the host galaxies. This paper presents a study of the PA differences between radio and optical images of radio AGNs based on the LoTSS DR2, the FIRST, the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and the SDSS. We assessed PA measurement biases in the data and classified the radio AGNs based on the radio luminosity and infrared colour from the WISE. This resulted in the largest yet published sample of 3682 radio AGNs with reliable radio and optical PA measurements. The PA difference (dPA) distributions for the radio AGN sample show a prominent minor-axis alignment tendency. Based on some simple assumptions, we simulated the projection effect to estimate the intrinsic jet-galaxy alignment. The observed dPA distribution can be well described by a two-component jet-alignment model in which one component is more aligned with the minor axis of the host galaxy than the other. The fitting results indicate that the jet alignment is dependent on radio luminosity and the shape of the host galaxies, with the jets being more likely to be aligned with the minor axis of the galaxy for lower radio luminosity and for optically more elongated radio AGNs. The minor-axis alignment of the entire sample may suggest a coherent accretion model present in most AGN host galaxies, while a considerable number of luminous radio-AGN with massive host galaxies might have undergone an accretion according to the chaotic model or past merger events.   

How long will the quasar UV/optical flickering be damped?

  The UV/optical light curves of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are commonly described by the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model. However, the physical interpretation of the damping timescale, a key parameter in the DRW model, remains unclear. Particularly, recent observations indicate a weak dependence of the damping timescale upon both wavelength and accretion rate, clearly being inconsistent with the accretion-disk theory. In this study, we investigate the damping timescale in the framework of the Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, a physical model that describes AGN variability. We find that while the CHAR model can reproduce the observed power spectral densities of the 20-year light curves for 190 sources from \cite{Stone2022}, the observed damping timescale, as well as its weak dependence on wavelength, can also be well recovered through fitting the mock light curves with DRW. We further demonstrate that such weak dependence is artificial due to the effect of inadequate durations of light curves, which leads to best-fitting damping timescales lower than the intrinsic ones. After eliminating this effect, the CHAR model indeed yields a strong dependence of the intrinsic damping timescale on the bolometric luminosity and rest-frame wavelength. Our results highlight the demand for sufficiently long light curves in AGN variability studies and important applications of the CHAR model in such studies.
