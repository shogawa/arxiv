  SDSS-C4 3028 is a galaxy cluster at $z=0.061$, notable for its unusually high fraction of star-forming galaxies with 19 star-forming and 11 quiescent spectroscopically-confirmed member galaxies. From Subaru/HSC imaging, we derived a weak lensing mass of $M_{200} = (1.3 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, indicating a low-mass cluster. This is in excellent agreement with its dynamical mass of $M_{200} = (1.0\pm0.4)\times10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, derived from SDSS spectroscopic data. XMM-Newton observations reveal that its X-ray emission is uniform and fully consistent with the astrophysical X-ray background, with no evidence for an intracluster medium (ICM). The 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $L_{\rm X}(0.1-2.4\rm keV)=7.7\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ on the cluster's X-ray luminosity falls below the value expected from the $L_{\rm X}-M_{\rm halo}$ scaling relation of nearby galaxy clusters. We derived star-formation histories for its member galaxies using the photometric spectral energy distribution from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE data. Most of its quiescent galaxies reside within the central 300 kpc, while star-forming ones dominate the outer region (300 kpc - 1 Mpc). The core region has formed the bulk of its stellar mass approximately 1.5 Gyr earlier than the outskirts. We infer a long quenching time of $&gt;3$ Gyr for its quiescent galaxies, consistent with slow quenching mechanisms such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or strangulation. These findings suggest that SDSS-C4 3028 may have undergone an "inside-out" formation and quenching process. Its ICM may have been expelled by intense AGN feedback after core formation but before full cluster assembly. The high fraction ($\sim$0.63) of star-forming members likely results from the absence of ram pressure stripping in this blue cluster, supporting the important role of ram pressure stripping in quenching galaxies in clusters.

  Axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling candidates for dark matter and potential portals to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Photons traversing magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic, energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the properties of the intervening magnetic fields.   Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity.   In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for axion-like particles.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit stochastic optical variability, commonly characterized by a damped random walk. The damping timescale is of particular interest because it is related to fundamental properties of the central black hole, such as its mass and accretion rate. However, the systematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited observational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all available data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria to avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range of AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the underlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we introduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and leverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements. Rather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT robustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN physical properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness using mock light curves and show that it successfully reconciles previous inconsistent results based on two independent AGN samples. Our BADDAT method will have broad applications in AGN variability studies during the era of time-domain astronomy.

  Heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), especially Compton-thick sources with line-of-sight column density ($N_{\rm H,los}$) $&gt;$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, are critical to understanding supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth and the origin of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). However, their observed fraction remains significantly below model predictions, due to strong absorption bias, even in the hard X-ray (i.e., above 10 keV) band. We analyze a sample of 26 nearby ($z &lt; 0.1$) AGN from the Swift-BAT 150-month catalog, selected via mid-IR to X-ray diagnostics and observed with NuSTAR and soft X-ray telescopes (Xmm-Newton, Chandra, or Swift-xrt). Using self-consistent torus models (MyTorus, Borus02, and UXCLUMPY), we aim to constrain $N_{\rm H,los}$, the average torus column density, and other geometrical parameters of the obscuring medium. A comparative analysis among the three torus models showed that while estimates of $N_{\rm{H,los}}$ were generally in agreement, Borus02 tended to classify a slightly larger number of sources as Compton-thick AGN (CT-AGN). Building on this comparison, we benchmark two prediction schemes -- a mid-IR/X-ray relation and a machine-learning model -- against our broadband best-fit $N_{\rm H,los}$ measurements to assess which approach more effectively bridges the gap between predicted and measured obscuration, finding that while the former works effectively in the heavily obscured region (log$\rm{N_H} \gtrsim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$), the latter provides improved accuracy, particularly for Compton-thin to moderately thick regimes (log$\rm{N_H} \lesssim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$).

  AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact radio emission, unresolved at a scale of &lt;~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~&gt; 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.

  JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5&lt;z&lt;7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.
