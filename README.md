  The Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope (SST-1M) is an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope designed for detecting very high-energy gamma rays. With a compact design achieved through the adoption of silicon-photomultiplier pixels and a lightweight structure, SST-1M offers a large field of view of about 9{\deg} and features a mirror system of 4 m diameter with an optical PSF (at 80% of photon inclusion) of 0.08{\deg} on axis and 0.21{\deg} at 4{\deg} off-axis, and a fully digitizing readout almost deadtime free up to few kHz. The SST-1M achieved a high-performance and cost-effective solution for implementing an array of small-sized telescopes. The stereoscopic system of two SST-1Ms is temporarily installed at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory in the Czech Republic. From an altitude of only about 510 m and in harsh meteorological conditions, the system is detecting galactic sources and flares of AGNs. The accurate calibration of the detector and the simulation benchmark are ongoing. The results of its performance are shown. A future final location is being considered and a future performance outlook is discussed.

  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are generally known to be radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), but a tiny subset of them are found to be extremely radio-loud with radio loudness parameter ($R_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$) $&gt;$ 100. Given their rarity we investigated intra-night optical variability (INOV) and radio characteristics of a sample of 16 extremely radio-loud NLS1s. For all but four sample sources we report intra-night photometric monitoring for the first time with at least one monitoring session per source lasting for a minimum of 3.0 hours duration. In our sample, we detect INOV with a high duty cycle (up to 25 per cent) and large average amplitude ($\overline{\psi}$ $\sim$ 0.16) similar to that found in blazars. Using 3.0 GHz Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and auxiliary multi-frequency radio data we find that our RL-NLS1s are luminous ($L_{\rm 3.0~GHz}$ $\geq$ 10$^{24}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$), compact (less than a few kpc), variable, flat spectrum (${\alpha}_{\rm radio}$ $&gt;$ -0.5) radio sources. The INOV, radio characteristics, and radio luminosity ($L_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$) versus super-massive black hole mass ($M_{\rm SMBH}$) plot infer that extremely radio-loud NLS1s are low-$z$ and low-luminosity analogs of flat spectrum radio quasars wherein the former are powered by, on average, one order-of-magnitude less massive SMBHs.

  NGC 4258 is a prime target for studying feedback in Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs) due to its proximity and comprehensive multi-wavelength coverage. Using new Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data from SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we analysed the galaxy's nebular emission lines. Our study focused on spatially resolved line ratios and Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagrams, revealing that the ''anomalous spiral arms'' exhibit intense interactions between the jet and interstellar medium (ISM) extending up to 6 kpc with velocity dispersions peak at 200-250 km/s in these regions, contrasting with star-forming areas showing lower values around of 30-50 km/s. Analysis of covering fractions indicates heightened AGN ionization cones aligned with the radio jet, alongside evidence of shock quenching observed in the lower "anomalous arc". Conversely, jet-induced compression may stimulate star formation in other areas. We derived a galaxy-wide star formation rate of $\sim3 M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ decreasing to $0.3 M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ within the central $3.4 \mathrm{kpc}^2$. SITELLE's broad field coverage elucidates the galaxy's structural details, confirming that low-power jets significantly influence the host galaxy across parsec and kpc scales. The velocity dispersion map reveals asymmetric or double-peaked emission lines, tracing jet-disk interactions likely responsible for the formation of anomalous arm features. Small-scale ionizing clusters were detected in regions with disrupted gas flows, possibly formed through tidal interactions or shock compression. NGC~4258 thus presents a compelling case for studying LLAGN-driven feedback, illustrating how optical IFS combined with multi-wavelength data clarifies the impact of outflows and shocks on nearby spiral galaxies, providing insights into how these processes shape star formation and ISM conditions.

  The combination of the $z=0-13.5$ cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history as inferred by the James Webb Space Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 1 - 100\%$ for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could have achieved reionisation by $z\approx 6$ with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} \gtrsim 10-30\%$, depending on the metallicity. On the other hand, AGN by themselves would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 100\%$. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is explored where we find best fit (median$\pm 1\sigma$) $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 12\%$ ($12^{+10}_{-11}\%$) for the stars and $f_{\mathrm{esc}}= 63\%$ ($79^{+21}_{-44}\%$) for the AGN, maintained at all redshifts. In essence, the joint growth of stellar mass and super massive black holes produces neither more or less ionising photons than needed to reionise $\gtrsim 99\%$ of the intergalactic medium by $z\approx 6$.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as ''Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free $10^6 \, M_\odot$ SMS. We establish that its luminosity ($L_\lambda \approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \mu\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the V-shaped Balmer break morphology is shown to be an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$\beta$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.
