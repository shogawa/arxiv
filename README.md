  We present the first optical-UV spectral systematic analysis of 30 Type 1 AGN selected in the FIR and X-ray in the Lockman-SpReSO Survey. The sample of faint objects (m_B = 19.6-21.8) covers a large redshift range of 0.33 &gt; z &gt; 4.97 with high S/N (~21 on average). A detailed spectral analysis based on the Quasar Main Sequence phenomenology prescription was applied to deblend the principal optical-UV emitting regions. Our sample spans a bolometric luminosity range of 44.85 &lt; log Lbol &lt; 47.87, absolute B-magnitude -20.46 &gt; M_B &gt; -26.14, BH mass of 7.59 &lt; log MBH &lt; 9.80, and Eddington ratio -1.70 &lt; log REdd &lt; 0.56. The analysis shows that 18 high-z objects correspond to Population B, whereas three low-z fall in Populations A2, B1, and B1+. The remaining eight are candidates to be Pop. B and one Pop. A object. None of them are extreme accretors. We looked for tendencies in our sample and compared them with other samples with different selection criteria. Evidence for winds was explored using CIV1549 line half-height centroid cmed finding wind velocities between 941 and -1587 kms-1. This result is consistent with samples with similar ranges of z and M_B. The Baldwin effect showed a slope of -0.23 pm 0.03 dex consistent with previous studies. Spectra from twelve objects in our sample were found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 database. We applied the same methodology to compare them to our spectra, finding no evidence of variability.

  The $L_{\rm IR}-L_{\rm HCN}$ relation suggests that there is a tight connection between dense gas and star formation. We use data from the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS) to investigate the dense gas - star formation relation in AGN hosting galaxies, and the use of dense gas as an active galactic nuclei (AGN) diagnostic. Our sample contains five Type-1 (unobscured) AGN that were observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the aim to detect HCN(4-3), HCO$^+$(4-3) and CS(7-6). We detect the dense gas emission required for this analysis in 3 of the 5 targets. We find that despite the potential impact from the AGN on the line fluxes of these sources, they still follow the $L_{\rm IR}-L_{\rm HCN}$ relation. We then go on to test claims that the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CS line ratios can be used as a tool to classify AGN in the sub-mm HCN diagram. We produce the classic ionised emission-line ratio diagnostics (the so-called BPT diagrams), using available CARS data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We then compare the BPT classification with the sub-mm classification made using the dense gas tracers. Where it was possible to complete the analysis we find general agreement between optical and sub-mm classified gas excitation mechanisms. This suggests that AGN can contribute to the excitation of both the low density gas in the warm ionised medium and the high density gas in molecular clouds simultaneously, perhaps through X-ray, cosmic ray or shock heating mechanisms.

  Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei (CLAGN) are a rare subset of AGN that show significant changes to the flux of broad Balmer emission lines. Recent studies of CLAGN, such as 1ES 1927+654 and Mrk 590, have revealed that changes in the optically observed accretion rate are accompanied by changes in radio activity. We present a time-domain population study of 474 spectroscopically confirmed CLAGN at radio wavelengths using the Australia SKA Pathfinder Variable and Slow Transients Survey and the Very Large Array Sky Survey. We compare the radio properties of this CLAGN sample to a control sample of AGN that have not had recent changing-look events, and to AGN that were found to have transitioned from radio-quiet to radio-loud over 10-year timescales in VLASS. For 20 newly studied CLAGN detected in ASKAP VAST, we do not detect Mrk 590 or 1ES 1927+654-like fading of the radio flux in the 10 years following changing-look events. For 6 CLAGN with a sufficiently low redshift and high enough mass, we rule out a Mrk 590-like flare. We find that at the population level, CLAGN have higher VAST/VLASS detection rates, lower fractions of radio loudness, and higher variability rates in the 1 GHz frequency compared to the control AGN. Through VLA observations of radio SEDs and Magellan spectroscopic observations, we do not find evidence of a link between CLAGN and AGN that transitioned from radio-loud to radio-quiet in VLASS. We discuss the implications of this study for the physical mechanisms that drive enhanced accretion episodes.

  Understanding the relationship between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies at different redshifts is crucial for unraveling the processes of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution. We present the properties of nine type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at intermediate redshift ($2&lt;z&lt;4$) using the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). All of them show the significant $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ broad line and the AGN contribution in spectral energy distribution. Our sample covers SMBH masses of $10^{6.1-8.2}\ M_\odot$ and stellar masses of $10^{9.3-11.0}\ M_\odot$, comparable to those of the AGNs observed in the local universe. In the low-mass SMBH regime ($&lt;10^{8}\ M_\odot$), the BH-to-stellar mass ratios in our sample ($0.01-0.1\%$) differ from those of the AGNs at $z&gt;4$ ($1-10\%$), suggesting that black holes and galaxies may trace different evolutionary pathways at intermediate and high redshift. We also perform 2D image decomposition using GALFIT to constrain the bulge mass by evaluating the bulge contribution in the rest-frame near-infrared flux. We identify the AGNs with low BH-to-bulge mass ratios compared to those observed in the nearby bulge-dominant galaxies. This finding suggests the existence of a galaxy-first evolutionary path, in which bulge formation occurs before substantial gas is efficiently accreted onto the central engine.

  We present a comprehensive study of five nearby active galaxies featuring large (tens of kpc) extended emission-line regions (EELRs). The study is based on large-format integral field spectroscopic observations conducted with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The spatially resolved kinematics of the ionized gas and stellar components show signs of rotation, bi-conical outflows, and complex behavior likely associated with past interactions. Analysis of the physical conditions of the EELRs indicates that in these systems, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is the primary ionization source. Using radiative transfer simulations, we compare the ionization state across the EELRs to estimate the required AGN bolometric luminosities at different radial distances. Then, considering the projected light travel time, we reconstruct the inferred AGN luminosity curves. We find that all sources are consistent with a fading trend in intrinsic AGN luminosity by 0.2--3 dex over timescales of 40,000--80,000 years, with a time dependence consistent with previous studies of fading AGNs. These results support the hypothesis that most AGN undergo significant fluctuations in their accretion rates over multiple timescales ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years, as proposed by existing theoretical models. These results provide new insights into the transient phases of AGN activity at previously unexplored scales and their potential long-term impact on their host galaxies through various feedback mechanisms.

  Many theoretical and observational studies have suggested that galaxy mergers may trigger enhanced star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity. We present an analysis of merging and nonmerging galaxies from $0.2 \leq z \leq 3$ in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. These galaxies encompass a range of masses ($M_\star &gt; 10^{8}M_\odot$), multiple merger stages, and mass ratios ($\geq1:10$). We examine the effect that galaxy mergers have on star formation and black hole accretion rates in the TNG50 universe. We additionally investigate how galaxy and black hole mass, merger stage, merger mass ratio, and redshift affect these quantities. Mergers in our sample show excess specific star formation rates (sSFR) at $z \leq 3$ and enhanced specific black hole accretion rates (sBHAR) at $z \lesssim 2$. The difference between sSFRs and sBHARs in the merging sample compared to the non-merging sample increases as redshift decreases. Additionally, we show that these enhancements persist for at least $\sim1$ Gyr after the merger event. Investigating how mergers behave in the TNG50 simulation throughout cosmic time enables both a better appreciation of the importance of spatial resolution in cosmological simulations and a better basis to understand our high-$z$ universe with observations from \textit{JWST}.

  The population of unresolved stellar-mass black hole binaries (sBBHs) is expected to produce a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) potentially detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this work, we compute the imprint of astrophysical environmental effect--such as gas dynamical friction and accretion--on this background. Using the sBBHs population constraints obtained by the LIGO--Virgo--Kagra collaboration, we compute the expected SGWB and develop a phenomenological parametric model that can accurately capture the effect of dynamical friction and accretion. Using our model, we perform Bayesian inference on simulated signals to assess the detectability of these environmental effects. We find that even for large injected values of the Eddington ratio, the effect of accretion in the SGWB is undetectable by LISA. However, LISA will be able to constrain the effect of dynamical friction with an upper bound on the gas density of $\rho \lesssim 7.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{g \, cm^{-3}}$, thus probing the sBBH environment forming in typical thin accretion disks around Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). For injected densities of $\rho \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9} \mathrm{g} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, dynamical friction effects can be well measured and clearly distinguished from vacuum, with Bayes factors reaching up to $\sim$ 60, even when the Galactic foreground is included.

  One important question in active galactic nucleus (AGN) is how gas is brought down to the galaxy center. Both internal secular evolution (torque induced by non-axisymmetric galactic structures such as bars) and external processes (e.g. mergers or interactions) are expected to redistribute the angular momentum (AM) and transport gas inward. However, it is still under debate whether these processes can significantly affect AGN activities. Here we for the first time report that AGN fraction increases with the difference of kinematic position angles ($\Delta PA\equiv|PA_{\mathrm{gas}}-PA_{\mathrm{star}}|$) between ionized gas ($PA_{\mathrm{gas}}$) and stellar disks ($PA_{\mathrm{star}}$) in blue and green galaxies, meanwhile this fraction remains roughly constant for red galaxies. Also the high luminosity AGN fraction increases with $\Delta PA$ while the low luminosity AGN fraction is independent with $\Delta PA$. These observational results support a scenario in which the interaction between accreted and pre-existing gas provides the AM loss mechanism, thereby the gas inflow fuels the central BH activities, and the AM loss efficiency is positively correlated with the $\Delta PA$.

  Supermassive disks are outstanding galaxies whose formation and evolution are still poorly understood. They comprise a large variety of objects, ranging from large, low-surface-brightness galaxies, such as Malin 1, to the most spectacular superluminous spirals. However, we still do not know the physical mechanisms behind its formation, and whether they will be long-lived objects or whether their mass could destroy them in time. We aim to investigate the formation and evolution of these galaxies using the magnetohydrodynamical state-of-the-art simulation IllustrisTNG-100. We defined supermassive disks as galaxies with $\lambda / \sqrt{\varepsilon} \geq 0.31$ or 0.71, and with stellar mass log$_{10}M_\star/M_\odot &gt; 10^{11}$. We studied the color, merging history, AGN history, and environment in which these galaxies reside. Supermassive disk galaxies typically experience a quiescent merging history, with $48\%$ experiencing no significant mergers at $z \leq 1$. Their stellar mass growth is driven mainly by star formation, unlike spheroidal galaxies, which require a significant number of mergers to form. Moreover, the mergers experienced by disk galaxies are generally rich in gas content, irrespective of whether they are minor or major events. Supermassive disks exist across various environments, from isolation to clusters, with $\sim 60\%$ inhabiting in isolation or low-mass groups, $\sim 25\%$ residing in massive groups, and $\sim15\%$ residing within galaxy clusters. When studying the evolution of supermassive disks selected at $z=0.5$, we show that when they gain sufficient mass, the probability of them maintaining their disk-like structure up to $z=0$ is relatively high ($\sim 60\%$). Lastly, while AGN significantly influences the regulation of star formation in galaxies, it does not directly alter their morphological structure.

  We present the high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster core using the XRISM satellite. Despite previous observations revealing multiple cold fronts and dynamical disturbances in the cluster core, our XRISM observations show low gas velocity dispersions of \sigma_v = 115 +/- 7 km s^{-1} in the inner region (~&lt; 25 kpc) and \sigma_v = 186 +/- 9 km s^{-1} in the outer region (~ 25-50 kpc). The gas temperatures are kT = 5.5 +/- 0.2 keV and 8.4 +/- 0.2 keV for the inner and outer regions, respectively, with metal abundances of Z = 0.75 +/- 0.03 Z_sun (inner) and 0.44 +/- 0.02 Z_sun (outer). The measured velocity dispersions correspond to nonthermal pressure fractions of only 1.4 +/- 0.2% (inner) and 2.5 +/- 0.2% (outer), indicating highly subsonic turbulence. Our analysis of the bulk gas motion indicates that the gas in the inner region is nearly at rest relative to the central galaxy (|v_bulk|=8 +/- 7 km s^{-1}), while the outer region exhibits a moderate motion of |v_bulk|=104 +/- 7 km s^{-1}. Assuming the velocity dispersion arises from turbulent motions, the turbulent heating rate is only ~ 40% of the radiative cooling rate, although there is some uncertainty. This suggests that the heating and cooling of the gas are not balanced. The activity of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has apparently weakened. The sloshing motion that created the cold fronts may now be approaching a turning point at which the velocity is minimum.
