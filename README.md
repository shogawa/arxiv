  We present accretion disc size measurements for the well-known quasar 3C 273 using reverberation mapping (RM) performed on high-cadence light-curves in seven optical filters collected with the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO). Lag estimates obtained using Javelin and PyROA are consistent with each other and yield accretion disc sizes a factor of ~2-7 larger than `thin disc' theoretical expectations. This makes 3C 273 one of a growing number of active galactic nuclei (AGN) to display the so-called `accretion disc size' problem usually observed in low-luminosity AGN. Power-law fits of the form tau~lambda^beta to the lag spectrum, and nufnu ~ nu^beta to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the variations, both give results consistent with the `thin disc' theoretical expectation of beta=4/3. The Starkey et al. `flat disc with a steep rim' model can fit both the lag estimates and the SED variations. Extrapolating the observed optical lags to putative dust-forming regions of the disc gives r~100-200 light-days. These radii are consistent with the size of the broad line region (BLR) as determined by near-infrared interferometric studies as well as with the best-fit location of the outer edge for the `flat disc with a steep rim' model. Therefore, the accretion disc in 3C 273 might be sufficiently extended to be dusty, allowing the BLR to emerge from it in a dusty outflow. A flux variation gradient analysis and the structure function of our LCO light-curves confirm that the optical variability in 3C 273 is dominated by the accretion disc rather than its radio jet.

  JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is a unique test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the $z=7.045$ multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to $18\pm3$ % for H$\alpha$ and up to $22\pm8$ % in H$\beta$, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}=4\times10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.

  We employ the SIMBA-C cosmological simulation to study the impact of its upgraded chemical enrichment model (Chem5) on the distribution of metals in the intragroup medium (IGrM). We investigate the projected X-ray emission-weighted abundance profiles of key elements over two decades in halo mass ($10^{13} \leq M_{500}/\mathrm{M_\odot} \leq 10^{15}$). Typically, SIMBA-C generates lower-amplitude abundance profiles than SIMBA with flatter cores, in better agreement with observations. For low-mass groups, both simulations over-enrich the IGrM with Si, S, Ca, and Fe compared to observations, a trend likely related to inadequate modeling of metal dispersal and mixing. We analyze the 3D mass-weighted abundance profiles, concluding that the lower SIMBA-C IGrM abundances are primarily a consequence of fewer metals in the IGrM, driven by reduced metal yields in Chem5, and the removal of the instantaneous recycling of metals approximation employed by SIMBA. Additionally, an increased IGrM mass in low-mass SIMBA-C groups is likely triggered by changes to the AGN and stellar feedback models. Our study suggests that a more realistic chemical enrichment model broadly improves agreement with observations, but physically motivated sub-grid models for other key processes, like AGN and stellar feedback and turbulent diffusion, are required to realistically reproduce observed group environments.
