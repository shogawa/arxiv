  The Quick Ultra-Violet Kilonova surveyor (QUVIK), a two-band UV space telescope approved for funding as a Czech national science and technology mission, will focus on detecting early UV light of kilonovae (Werner et al., 2024). In addition, it will study the UV emission of stars and stellar systems (Krti\v{c}ka et al., 2024) as well as the intense and variable emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) or galactic nuclei activated by tidal disruption events (Zaja\v{c}ek et al., 2024). In this contribution, we describe the role of this small ($\sim 30$-cm diameter) UV telescope for studying bright, nearby AGN. With its NUV and FUV bands, the telescope will perform high-cadence ($\sim$ 0.1-1 day) two-band photometric monitoring of nearby AGN ($z&lt;1$), which will allow us to probe accretion disk sizes/temperature profiles via photometric reverberation mapping. Thanks to its versatility, QUVIK will be able to perform a moderately fast repointing ($&lt;20$ min) to target candidates for tidal disruption events (TDEs). Early detection of the UV emission following a TDE optical flare, in combination with the subsequent two-band UV monitoring performed simultaneously with other observatories, will enable us to infer the time delay (or its lack of) between the optical, UV, and X-ray emission. In combination with theoretical models, it will be possible to shed more light on the origin of the UV/optical emission of TDEs. Furthermore, the two-band monitoring of nuclear transients will be beneficial in distinguishing between TDEs (nearly constant blue colour) and supernovae (progressive reddening).

  Several processes in the Universe convert a fraction of gas kinetic energy into the acceleration of relativistic electrons, making them observable at radio wavelengths, or contributing to a dormant reservoir of low-energy cosmic rays in cosmic structures. We present a new suite of cosmological simulations, with simple galaxy formation models calibrated to work at a specific spatial resolution, tailored to study all most important processes of injection of relativistic electrons in evolving large-sale structures: accretion and merger shocks, feedback from active galactic nuclei and winds from star forming regions. We also follow the injection of magnetic fields by active galactic nuclei and star formation, and compute the observational signatures of these mechanisms. We find that the injection of cosmic ray electrons by shocks is the most volume filling process, and that it also dominates the energy density of fossil relativistic electrons in halos. The combination of the seeding mechanisms studied in this work, regardless of the uncertainties related to physical or numerical uncertainties, is more than enough to fuel large-scale radio emissions with a large amount of seed fossil electrons. We derive an approximated formula to predict the number of fossil cosmic ray electrons injected by z=0 by the total activity of shocks, AGN and star formation in the volume of halos. By looking at the maximum possible contribution to the magnetisation of the cosmic web by all our simulated sources, we conclude that galaxy formation-related processes, alone, cannot explain the values of Faraday Rotation of background polarised sources recently detected using LOFAR.

  We study in detail how massive galaxies accrete gas through cosmic time using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the High-z Evolution of Large and Luminous Objects (HELLO) and the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO) projects. We find that accretion through cold filaments at high redshift (z ~ 2-4) is a key factor in maintaining the high star formation rates (&gt; 100 Msun/yr) observed in these galaxies, and that more than 75% of the total gas participating in the star formation process is accreted via this channel at high z even in haloes well above 10^12 Msun. The low volume occupancy of the filaments allows plenty of space for massive gas outflows generated by the vigorous star formation and AGN activity, with the cold incoming gas and the hot outflowing gas barely interacting. We present a model based on a Bayesian hierarchical formalism that accurately describes the evolution of the cold fraction accretion with redshift and halo mass. Our model predicts a relatively constant critical mass (Mc) for the cold-to-hot transition up to z ~ 1.3 and an evolving critical mass log(Mc) proportional to log(1+z)^1.7 at higher redshift. Overall, our findings provide deeper insight into the cosmic evolution of gas accretion modes and offer a robust framework for understanding how cold accretion contributes to galaxy growth across different epochs.

  The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is dominated by the obscured and unobscured coronal light of active galactic nuclei (AGN). At energies below 10 keV, the CXB can be well explained by models taking into account the known AGN and the observed distribution of their obscuring, line-of-sight column densities, $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$. However, at energies around the Compton reflection hump ($\sim30$ keV), the models fall short of the data. This suggests the existence of a population of as yet undetected Compton-thick AGN ($N_{\rm H,l.o.s}&gt;1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) whose X-ray spectra are dominated by the light that has been reprocessed by the obscuring material. In this work, we continue the effort to find and catalog all local ($z&lt;0.05$) Compton-thick (CT) AGN. To this end, we obtained soft X-ray data with Chandra for six local BAT detected sources lacking ROSAT (0.1-2.4 keV) counterparts, indicating potential obscuration. We fit their spectra with Bayesian and least squares methods using two different models, borus02 and UXCLUMPY. We compare the results of the different models and methods and find that the $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$ is consistently measured in each case. Three of the sources also were observed with XMM-Newton allowing the opportunity to search for variability in soft X-ray flux or $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$. From this sample, we find one strong CT candidate (NGC 5759) and one weaker CT candidate (CGCG 1822.3+2053). Furthermore, we find tentative evidence of $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$ variability in 2MASX J17253053-4510279, which has $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}&lt;10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.   

Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Hot CGM Gas: An Inverse-Compton Origin for
  Diffuse X-ray Emission in the Circumgalactic Medium

  Observations have argued that Milky Way (MW), Andromeda, and lower-mass galaxies exhibit extended soft X-ray diffuse halos to radii $R\gtrsim100\,$kpc in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). If interpreted as thermal emission, the shallow surface brightness profiles $S_{X}\propto R^{-1}$ are difficult to explain and contradict other observations. We show that such halos instead arise from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons with GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons. GeV electrons have ~Gyr lifetimes and escape the galaxy, forming a shallow extended profile out to $\gtrsim100\,$kpc, where IC off the CMB should produce soft, thermal-like X-ray spectra peaked at ~keV. The observed keV halo luminosities and brightness profiles agree well with those expected for CRs observed in the local interstellar medium (LISM) escaping the galaxy, with energetics consistent with known CRs from SNe and/or AGN, around galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\ast}\lesssim2\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$. At higher masses observed X-ray luminosities are larger than predicted from IC and should be dominated by hot gas. In the MW+M31, the same models of escaping CRs reproduce gamma-ray observations if we assume an LISM-like proton-to-electron ratio and CR-pressure-dominated halo. In all other halos, the radio and $\gamma$-ray brightness is below detectable limits. If true, the observations provide qualitatively new constraints on CGM and CR physics: X-ray brightness directly traces the CR lepton energy density in the CGM. This agrees with LISM values within 10 kpc, which following the profile expected for escaping CRs in the CGM. The inferred CR pressure is a major part of the MW CGM pressure budget. X-ray surface brightness and luminosity allows one to further determine the CGM diffusivity at radii $\sim10-1000\,$kpc. These also agree with LISM values at small radii but increase in the CGM.

  We present the study of the gas kinematics in narrow-line regions (NLRs) of 2,009 type-2 AGNs at $z&lt;0.34$. We construct the [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission-line images using publicly available broadband images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The [O III] emission area of the samples, measured down to $1.7\times10^{-15}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$, ranges from 3.7 kpc$^2$ up to 224 kpc$^2$. With our broadband technique, we found the strong correlation between [O III] area and AGN luminosity inferred from the [O III] luminosity and the mid-infrared luminosity at the rest-frame $15\mu$m. The isophotal threshold used to determine the [O III] area affects the correlation strength in that the brighter isophote yields the stronger correlation between the [O III] area and AGN luminosity. The presence of gas outflow is examined by the ratio of the [O III] velocity dispersion to the stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm [O\,III]}/\sigma_\star &gt; 1.4$) using the SDSS spectra. At the given luminosity, the objects with and without outflows exhibit the same extension of the [O III] emission. Their correlation between the [O III] area and luminosity is almost identical. It is suggested that the size of NLRs is not affected by outflow mechanisms but rather by photoionization from the central AGNS.

  Way-like Bubbles or Star Formation-driven Outflows?

  Gamma and X-ray observatories have revealed spectacular structures in the emission of the tenuous hot gas surrounding the Milky Way (MW), known as the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. Galaxy formation simulations suggest that MW-like bubbles could be ubiquitous, but their emission may be too faint to detect with today's instruments in individual external galaxies. In this paper, we present an analysis of stacked Chandra observations of 93 nearby galaxies. We detected soft, diffuse X-rays from the CGM, extending up to 14 kpc, with a luminosity of $(4.2\pm0.7)\times10^{39}$ erg/s in the $0.3-2$ keV band. To probe its spatial distribution, we constructed an azimuthal profile and found a significant enhancement along the galactic minor axis. When dividing our sample by stellar mass, central supermassive black hole mass, and star formation rate, we found that only high star formation rate galaxies exhibit significant anisotropies in the CGM emission. To investigate whether the observed anisotropies could be attributed to MW-like bubbles, we compared our results with TNG50 simulations. In these simulations, X-ray bubbles are strongly correlated with mass of the central supermassive black hole and typically extend to much larger, $\sim50$ kpc, scales. We conclude that the observed anisotropies are either caused by AGN-driven MW-like bubbles confined to smaller, $\sim10$ kpc, scales, or by star formation- or starburst-driven bubbles/outflows.
