We present JWST/MIRI imaging of eight nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the GATOS survey to investigate the physical conditions of extended dust in their narrow line regions (NLRs). In four galaxies (ESO 428-G14, NGC 4388, NGC 3081, and NGC 5728), we detect spatially resolved dust structures extending ~100-200 pc along the NLR. In these systems, we find a strong link between the morphology of the dust, the radio ejecta, and the coronal [Si VI] emission, implying that dust carries imprints of the processes shaping the NLR. Using spatially resolved spectral energy distributions, we show that dust in the NLR has systematically steeper slopes than star forming clumps. This dust emits at temperatures in the range 150 - 220 K, at a distance of ~150 pc from the nucleus. Using simple models, we show that, even under optimistic assumptions of grain size and AGN luminosity, the excess MIR emission cannot be explained by AGN illumination alone. We interpret this excess heating as in-situ. We show that shocks with velocities of $v_{\rm shock} \sim 200- 400 \, \rm km/s$ in dense gas can close this gap, and in some cases even account for the total observed emission. This, combined with multiple lines of evidence for shocks in these regions, supports a scenario in which shocks not only coexist with dust but may be playing a key role in heating it. Our findings reveal shocks may be an important and previously overlooked driver of extended dust emission in the central hundreds of parsecs in AGN.

We present photometric properties of 161 galaxy candidates at $z=7-14$ selected from the second data release (DR2) of BEACON, a JWST Cycle 2 pure-parallel NIRCam imaging program. Carefully selected from 36 independent pointings (corresponding to $\sim350$\,arcmin$^2$ sky coverage), and hence with reduced cosmic variance, our galaxy candidates provide an unbiased sample for investigating galaxy properties over a wide range of environments. We measure the physical properties, including UV continuum slope ($β_{\rm UV}$), stellar mass ($M_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and sizes. Our highest redshift galaxy candidate at $z=13.71\pm0.15$ has a remarkably bright UV luminosity of $M_{\rm UV}=-21.19\pm0.08$, making it the brightest galaxy at $z&gt;12$ if spectroscopically confirmed. With an extremely blue UV slope, compact morphology, and high star formation rate surface density ($Σ_{\rm SFR}$), this candidate may have extremely low metallicity, high ionizing photon escape fraction, or contributions from an AGN. Among our multiple independent sightlines, we identify three fields of galaxy number overdensity with $&gt;3σ$ significance. The properties of galaxies in various environments do not exhibit significant differences, implying either that accelerated galaxy evolution in overdense regions is not yet widespread at $z&gt;7$, or that the current constraints are limited by sample size. Our simulations indicate that increasing the sample by an order of magnitude would allow such environmental trends to be robustly confirmed or ruled out, underscoring the importance of future pure-parallel observations.

Using VLT/MUSE data, we study the ionised-gas kinematics in a mass- and volume-limited ($M_* \geq 10^{10} M_\odot$, $D \leq 20$\,Mpc) sample of 21 nearby galaxies to identify signatures of extended shocks within their inner kiloparsec, which appear as coherent velocity jumps in kinematic maps. By removing angular momentum, shocks in gas cause inflows, which can trigger nuclear star formation and fuel AGN activity. To identify the signatures of extended shocks, we examine residual velocity fields after subtracting a modelled rotating disc, and we study velocity difference between various gas tracers. Combining our kinematic analysis with BPT ionisation diagnostic maps and dust morphology, we find that 11 of 21 galaxies ($\sim$52%) show extended shock signatures with velocity jumps consistent with models of bar-driven shocks. This is likely a lower limit, as three additional galaxies ($\sim$15%) exhibit shocks along bars, potentially reaching the nucleus but obscured by AGN outflows. We trace shock signatures inwards close to the resolution limit, which suggests that shocks may be the prevailing mechanism of inflow in the central kpc of galaxies. The only two unbarred galaxies in our sample are also the only systems with unperturbed kinematics and no shocks, strongly linking the perturbed gas dynamics in centres of galaxies to the presence of bars. All galaxies with inner bars show LINER- or Seyfert-like nuclear emission, whereas galaxies without inner bars exhibit all emission types, indicating that regardless of gas supply, inner bars suppress star formation in galactic nuclei.  

Thick Disks, Thin Hopes: Suppressed Capture and Merger Rates in AGN

Multiple models have been suggested over the years to explain the structure and support of accretion disks around supermassive black holes, from the standard thin thermal-pressure-dominated $α$-disk model to more recent models that describe geometrically thicker radiation or magnetic or turbulence-dominated disks. In any case, objects embedded in the disk (e.g. compact objects, stars, gas, dust) can undergo gravitational and hydrodynamic interactions with each other leading to interesting processes such as binary interaction/capture, gravitational wave merger events, dynamical friction, accretion, gap opening, etc. It has long been argued that disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can enhance the rates for many of these events; however, almost all of that analysis has assumed specific thin-disk models (with aspect ratios $H/R \lesssim 0.01$). We show here that the rates for processes such as these that are mediated by gravitational cross-sections has a very strong inverse dependence on the thickness $H/R$ (scaling as steeply as $(H/R)^{-8}$), and $H/R$ can vary in the outer disk (where these processes are often invoked) by factors $\gtrsim 1000$ depending on the assumed source of pressure support in the disk. This predicts rates that can be lower by tens of orders-of-magnitude in some models, demonstrating that it is critical to account for disk parameters such as aspect ratio and different sources of disk pressure when computing any meaningful predictions for these rates. For instance, if magnetic pressure is important in the outer disk, as suggested in recent work, capture rates would be suppressed by factors $\sim 10^{10}-10^{20}$ compared to previous studies where magnetic pressure was ignored.
