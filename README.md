  Through their radio loudness, lack of thermal UV emission from the accretion disk and power-law dominated spectra, Low Luminosity AGN (LLAGN) display similarity with the hard state of stellar-mass black hole X-Ray Binaries (BHBs). In this work we perform a systematic hard X-ray spectral study of a carefully selected sample of unobscured LLAGN using archival $NuSTAR$ data, to understand the central engine properties in the lower accretion regime. We analyze the $NuSTAR$ spectra of a sample of 16 LLAGN. We model the continuum emission with detailed Comptonization models. We find a strong anti-correlation between the optical depth and the electron temperature of the corona, previously also observed in the brighter Seyferts. This anti-correlation is present irrespective of the shape of the corona, and the slope of this anti-correlation in the log space for LLAGN (0.68-1.06) closely matches that of the higher accretion rate Seyferts (0.55-1.11) and hard state of BHBs ($\sim$0.87). This anti-correlation may indicate a departure from a fixed disk-corona configuration in radiative balance. Our result, therefore, demonstrates a possible universality in Comptonization processes of black hole X-ray sources across multiple orders of magnitude in mass and accretion rate.

  We present two independent measurements of stellar velocity dispersions ( $\sigma_\rm{\star}$ ) from the Ca\,H+K \&amp; Mg\,\textsc{i} region (3880--5550~\AA) and the Calcium Triplet region (CaT, 8350--8750~\AA) for 173 hard X-ray-selected Type 1 AGNs ($z \leq$ 0.08) from the 105-month Swift-BAT catalog. We construct one of the largest samples of local Type 1 AGNs that have both single-epoch (SE) 'virial' black hole mass ($M_\rm{BH}$) estimates and $\sigma_\rm{\star}$ measurements obtained from high spectral resolution data, allowing us to test the usage of such methods for SMBH studies. We find that the two independent $\sigma_\rm{\star}$ measurements are highly consistent with each other, with an average offset of only $0.002\pm0.001$ dex. Comparing $M_\rm{BH}$ estimates based on broad emission lines and stellar velocity dispersion measurements, we find that the former is systematically lower by $\approx$0.12 dex. Consequently, Eddington ratios estimated through broad-line $M_\rm{BH}$ determinations are similarly biased (but in the opposite way). We argue that the discrepancy is driven by extinction in the broad-line region (BLR). We also find an anti-correlation between the offset from the $M_\rm{BH}$ - $\sigma_\rm{\star}$ relation and the Eddington ratio. Our sample of Type 1 AGNs shows a shallower $M_\rm{BH}$ - $\sigma_\rm{\star}$ relation (with a power law exponent of $\approx$3.5) compared with that of inactive galaxies (with a power-law exponent of $\approx$4.5), confirming earlier results obtained from smaller samples.

  We use the Horizon Run 5 cosmological simulation to study the effect of galaxy intrinsic properties and the local environment on AGNs characterized by their threshold of the accretion rate. We select galaxies in the stellar mass range $10^{9.5} \le M^{}{*}/M^{}{\odot} \le 10^{10.5}$ in the snapshot at redshift $z$=0.625. Among various intrinsic properties, we find that the star formation rate of the host galaxy is most correlated to the AGN activity. To quantify the environment, we use background galaxy number density (large-scale environment) and distance and morphological type of the nearest neighbors (small-scale environment), and study their relative effects on the AGN properties. We find that, compared to the background density, the nearest neighbor environment is the dominant quantity determining the bolometric luminosity, star formation rate, and kinematic properties of AGNs and better dictates the gas mass of the host galaxy. We show that the cold gas content in the host galaxies is crucial in triggering AGN activity. However, when the nearest neighbor environment effects start to act at the neighbor distance of less than about half the virial radius of the neighbor, the neighbor environmental effects are the most dominant factor for quasar activity.

  Announcing the final release, v8, of the Milliquas (Million Quasars) quasar catalogue which presents all published quasars to 30 June 2023, including quasars from the first releases of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the SDSS-DR18 Black Hole Mapper. Its totals are 907,144 type-I QSOs/AGN and 66,026 high-confidence (~99% likelihood) radio/X-ray associated quasar candidates. Type-II and Bl Lac type objects are also included, bringing the total count to 1,021,800. Gaia-EDR3 astrometry is given for most objects. The catalogue is available on NASA HEASARC and CDS and on its home page.
