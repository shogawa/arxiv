  Radio phoenices are complex and filamentary diffuse radio sources found in both merging and relaxed clusters. The formation of these sources was proposed to be adiabatic compression of old Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) plasma in shock waves. Most of the previous spectral studies of these sources were limited to integrated spectral indices, which were found to be very steep as well as show a curved spectrum. Here, we have performed a multi-frequency investigation of the radio phoenix in the Abell 85 cluster. Owing to the sensitive high-resolution observations, we found some of the finer filamentary structures that were previously undetected. We produced resolved spectral index maps of the radio phoenix between 148, 323, 700, and 1280 MHz. The orientation of the filaments, as well as the gradient across the spectral index maps suggest the possible direction of the shock motion from northeast to southwest. The integrated spectral index of the radio phoenix was found to be very steep with a break at around 700 MHz, indicating the re-energization of fossil electrons being recent. Furthermore, the spectral index of the filaments was found to be less steep compared to the non-filamentary regions, implying greater energy injection in the filaments. The observed features in the radio phoenix in the Abell 85 cluster seem to be in support of the adiabatic shock compression mechanism.

  The forthcoming CSST wide-field multiband imaging survey will produce seven-band photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for billions of galaxies. The effective extraction of astronomical information from these massive datasets of SEDs relies on the techniques of both SED synthesis (or modeling) and analysis (or fitting). We evaluate the performance of the latest version of BayeSED code combined with SED models with increasing complexity for simultaneously determining the photometric redshifts and stellar population parameters of galaxies in this survey. By using an empirical statistics-based mock galaxy sample without SED modeling errors, we show finding that the random observational errors in photometries are more important sources of errors than the parameter degeneracies and Bayesian analysis method and tool. By using a Horizon-AGN hydrodynamical simulation-based mock galaxy sample with SED modeling errors about the star formation histories (SFHs) and dust attenuation laws (DALs), the simple typical assumptions lead to significantly worse parameter estimation with CSST photometries only. The SED models with more flexible (or complicated) forms of SFH/DAL do not necessarily lead to better estimation of redshift and stellar population parameters. We discuss the selection of the best SED model by means of Bayesian model comparison in different surveys. Our results reveal that the Bayesian model comparison with Bayesian evidence may favor SED models with different complexities when using photometries from different surveys. Meanwhile, the SED model with the largest Bayesian evidence tends to give the best performance of parameter estimation, which is more clear for photometries with larger discriminative power.

  Spectral timing analyses based upon wavelet transforms provide a new means to study the variability of the X-ray emission from accreting systems, including AGN, stellar mass black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to trace the time variability of X-ray reverberation from the inner accretion disc. The previously-missing iron K reverberation time lags in the AGN IRAS 13224-3809 and MCG-6-30-15 are detected and found to be transitory in nature. Reverberation can be hidden during periods in which variability in the iron K band becomes dominated by ultrafast outflows (UFO). Following the time evolution of the reverberation lag between the corona and inner accretion disc, we may observe the short-timescale increase in scale height of the corona as it is accelerated away from the accretion disc during bright X-ray flares in the AGN I Zw 1. Measuring the variation of the reverberation lag that corresponds to the continuous, stochastic variations of the X-ray luminosity sheds new light on the disc-corona connection around accreting black holes. Hysteresis is observed between the X-ray count rate and the scale height of the corona, and a time lag of 10~40ks is observed between the rise in luminosity and the increase in reverberation lag. This correlation and lag are consistent with viscous propagation through the inner accretion disc, leading first to an increase in the flux of seed photons that are Comptonised by the corona, before mass accretion rate fluctuations reach the inner disc and are able to modulate the structure of the corona.
