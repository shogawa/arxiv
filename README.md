  The 4D Eigenvector 1 sequence has proven to be a highly effective tool for organizing observational and physical properties of type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this paper, we present multiple measurements of metallicity for the broad line region gas, from new or previously published data. We demonstrate a consistent trend along the optical plane of the E1 (also known as the quasar main sequence), defined by the line width of H$\beta$ and by a parameter measuring the prominence of singly-ionized iron emission. The trend involves an increase from sub-solar metallicity in correspondence with extreme Population B (weak FeII emission, large H$\beta$ FWHM) to metallicity several tens the solar value in correspondence with extreme Population A (very strong FeII optical emission, narrower H$\beta$ profiles). The data establish the metallicity as a correlate of the 4D E1/main sequence. If the very high metallicity gas ($Z \gtrsim 10 Z_\odot$) is expelled from the sphere of influence of the central black hole, as indicated by the widespread evidence of nuclear outflows and disk wind in the case of sources radiating at high Eddington ratio, then it is possible that the outflows from quasars played a role in chemically enriching the host galaxy.

  The growth of active galactic nuclei (AGN) occurs under some form of obscuration in a large fraction of the population. The difficulty in constraining this population leads to high uncertainties in cosmic X-ray background and galaxy evolution models. Using an SDSS-WISE cross-match, we target infrared luminous AGN ($W1-W2$ &gt; 0.8, and monochromatic rest-frame luminosity above $\lambda L_{\lambda}$(12$\mu$m) $\approx$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), but with passive galaxy-like optical spectra (Optically Quiescent Quasars; OQQs). We find 47 objects that show no significant [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission, a typically strong AGN optical emission line. As a comparison sample, we examine SDSS-selected Type 2 quasars (QSO2s), which show a significant [O III]$\lambda$5007 line by definition. We find a 1:16 ratio of OQQs compared to QSO2s, suggesting that the OQQ duty cycle is likely much shorter than that of QSO2s (though selection biases are not fully quantified). We consider observed properties in comparison with other galaxy types, and examine them for consistency with theories on their intrinsic nature: chiefly (a) a high covering factor for surrounding obscuring matter, preventing the detection of high-ionisation emission lines - `cocooned AGN'; or (b) ionised gas being absent on the kpc scales of the Narrow Line Region (NLR), perhaps due to a `switching on' or `young' AGN. OQQs do not obviously fit the standard paradigm for merger-driven AGN and host galaxy evolution, implying we may be missing part of the flow of AGN evolution.

  "Changing-look" Active Galactic Nuclei (CL-AGNs) are challenging our basic ideas about the physics of accretion flows and of circumnuclear gas around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Using first year Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) repeated spectroscopy of nearly 29,000 previously-known AGNs, combined with dedicated follow-up spectroscopic observations, and publicly available optical light curves, we have identified 116 CL-AGNs where (at least) one broad emission line has essentially (dis-)appeared, as well as 88 other extremely variable systems. Our CL-AGN sample, with 107 newly identified cases, is among the largest reported to date, and includes $\sim$0.4% of the AGNs re-observed in the first year of SDSS-V operations. Among our CL-AGNs, 67% exhibit dimming while 33% exhibit brightening. Our data and sample probe extreme AGN spectral variability on timescales of months to decades, including some cases of recurring transitions on surprisingly short timescales ($\lesssim$ 2 months in the rest frame). We find that CL events are preferentially found in lower Eddington ratio ($f_{Edd}$) systems: Our CL-AGNs have a $f_{Edd}$ distribution that significantly differs from that of a redshift- and a carefully constructed, luminosity-matched control sample ($p_{KS}$ $\lesssim$ 2 $\times$ $10^{-4}$ ; median $f_{Edd}$ $\approx$ 0.025 vs. 0.043). This preference for low $f_{Edd}$ strengthens previous findings of higher CL-AGN incidence at lower Eddington ratios, found in much smaller samples of spectroscopically confirmed CL-AGNs. Finally, we show that the broad MgII emission line in our CL-AGN sample tends to vary significantly less than the broad H$\beta$ emission line. Our large CL-AGN sample demonstrates the advantages and challenges in using multi-epoch spectroscopy from large surveys to study extreme AGN variability, SMBH fueling, and AGN physics.
