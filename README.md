  The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveals two large bubbles in the Galaxy, extending nearly symmetrically $\sim50^{\circ}$ above and below the Galactic center (GC). Previous simulations of bubble formation invoking active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets have assumed that the jets are vertical to the Galactic disk; however, in general, the jet orientation does not necessarily correlate with the rotational axis of the Galactic disk. Using three-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations including cosmic rays (CRs) and thermal gas, we show that the dense clumpy gas within the Galactic disk disrupts jet collimation ("failed jets" hereafter), which causes the failed jets to form hot bubbles. Subsequent buoyancy in the stratified atmosphere renders them vertical to form the symmetric Fermi and eROSITA bubbles (collectively, Galactic bubbles). We find that (1) despite the relativistic jets emanated from the GC are at various angles $\le45^{\circ}$ with respect to the rotational axis of the Galaxy, the Galactic bubbles nonetheless appear aligned with the axis; (2) the edge of the eROSITA bubbles corresponds to a forward shock driven by the hot bubbles; (3) followed by the forward shock is a tangling contact discontinuity corresponding to the edge of the Fermi bubbles; (4) assuming a leptonic model we find that the observed gamma-ray bubbles and microwave haze can be reproduced with a best-fit CR power-law spectral index of 2.4; The agreements between the simulated and the observed multi-wavelength features suggest that forming the Galactic bubbles by oblique AGN failed jets is a plausible scenario.

  We investigate the influence of star formation and instantaneous AGN feedback processes on the ionized gas velocity dispersion in a sample of 1285 emission-line galaxies with stellar masses $\log\,(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9$ from the integral-field spectroscopy SAMI Galaxy Survey. We fit both narrow and broad emission line components using aperture spectra integrated within one effective radius, while ensuring the elimination of velocity differences between the spectra of individual spaxels. Our analysis reveals that 386 (30%) galaxies can be adequately described using a single emission component while 356 (28%) galaxies require two (broad and narrow) components. Galaxies characterized by high mass, elevated star formation rate surface density, or type-2 AGN-like emissions tend to feature an additional broad emission-line component, leading to their classification as double-component galaxies. We explore the correlations between $M_*$ and gas velocity dispersions, highlighting that the prominence of the broad component significantly contributes to elevating the gas velocity dispersion. Galaxies displaying AGN-like emission based on optical definitions show enhanced gas velocity dispersions. In star-forming galaxies, both stellar mass and star-formation rate surface density substantially contribute to the velocity dispersion of the narrow component. Increased star-forming activity appears to elevate the velocity dispersion of the narrow component. The broad component exhibits a weaker dependence on stellar mass and is primarily driven by galactic outflows. We suggest that strong star forming activity leads to the formation of a broad emission-line component, but the impact on inflating gas velocity dispersion is moderate. On the other hand, AGN-driven outflows appear to be a more important contributor to the elevated velocity dispersion of the ionized gas.

  Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a rare population of hyper-luminous infrared galaxies discovered by the WISE mission. Despite the significant obscuration of the AGN by dust in these systems, pronounced broad and blue-shifted emission lines are often observed. Previous work has shown that 8 Hot DOGs, referred to as Blue-excess Hot DOGs (BHDs), present a blue excess consistent with type 1 quasar emission in their UV-optical SEDs, which has been shown to originate from the light of the obscured central engine scattered into the line of sight. We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical emission characteristics for 172 Hot DOGs through UV-MIR SED modeling and spectroscopic details, with a particular focus on the identification of BHDs. We find that while the optical emission observed in Hot DOGs is in most cases dominated by a young stellar population, 26% of Hot DOGs show a significant enough blue excess emission to be classified as BHDs. Based on their broad CIV and MgII lines, we find that the $M_{\rm BH}$ in BHDs range from $10^{8.7}$ to $10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$. When using the same emission lines in regular Hot DOGs, we find the $M_{\rm BH}$ estimates cover the entire range found for BHDs while also extending to somewhat lower values. This agreement may imply that the broad lines in regular Hot DOGs also originate from scattered light from the central engine, just as in BHDs, although a more detailed study would be needed to rule out an outflow-driven nature. Similar to $z\sim 6$ quasars, we find that Hot DOGs sit above the local relation between stellar and black hole mass, suggesting either that AGN feedback has not yet significantly suppressed the stellar mass growth in the host galaxies, or that they will be outliers of the relation when reaching $z$=0.
