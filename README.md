  We present the early science results from a blind search of the extragalactic HI 21-cm absorption lines at z $\leqslant$ 0.09 with the drift-scan observation of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We carried out the search using the data collected in 643.8 hours by the ongoing Commensal Radio Astronomy FasT Survey (CRAFTS), which spans a sky area of 3155 deg$^{2}$ and covers 44827 radio sources with a flux density greater than 12 mJy. Due to the radio frequency interference (RFI), only the relatively clean data in the frequency range of 1.3-1.45 GHz are used in the present work. Under the assumption of $T_{s}/c_{f}$ = 100 K, the total completeness-corrected comoving absorption path length spanned by our data and sensitive to Damped Lyman $\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs) are $\Delta X^{inv}$ = 8.33$\times10^3$ ($\Delta z^{inv} = 7.81\times10^{3}$) for intervening absorption. For associated absorption, the corresponding values are $\Delta X^{asc}$ = 12.8 ($\Delta z^{asc} = 11.9$). Three known HI absorbers (UGC 00613, 3C 293 and 4C +27.14) and two new HI absorbers (towards NVSS J231240-052547 and NVSS J053118+315412) are detected blindly. We fit the HI profiles with multi-components Gaussian functions and calculate the redshift (0.063, 0.066), width, flux density, optical depth and HI column densities for each absorption. Our results demonstrate the power of FAST in blindly searching HI absorbers. For absorption towards NVSS J231240-052547, the optical counterparts are faint and currently lack existing spectra. The most likely interpretation is that a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) is faint in the optical as the background source, with a faint optical absorber in between. NVSS J053118+315412 exhibits an associated absorption with a complex profile, which may suggest unsettled gas structures or gas accretion onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH).

  AT 2021loi is an optical-ultraviolet transient located at the center of its host galaxy. Its spectral features identify it as a member of the ``Bowen Fluorescence Flare'' (BFF) class. The first member of this class was considered to be related to a tidal disruption event, but enhanced accretion onto an already active supermassive black hole was suggested as an alternative explanation. AT 2021loi, having occurred in a previously-known unobscured AGN, strengthens the latter interpretation. Its light curve is similar to those of previous BFFs, showing a rebrightening approximately one year after the main peak (which was not explicitly identified, but might be the case, in all previous BFFs). An emission feature around 4680 A, seen in the pre-flare spectrum, strengthens by a factor of $\sim$2 around the optical peak of the flare, and is clearly seen as a double peaked feature then, suggesting a blend of NIII $\lambda 4640$ with HeII $\lambda4686$ as its origin. The appearance of OIII $\lambda$3133 and possible NIII $\lambda\lambda4097,4103$ (blended with H$\delta$) during the flare further support a Bowen Fluorescence classification. Here, we present ZTF, ATLAS, Keck, Las Cumbres Observatory, NEOWISE-R, $Swift$, AMI and VLA observations of AT 2021loi, making it one of the best observed BFFs to date. AT 2021loi thus provides some clarity on the nature of BFFs but also further demonstrates the diversity of nuclear transients.
