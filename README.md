  Nuclear regions of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) are powered by starbursts and/or active galactic nuclei (AGNs), often obscured by extremely high columns of gas and dust. Molecular lines in the submillimeter windows have potential to determine physical conditions of these compact obscured nuclei (CONs). We aim to reveal the distributions of HCN and HCO$^+$ emission in local U/LIRGs, and investigate whether and how they are related to galaxy properties. Using ALMA, we have conducted sensitive observations of the HCN J=3--2 and HCO$^+$ J=3--2 lines toward 23 U/LIRGs in the local Universe (z &lt; 0.07) with a spatial resolution of ~0.3" (~50--400 pc). We detected both HCN and HCO$^+$ in 21 galaxies, only HCN in one galaxy, and neither in one galaxy. The global HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratios, averaged over scales of ~0.5--4 kpc, range from 0.4 to 2.3, with an unweighted mean of 1.1. These line ratios appear to have no systematic trend with bolometric AGN luminosity or star formation rate. The line ratio varies with position and velocity within each galaxy, with an average interquartile range of 0.38 on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis. In eight out of ten galaxies known to have outflows and/or inflows, we find spatially and kinematically symmetric structures of high line ratios. These structures appear as a collimated bicone/bipole in two galaxies and as a thin spherical shell in six galaxies. Non-LTE analysis suggests that the high HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratio in outflows is predominatly influenced by the abundance ratio. Chemical model calculations indicate that the enhancement of HCN abundance in outflows is likely due to high temperature chemistry triggered by shock heating. These results imply that the HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratio can aid identifying the outflow geometry when the shock velocity of the outflows is sufficiently high to heat the gas.

  We study the X-ray power spectrum of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to investigate whether Seyfert I and II power spectra are similar or not, whether the AGN variability depends on black hole mass and accretion rate, and to compare the AGN power spectra with the Galactic X-ray black hole binaries power-spectra. We used 14-195 keV band light curves from the 157th SWIFT/BAT hard X-ray survey and we computed the mean power spectrum and excess variance of AGN in narrow black-hole mass/luminosity bins. We fitted a power-law model to the AGN power spectra, and we investigated whether the power spectrum parameters and the excess variance depend on black hole mass, luminosity and accretion rate. The Seyfert I and Seyfert II power spectra are identical, in agreement with AGN unification models. The mean AGN X-ray power spectrum has the same, power-law like shape with a slope of -1 in all AGN, irrespective of their luminosity and BH mass. We do not detect any flattening to a slope of zero at frequencies as low as 10e-9 Hz. We detect an anti-correlation between the PSD amplitude and the accretion rate, similar to what has been seen in the past in the 2-10 keV band. This implies that the variability amplitude in AGN decreases with increasing accretion rate. The universal AGN power-spectrum is consistent with the mean, 2-9 keV band Cyg X-1 power spectrum in its soft state. The mean, low frequency AGN X-ray power spectrum is consistent with the extension of the mean, 0.01-25 Hz Cyg X-1 power spectrum to lower frequencies. The agreement between the AGN and the Cyg X-1 power spectrum (either in the soft or the hard state) over many decades in frequency indicates that the X-ray variability process is probably the same in all accreting objects, irrespective of the mass of the compact object. We plan to investigate this issue further in the near future.

  We present a UV to millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 16 hyperluminous, dust-obscured quasars at z $\sim$ 3, selected by the \textit{Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer}. We aim to investigate the physical properties of these quasars, with a focus on their molecular gas content. We decompose the SEDs into three components: stellar, cold dust, and active galactic nucleus (AGN). By doing so, we are able to derive and analyze the relevant properties of each component. We determine the molecular gas mass from CO line emission based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. By including ALMA observations in the multiwavelength SED analysis, we derive the molecular gas fractions, gas depletion timescales, and star formation efficiencies (SFEs). Their sample median and 16th-84th quartile ranges are $f_{\rm gas}\,\sim\,0.33_{-0.17}^{+0.33}$, $t_{\rm depl}\,\sim$ 39$_{-28}^{+85}$ Myr, SFE $\sim\,$ 297$_{-195}^{+659}$ $\rm K\,\rm km\,\rm s^{-1}\,\rm pc^{-2}$. Compared to main-sequence galaxies, they have a lower molecular gas content and higher SFEs, similar to quasars in the literature. This suggests that the gas in these quasars is rapidly depleted, likely as the result of intense starburst activity and AGN feedback. The observed correlations between these properties and the AGN luminosities further support this scenario. Additionally, we infer the black hole to stellar mass ratio and black hole mass growth rate, which indicate a significant central black hole mass assembly over short timescales. Our results are consistent with the scenario that our sample represents a short transition phase toward unobscured quasars.

  Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) can strongly impact the host galaxies by driving high-velocity winds that impart substantial energy and momentum to the interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we study the impact of these winds in isolated galaxies using high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations. Our simulations use the explicit ISM and stellar evolution model called Stars and MUltiphase Gas in GaLaxiEs (SMUGGLE). Additionally, using a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme, we resolve AGN feedback coupling to the ISM at $\sim$10-100 pc scales. We find that AGN feedback efficiently regulates the growth of SMBHs. However, its effect on star formation and outflows depends strongly on the relative strengths of AGN vs local stellar feedback and the geometrical structure of the gas disk. When the energy injected by AGN is subdominant to that of stellar feedback, there are no significant changes in the star formation rates or mass outflow rates of the host galaxy. Conversely, when the energy budget is dominated by the AGN, we see a significant decline in the star formation rates accompanied by an increase in outflows. Galaxies with thin gas disks like the Milky Way allow feedback to escape easily into the polar directions without doing much work on the ISM. In contrast, galaxies with thick and diffuse gas disks confine the initial expansion of the feedback bubble within the disk, resulting in more work done on the ISM. Phase space analysis indicates that outflows primarily comprise hot and diffuse gas, with a lack of cold and dense gas.
