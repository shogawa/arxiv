  [abridged] 1H 0419-577 is a highly-accreting, luminous BLS1 AGN. This study aims to characterise its disc-corona system using, for the first time, simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations, performed in May and November 2018. We conducted high-resolution grating spectroscopy to identify potential soft X-ray absorption and emission features. To measure the hot corona temperatures from the spectral analysis above 3 keV, we also included data from a previous NuSTAR observation from June 2015. We characterised the disc-corona system properties by analysing the broadband spectra and the SED from UV to hard X-rays. 1H 0419-577 was observed in a bare-like high-flux state at both epochs, with negligible neutral and ionised absorption along its line of sight at both Galactic and AGN rest-frames. However, several soft X-ray emission lines were detected, notably a broad and intense OVII line indicating an accretion disc origin at only a few tens of gravitational radii. The broadband X-ray spectra revealed a prominent, absorption-free smooth soft X-ray excess, a weak Fe Kalpha complex, and a lack of a Compton hump. Fitting data above 3 keV yielded apparent moderate hot corona temperatures of ~20-30 keV for the 2018 and 2015 observations, depending on the model applied. The 2018 X-ray broadband spectra were well reproduced by either a relativistic reflection model with a high-density accretion disc (~10^18 cm^-2), or a hybrid model combining warm and hot coronae with relativistic reflection. We performed the SED analysis for the latter scenario, which indicated that both the hot and warm coronae would have a small spatial extent. Both scenarios can successfully reproduce the two 2018 observations of 1H 0419-577, but they imply very different physical conditions, for example, in terms of disc density, temperature and accretion power released in the hot corona and the origin of the UV emission.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.

  The persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20121102A, the first precisely localized repeating fast radio burst (FRB), provides key constraints on both its local environment and the nature of the underlying FRB engine. We present a seven-year (2016-2023) temporal analysis of the PRS, combining new uGMRT observations with archival data across L-band frequencies. We find no statistically significant long-term trend in its L-band flux density. The observed variability is consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation, and the data do not require the PRS to be a source exhibiting strong intrinsic variability. This stability challenges models predicting rapid fading from evolving magnetized outflows, such as those powered by young magnetars or relativistic shocks. Our low-frequency observations show no evidence for spectral evolution between 1.4 GHz and 745 MHz, with a measured spectral index of $\alpha = -0.15 \pm 0.08$, in agreement with values reported from earlier observations in 2016-2017. The PRS remains compact, exhibits a flat radio spectrum, and-if powered by an intermediate-mass black hole accreting at a low Eddington ratio-its radio and X-ray properties are broadly consistent with the fundamental plane of radio-loud AGNs. While not conclusive, this scenario represents a viable alternative to magnetar wind nebula models and warrants further investigation. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant correlation between FRB burst activity and the luminosity of associated PRSs among repeating sources. This apparent decoupling challenges simple progenitor models that directly link bursts and persistent emission. Together, these results suggest that the FRB engine and PRS may in some systems originate from physically distinct sources, underscoring the need for flexible models to explain the diverse environments of repeating FRBs.

  Based on a unified description of various accretion flows, we find a long-ignored solution - the effectively optically thin accretion flow, occurring at accretion rates around Eddington value. As a consequence of radiation-pressure dominance, the density in a standard thin disc (SSD) decreases with the increase of accretion rates, making the innermost region effectively optically thin. Further increase in accretion rate leads to a rise of the temperature so that the Compton cooling is able to balance the accretion released energy. We demonstrate that the effectively optically thin flow is characterized by moderate temperature and large scattering optical depth, producing a multi-color Wien spectrum. For an appropriate accretion rate, the accretion flow transforms from an outer SSD to an inner effectively optically thin flow. Thus, the spectra of the whole accretion flow exhibit two components, i.e., a multi-color Wien spectrum at higher frequency and a multi-color blackbody, the former could provide an alternative origin of soft X-ray excess or formation of warm corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our stability analysis proves it is thermally stable and viscously unstable, indicating its existence in accreting systems. We show that effectively optically thin accretion flow exists in supermassive black holes for accretion rates around 0.1 to 10 times Eddington value, bridging the SSD at low accretion rates and slim disc at high rates. By comparing the predictions and average spectra of AGN, we constrain the viscosity parameter to be $\alpha \sim 0.03$, in good agreement with that derived from observed variability.

  We present the DeepDive program, in which we obtained deep ($1-3$ hours) JWST/NIRSpec G235M/F170LP spectra for 10 primary massive ($\log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}=10.8-11.5$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim3-4$. A novel reduction procedure extends the nominal wavelength coverage of G235M beyond H$\alpha$ and [NII] at $z\sim4$, revealing weak, narrow H$\alpha$ lines indicative of low star formation rates (${\rm SFR}\sim0-5\, M_\odot\, {\rm yr^{-1}}$). Two out of 10 primary targets have broad H$\alpha$ lines, indicating the presence of AGNs. We also conduct an archival search of quiescent galaxies observed with NIRSpec gratings in the DAWN JWST Archive, which provides a statistical context for interpreting the DeepDive targets. This archival search provides a spectroscopic sample of 140 quiescent galaxies spanning $1&lt;z&lt;5$ and covering more than an order of magnitude in stellar mass. We revisit the selection of quiescent galaxies based on rest-frame $UVJ$ colors, specific star formation rates, and the detection of the 4000\r{A} spectral break, finding $\sim90\%$ overlap between these criteria. The sample of a total of 150 quiescent galaxies constructed in this study shows that those at $z\sim3-5$, including the DeepDive targets, typically exhibit weaker 4000\r{A} breaks and bluer colors than their lower-redshift counterparts, indicating generally younger stellar populations. Stacked spectra of sources grouped by the $D_n4000$ index reveal faint Iron and Magnesium absorption line features in the stellar continuum even for the low $D_n4000$ ($D_n4000&lt;1.35$) subsample at high redshift ($z\sim3$). In addition, higher $D_n4000$ subsamples show fainter nebular emission lines. These results demonstrate that medium-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy is essential for robustly characterizing the diversity and evolution of early quiescent galaxies. All data from this study will be made publicly available.

  We present spatially-resolved rest-frame optical emission line maps of four galaxies at $z \sim 2$ observed with Keck/OSIRIS to study the physical conditions of the ISM at Cosmic Noon. Our analysis of strong emission line ratios in these galaxies reveals an offset from the local star-forming locus on the BPT diagram, but agrees with other star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. Despite the offset towards higher [O III]$\lambda5008$/H$\beta$ and [N II]$\lambda6585$/H$\alpha$, these strong-line ratios remain consistent with or below the maximum starburst threshold even in the inner $\sim 1$ kpc region of the galaxies, providing no compelling evidence for central AGN activity. The galaxies also exhibit flat radial gas-phase metallicity gradients, consistent with previous studies of $z \sim 2$ galaxies and suggesting efficient radial mixing possibly driven by strong outflows from intense star formation. Overall, our results reveal the highly star-forming nature of these galaxies, with the potential to launch outflows that flatten metallicity gradients through significant radial gas mixing. Future observations with JWST/NIRSpec are crucial to detect fainter emission lines at higher spatial resolution to further constrain the physical processes and ionization mechanisms that shape the ISM during Cosmic Noon.
