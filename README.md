  Cold gaseous systems play important roles in galaxy evolution by possibly providing fuel to ignite active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and star-formation. In this work, we analyze [CII]$158\rm \mu m$ and continuum observations from ALMA for a sample of four radio AGN at $z \approx 3.5$, focusing on eight associated companion cloud systems discovered within projected distances of tens of kiloparsecs or less. The spatial distribution of these companions indicates that the majority of cold gas is not located at the AGN position, i.e., not in their host galaxies. With the assistance of [CII] at 0.2" resolution, we further confirm the gas-poor nature of the hosts by re-analyzing archival [CI] (a tracer of H$_{2}$) at $\sim2"$ resolution. Our sample has [CII] luminosities in a range of $2.8\times10^{8}&lt;L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\odot}&lt;4.2\times10^{9}$. The $L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\rm IR}$ ratio, $\sim 9.4\times10^{-4}$, is consistent with sources discussed in the literature. Our findings show the gas-poor radio AGN hosts have nearby gas-rich companions. We propose that these companions, which may be stripped clouds in merger process and by interaction with the energy output from the AGN, could also be a trigger of radio-loud AGN. They may also be a signature of negative AGN feedback (e.g., shock heating) on these infalling companions and on the host galaxy. In general, our analysis shows that powerful AGN at and before Cosmic Noon are impacting and being impacted by cold gaseous clouds in their circum-galactic or proto-intracluster media.

  We report multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 2.3 and 8.4GHz of three nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies, identified via mid-infrared spectroscopic analyses as hosting deeply embedded active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Milliarcsecond-scale observations at both frequencies reveal compact continuum emission in IRAS F00188$-$0856 and IRAS F01298$-$0744, accounting for $\sim10$% of the flux density measured on arcsecond scales. The non-detection in IRAS F00091$-$0738 and the lower limit on the intrinsic 8.4 GHz brightness temperature of $10^{6.1}$ K in IRAS F01298$-$0744 yield no conclusive evidence of AGN-driven radio emission, whereas the measurement of $10^{7.8}$ K in IRAS F00188$-$0856 confirms an AGN origin. Thus, the mid-infrared AGN classification remains robust, with at least one object exhibiting compact radio emission indicative of AGN activity. We further investigate the high-frequency spectral steepening observed in all three galaxies. In each case, this steepening arises from spectral aging in diffuse kpc-scale emission, which is resolved out by the VLBA observations. One possible explanation for the steepening of the sample is merger-induced particle acceleration. IRAS F00188$-$0856 exhibits a peaked radio spectrum, characteristic of a young radio source, with the high-frequency steepening attributable to this AGN activity. Consequently, the spectral steepening at high frequencies arises from particles accelerated by merger dynamics or AGN activity.

  Observations of galaxy-cluster cores reveal that AGN feedback is strongly associated with both a short central cooling time ($t_{\rm c} \lesssim 10^9 \, {\rm yr}$) and accumulations of cold gas ($\lesssim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$). Also, the central ratio of cooling time to freefall time is rarely observed to drop below $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$, and large accumulations of cold gas are rarely observed in environments with $t_{\rm c} / t_{\rm ff} \gtrsim 30$. Here we show that the critical range -- $10 \lesssim t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \lesssim 30$ -- plausibly results from magnetized thermal instability. We present numerical simulations of magnetized stratified atmospheres with an initially uniform magnetic field. Thermal instability in an otherwise static atmosphere with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$ progresses to nonlinear amplitudes, causing cooler gas to accumulate, as long as the background ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is $\beta \lesssim 100$. And in atmospheres with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 20$, cooler gas accumulates for $\beta \lesssim 10$. Magnetized atmospheres are therefore much more likely to precipitate than unmagnetized atmospheres with otherwise identical properties. We hypothesize that AGN feedback triggered by accumulations of cold gas prevents $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ from dropping much below 10, because cold gas inevitably precipitates out of magnetized galactic atmospheres with lower ratios, causing $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ to rise.

  We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). For some AGN, the mapping of multiple emission lines allows us to measure the enclosed mass within different radii from the central SMBH, which allows us to infer or constrain the dark matter density profile on sub-pc scales. We find that for five out of fourteen AGN in our identified sample, the observed enclosed mass grows with radii, hinting evidence for the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2 $\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$, consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by stellar heating processes. For the remaining AGN in our sample, we are able to derive upper limits on the dark matter density profile parameters. Interestingly, the strongest evidence for a dark matter component arises from the farthest object considered, 3C 390. This new method allows us to measure or constrain for the first time the dark matter density in the vicinity of extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and nature of dark matter.

  Galaxy mergers play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution, especially by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing the gas around galaxies, triggering AGN activity and star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy merger at $z=1.14$, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting a nearly identical morphology. The grism spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN. A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation, driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a previously underappreciated yet crucial mechanism for efficient gas-to-star conversion and rapid stellar mass assembly in the early Universe.

  The excitation sources in galaxies are frequently mixed due to AGN and stellar feedback, including star formation, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and shock excitation. Disentangling the star formation, AGN, and shocks in galaxy integral-field spectra (IFU) at optical wavelengths is crucial to expanding the galaxy sample for AGN and stellar feedback studies, given the lack of multiwavelength observations for most of the galaxies that are observed in optical wavelengths. Previous methods to address this issue either have a limited application range or are highly uncertain in separating AGN from shock excitation (D'Agostino et al. 2019; Johnston et al. 2023). Here, we propose a theoretical three-dimensional (3D) diagram. This theoretical 3D diagram overcomes the limitations of previous methods and can simultaneously separate star formation, AGNs, and shocks in active galaxies. Along with the separation, the new theoretical 3D diagram also constrains the gas metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure within the galaxy. By applying the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/MUSE IFU data and the Wide Field Spectrograph IFU data for NGC5728 on the theoretical 3D diagram, we find a star-forming ring surrounding the galaxy center with a projected radius of $\sim$1 kpc in the sky plane, an AGN ionized-bicone extended up to $\sim$2 kpc from the nuclear center, and a fast shock dominated disk region at the base of the AGN outflow, which is likely associated with a nuclear accretion disk or a result of jet-ISM interaction. The theoretical 3D diagram opens a new window to study the interplay among star formation, AGN, and shocks in active galaxies.

  We present our study of the XRISM observation of the Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 3783. For the first time, XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter enables a detailed characterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active galactic nucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent velocities, along with their ionization parameter $\xi$ and column density $N_{\rm H}$. The high-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series of Fe absorption lines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe XXVI. At lower energies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also detected. Our spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged Resolve spectrum uncover six outflow components, five of which exhibit relatively narrow absorption lines, with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to 1170 km/s. In addition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is consistent with Fe XXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). This component carries a kinetic luminosity of 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our analysis of the Resolve spectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption lines are intrinsically broader than those of lower ionization species, indicating that the turbulent velocity of the six outflow components (ranging from 0 to 3500 km/s) increases with $\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the $N_{\rm H}$ of the outflows generally declines with $\xi$ up to $\log \xi = 3.2$, but rises beyond this point, suggesting a complex ionization structure. Examination of the absorption profile of the Fe XXV resonance line reveals intriguing similarities to UV absorption lines (Ly$\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we infer that the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support a 'hybrid wind' scenario, in which the outflows have multiple origins and driving mechanisms. We explore various interpretations of our findings within AGN wind models.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are typically identified through their distinctive X-ray or radio emissions, mid-infrared (MIR) colors, or emission lines. However, each method captures different subsets of AGN due to signal-to-noise (SNR) limitations, redshift coverage, and extinction effects, underscoring the necessity for a multi-wavelength approach for comprehensive AGN samples. This study explores the effectiveness of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting as a robust method for AGN identification.   Using {\tt CIGALE} optical-MIR SED fits on DESI Early Data Release galaxies, we compare SED-based AGN selection ({\tt AGNFRAC} $\geq0.1$) with traditional methods including BPT diagrams, WISE colors, X-ray, and radio diagnostics.   SED fitting identifies $\sim 70\%$ of narrow/broad-line AGN and 87\% of WISE-selected AGN. Incorporating high SNR WISE photometry reduces star-forming galaxy contamination from 62\% to 15\%. Initially, $\sim50\%$ of SED-AGN candidates are undetected by standard methods, but additional diagnostics classify $\sim85\%$ of these sources, revealing LINERs and retired galaxies potentially representing evolved systems with weak AGN activity. Further spectroscopic and multi-wavelength analysis will be essential to determine the true AGN nature of these sources.   SED fitting provides complementary AGN identification, unifying multi-wavelength AGN selections. This approach enables more complete -- albeit with some contamination -- AGN samples essential for upcoming large-scale surveys where spectroscopic diagnostics may be limited.

  Current cosmological simulations rely on active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback to quench star formation and match observed stellar mass distributions, but models for AGN feedback are poorly constrained. The circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides a helpful laboratory to study this process, as its metallicity, temperature, and density distributions are directly impacted by AGN. Recent observations from the eROSITA instrument provide constraints on these distributions through measurements of extended soft X-ray emission. Here, we generate synthetic eROSITA observations from the EAGLE and SIMBA cosmological simulations, comparing them against observations of galaxies stacked by stellar mass, halo mass, and star-formation rate. SIMBA outperforms EAGLE in matching observed surface brightness profiles in general, but neither simulation consistently agrees with observations across the full range of galaxy properties we studied. We find that variations in CGM X-ray emission between simulations are driven by density differences at $R \lesssim 0.2 R_{200c} $, and temperature and metallicity changes at larger radii. We directly model predicted contributions from X-ray binaries (XRBs), finding that the hot plasma contributes $\approx$ 20 times more to the CGM X-ray luminosity than XRBs, except at $M_*&lt;10^{11} M_\odot$, where the contamination from XRBs becomes more significant.
