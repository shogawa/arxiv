  Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact sources at $z&gt;5$ discovered through JWST spectroscopy. Their spectra exhibit broad Balmer emission lines ($\gtrsim1000\rm~km~s^{-1}$), alongside absorption features and a pronounced Balmer break -- evidence for a dense, neutral hydrogen medium with the $n=2$ state. When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black hole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their stellar masses, challenging models of early black hole--galaxy co-evolution. However, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the formation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes shaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the $n=2$ state, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson scattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their imprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong deviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden H$\beta$ due to conversion to Pa$\alpha$. While Raman scattering can yield broad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of strong FWHM variations across transitions. Raman scattering of higher Lyman-series emission can produce H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ wing width ratios of $\gtrsim1.28$, agreeing with observations. Thomson scattering can reproduce the observed $\gtrsim1000~\rm km\, s^{-1}$ wings under plausible conditions, e.g., $T_{\rm e} \sim 10^4\rm \, K$ and $N_{\rm e}\sim10^{24}\rm~cm^{-2}$ -- and lead to black hole mass overestimates by factors $\gtrsim10$. Our results provide a framework for interpreting hydrogen lines in LRDs and similar systems.

  We present ground-based, multi-band light curves of the AGN Mrk~509, NGC\,4151, and NGC\,4593 obtained contemporaneously with \sw\, monitoring. We measure cross-correlation lags relative to \sw\, UVW2 (1928~\AA) and test the standard prediction for disk reprocessing, which assumes a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk where continuum interband delays follow the relation \( \tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3} \). For Mrk~509 the 273-d \sw\, campaign gives well-defined lags that increase with wavelength as $\tau(\lambda)\propto\lambda^{2.17\pm0.2}$, steeper than the thin-disk prediction, and the optical lags are a factor of $\sim5$ longer than expected for a simple disk-reprocessing model. This ``disk-size discrepancy'' as well as excess lags in the $u$ and $r$ bands (which include the Balmer continuum and H$\alpha$, respectively) suggest a mix of short lags from the disk and longer lags from nebular continuum originating in the broad-line region. The shorter \sw\, campaigns, 69~d on NGC\,4151 and 22~d on NGC\,4593, yield less well-defined, shorter lags $&lt;2$~d. The NGC\,4593 lags are consistent with $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ but with uncertainties too large for a strong test. For NGC\,4151 the \sw\, lags match $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$, with a small $U$-band excess, but the ground-based lags in the $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands are significantly shorter than the $B$ and $g$ lags, and also shorter than expected from the thin-disk prediction. The interpretation of this unusual lag spectrum is unclear. Overall these results indicate significant diversity in the $\tau-\lambda$ relation across the optical/UV/NIR, which differs from the more homogeneous behavior seen in the \sw\, bands.

  We study a catalogue of over 130 emission-line galaxies with matched near infra-red (NIR) and optical spectra, where we examine the relationship between the respective nuclear activity classifications, diagnosed by the flux ratios of emission lines. We match the standard NIR classification with four different optical classifications. While there is a broad agreement between the two regimes, there are mismatches and overlaps caused either by aperture effects and/or NIR radiation penetrating obscuring dust and "seeing deeper" into the nuclear region, thus exposing AGN activity. We examine the relationship between the equivalent widths (EW) of H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, as well as the ratios [N II]/H$\alpha$ vs. [Fe II]/Pa$\beta$, and find reasonable correlations. We thus propose a new diagnostic (EW of Pa$\beta$ with Fe - WPF) in the NIR (analogous to the WHaN classification), using the [Fe II]/Pa$\beta$ flux ratio and the EW of the Pa$\beta$ line. We show, within the limitations of the catalogue size, that the regions of the standard NIR diagram can be reasonably replicated in this new scheme. This diagnostic has the advantage that only one wavelength range needs to be observed, thus being economical with telescope time.

  GW231123 represents the most massive binary-black-hole merger detected to date, lying firmly within, or even above, the pair-instability mass gap. The component spins are both exceptionally high ($a_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$, $a_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$), which is difficult to explain with repeated mergers. Here we show that the black hole spin vectors are closely aligned with each other while significantly tilted relative to the binary's orbital angular momentum, pointing to a common accretion-driven origin. We examine astrophysical formation channels capable of producing near-equal, high-mass, and mutually aligned spins consistent with GW231123 -- particularly binaries embedded in AGN disks and Pop~III remnants, which grew via coherent misaligned gas accretion. We further argue that other high-mass, high-spin events, e.g., GW190521 may share a similar evolutionary pathway. These findings underscore the critical role of sustained, coherent accretion in shaping the most extreme black hole binaries.

  Deep and wide-field near-infrared (NIR) surveys have recently discovered and confirmed ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&gt;11$) spectroscopically at high redshift. However, most are characterized using only ultraviolet (UV)-to-NIR photometry, offering limited insight into obscured star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In this work, we add ten far-infrared (FIR)-to-radio passbands to the existing UV-to-NIR catalogs for two spectroscopically confirmed UMGs from the MAGAZ3NE survey, COS-DR3-195616 ($z_{\rm spec} = 3.255$) and COS-DR1-209435 ($z_{\rm spec} = 2.481$). Utilizing the full UV-to-radio photometry, we revise our earlier UV-NIR-based interpretation of the nature of these galaxies. While both were previously identified as quiescent, our analysis reveals that 195616 is an unobscured galaxy undergoing quenching, and 209435 is a heavily obscured, actively star-forming UMG. We find that 195616 has already depleted most of its molecular gas and is expected to experience minimal future stellar mass growth. In contrast, 209435 contains a substantial molecular gas reservoir and has a prolonged depletion timescale. It is anticipated to increase 0.34 dex in stellar mass, reaching a stellar mass of $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})$ = 11.72 over the next 0.72 Gyr. We present multi-pronged evidence for AGN activity in both UMGs. Our findings support a scenario where AGN feedback in 195616 may have contributed to gas depletion during quenching, while 209435 continues to form stars despite hosting an obscured AGN, suggesting feedback has not yet suppressed star formation. Our work shows the importance of FIR-to-radio observations for accurately inferring the nature and properties of galaxies at $z\gtrsim3$.

  We present spatially resolved maps of morphology, kinematics, and energetics of warm ionized gas in six powerful radio galaxies at z=3.5-4, using JWST/NIRSpec IFU to quantify jet-driven feedback in the early universe. All sources exhibit broad [OIII] emission-line profiles with W80 (line width) values of 950-2500 km/s across $\sim$10s of kpc, signifying large-scale outflows. The outflowing nebulae are preferentially aligned with the radio jet axis, suggesting jet-driven origin. On average, the regions with the broadest lines and highest velocities are co-spatial with radio lobes or cores, and exhibit the strongest kinetic power. Ionized gas masses associated with the outflows span 1 to 8 $\times 10^{9} \ M_\odot$, with total mass outflow rates of 80-950 Msun/yr and kinetic powers between 10^{43.2} and 10^{45.0} erg/s. The outflow kinetic power corresponds to 0.15%-2% of the AGN bolometric luminosity, sufficient to impact galaxy evolution. However, only $\lesssim 1$\% of the jet mechanical energy couples to the warm ionized gas via outflows, consistent with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations. A large fraction of the jet energy may instead reside in shock-heated hot gas, supported by X-ray detection, or used to thermalize the gas and produce the observed emission-line nebulae. Our results demonstrate that radio jets in massive, gas-rich systems at high-redshift can inject significant kinetic and thermal energy to the surroundings, providing direct evidence for jet-driven feedback operating during the peak epoch of galaxy formation.

  We study the optical variability characteristics of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN catalogue by utilising approximately five years of optical light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. We investigate dependencies of the long-term optical variability amplitudes and timescales on (i) supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, luminosity, and Eddington ratio to explore the influence of accretion disk dynamics and radiative processes; (ii) X-ray properties, such as spectral photon indices and fluxes, to study the effect of high-energy emission mechanisms; and (iii) radio characteristics, such as integrated fluxes and radio loudness, which indicate jet activity. Our findings confirm a positive correlation between the variability time scale and both the SMBH mass and luminosity, suggesting that these physical parameters significantly impact the optical variability timescale. Conversely, no significant dependence is found between optical variability and X-ray properties, indicating that high-energy processes may not substantially influence long-term optical variability. Additionally, a weak anti-correlation between optical variability and radio parameters suggests that jet activity has a negligible effect on causing long-term AGN variability. These results support the hypothesis that long-term optical variability in AGN is primarily governed by thermal emission from the accretion disk. Further investigations with larger samples are essential to refine these correlations and develop robust physical models integrating black hole properties, accretion disk physics, and multi-wavelength radiative transfer.
