  There is still a limited number of high-redshift ($z&gt;3$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) whose jet kinematics have been studied with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Without a dedicated proper motion survey, regularly conducted astrometric VLBI observations of bright radio-emitting AGN with sensitive arrays can be utilized to follow changes in the jets, by means of high-resolution imaging and brightness distribution modeling. Here we present a first-time VLBI jet kinematic study of NVSS~J080518$+$614423 ($z = 3.033$) and NVSS~J165844$-$073918 ($z = 3.742$), two flat-spectrum radio quasars that display milliarcsecond-scale jet morphology. Archival astrometric observations carried out mainly with the Very Long Baseline Array, supplemented by recent data taken with the European VLBI Network, allowed us to monitor changes in their radio structure in the $7.6-8.6$~GHz frequency band, covering almost two decades. By identifying individual jet components at each epoch, we were able to determine the apparent proper motion for multiple features in both sources. Apparent superluminal motions range between $(1-14)\,c$, and are found to be consistent with studies of other high-redshift AGN targets. Using the physical parameters derived from the brightness distribution modeling, we estimate the Doppler-boosting factors ($\delta \approx 11.2$ and $\delta \approx 2.7$), the Lorentz factors ($\Gamma \approx 7.4$ and $\Gamma \approx 36.6$) and the jet viewing angles ($\theta \approx 4\fdg4$ and $\theta \approx 8\fdg0$), for NVSS~J080518$+$614423 and NVSS~J165844$-$073918, respectively. The data revealed a stationary jet component with negligible apparent proper motion in NVSS~J165844$-$073918.

  Effective yields, $y_{\rm eff}$, are defined by fundamental galaxy properties (i.e., stellar mass -$M_{\star}$-, gas mass -$M_{\rm gas}$- and gas-phase metallicity). For a closed-box model, $y_{\rm eff}$ is constant and equivalent to the mass in metals returned to the gas per unit mass locked in long-lived stars. Deviations from such behaviour have been often considered observational signatures of past feedback events. By analysing EAGLE simulations with different feedback models, we evaluate the impact of supernovae (SN) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on $y_{\rm eff}$ at redshift $z=0$. When removing supermassive black holes (BH) and, hence, AGN effects, in simulations, galaxies are located around a plane in the $M_{\star} - M_{\rm gas} - {\rm O/H}$ parameter space (being O/H a proxy for gas metallicity, as usual), with such a plane roughly describing a surface of constant $y_{\rm eff}$. As the ratio between BH mass and $M_{\star}$ increases, galaxies deviate from that plane towards lower $y_{\rm eff}$ as a consequence of AGN feedback. For galaxies not strongly affected by AGN feedback, a stronger SN feedback efficiency generates deviations towards lower $y_{\rm eff}$, while galaxies move towards the opposite side of the plane (i.e., towards higher values of $y_{\rm eff}$) as SN feedback becomes weaker. Star-forming galaxies observed in the Local Universe are located around a similar 3D plane. Our results suggest that the features of the scatter around the observed plane are related to the different feedback histories of galaxies, which might be traced by $y_{\rm eff}$.
