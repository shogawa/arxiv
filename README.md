  Dynamical perturbations from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries can increase the rates of tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, most previous work focuses on TDEs from the heavy black hole in the SMBH binary (SMBHB) system. In this work, we focus on the lighter black holes in SMBHB systems and show that they can experience a similarly dramatic increase in their TDE rate due to perturbations from a more massive companion. While the increase in TDEs around the more massive black hole is mostly due to chaotic orbital perturbations, we find that, around the smaller black hole, the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism is dominant and capable of producing a comparably large number of TDEs. In this instance, the mass derived from the light curve and spectra of TDEs triggered by the lighter SMBH companion are expected to be significant smaller than the SMBH mass estimated from galaxy scaling relations, which are dominated by the more massive companion. This apparent inconsistency can help find SMBHB candidates that are not currently accreting as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and that are at separations too small to be resolved as two distinct sources. TDEs thus provide us with an exciting opportunity to study SMBHB, in particular when they might be detected from galaxies hosting SMBHs that are too massive to disrupt sun-like stars.

  To fully take advantage of the data provided by large-scale structure surveys, we need to quantify the potential impact of baryonic effects, such as feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation, on cosmological observables. In simulations, feedback processes originate on scales that remain unresolved. Therefore, they need to be sourced via subgrid models that contain free parameters. We use machine learning to calibrate the AGN and stellar feedback models for the FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Using Gaussian process emulators trained on Latin hypercubes of 32 smaller-volume simulations, we model how the galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions change as a function of the subgrid parameters. The emulators are then fit to observational data, allowing for the inclusion of potential observational biases. We apply our method to the three different FLAMINGO resolutions, spanning a factor of 64 in particle mass, recovering the observed relations within the respective resolved mass ranges. We also use the emulators, which link changes in subgrid parameters to changes in observables, to find models that skirt or exceed the observationally allowed range for cluster gas fractions and the stellar mass function. Our method enables us to define model variations in terms of the data that they are calibrated to rather than the values of specific subgrid parameters. This approach is useful, because subgrid parameters are typically not directly linked to particular observables, and predictions for a specific observable are influenced by multiple subgrid parameters.

  We present the PRIYA suite of cosmological simulations, based on the code and hydrodynamic model of the ASTRID simulation, and designed for cosmological analyses of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Our simulation suite spans a $9$-dimensional parameter space, including $4$ cosmological parameters and $5$ astrophysical/thermal parameters. We have run $48$ low fidelity simulations with $1536^3$ particles in a $120$ Mpc/h box and $3$ high fidelity simulations with $3072^3$ particles in a $120$ Mpc/h box. All our simulations include a full physics model for galaxy formation, including supernova and AGN feedback, and thus also contain a realistic population of DLAs. We advance on earlier simulations suites by larger particle loads, by incorporating new physical models for patchy hydrogen and helium reionization, and by self-consistently incorporating a model for AGN feedback. We show that patchy helium reionization imprints an excess in the 1D flux power spectrum on large scales, which may allow future measurements of helium reionization bubble sizes. Simulation parameters are chosen based on a Latin hypercube design and a Gaussian process is used to interpolate to arbitrary parameter combinations. We build a multi-fidelity emulator for the 1D flux power spectrum and the mean IGM temperature. We show that our final interpolation error is $&lt; 1\%$ and that our simulations produce a flux power spectrum converged at the percent level for $z=5.4$ - $2.2$. Our simulation suite will be used to interpret Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1D flux power spectra from SDSS and future DESI data releases.

  Accretion disk winds launched close to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are a viable mechanism to provide feedback between the SMBH and the host galaxy. We aim to characterize the X-ray properties of the inner accretion disk wind of the nearby active galactic nucleus (AGN) PG 1126-041, and to study its connection with the ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing wind. We perform spectroscopic analysis of eight XMM-Newton observations of PG 1126-041 taken between 2004 and 2015, using both phenomenological models and the most advanced accretion disk wind models available. For half of the dataset, we can compare the X-ray analysis results with the results of quasi-simultaneous, high-resolution spectroscopic UV observations taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The X-ray spectra of PG 1126-041 are complex and absorbed by ionized material which is highly variable on multiple time scales, sometimes as short as 11 days. Accretion disk wind models can account for most of the X-ray spectral complexity of PG 1126-041, with the addition of massive clumps, represented by a partially covering absorber. Variations in column density ($N_H \sim 5-20 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) of the partially covering absorber drive the observed X-ray spectral variability of PG 1126-041. The absorption from the X-ray partially covering gas and from the blueshifted C IV troughs appear to vary in a coordinated way. The line of sight toward PG 1126-041 offers a privileged view through a highly dynamic nuclear wind originating on inner accretion disk scales, making the source a very promising candidate for future detailed studies of the physics of accretion disk winds around SMBHs.

  We investigate the potential of low-redshift Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) forest for constraining active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback models by analyzing the Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulation at z=0.1. These simulations are ideal for studying the impact of AGN feedback on the intergalactic medium (IGM) as they share initial conditions with significant differences in the feedback prescriptions. Both simulations reveal that the IGM is significantly impacted by AGN feedback. Specifically, feedback is stronger in Illustris and results in reducing cool baryon fraction to 23% relative to 39% in IllustrisTNG. However, when comparing various statistics of Ly$\alpha$ forest such as 2D and marginalized distributions of Doppler widths and H I column density, line density, and flux power spectrum with real data, we find that most of these statistics are largely insensitive to the differences in feedback models. This lack of sensitivity arises because of the fundamental degeneracy between the fraction of cool baryons and the H I photoionization rate ($\Gamma_{\rm HI}$) as their product determines the optical depth of the Ly$\alpha$ forest. Since the $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$ cannot be precisely predicted from first principles, it needs to be treated as a nuisance parameter adjusted to match the observed Ly$\alpha$ line density. After adjusting $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$, the distinctions in the considered statistics essentially fade away. Only the Ly$\alpha$ flux power spectrum at small spatial scales exhibits potentially observable differences, although this may be specific to the relatively extreme feedback model employed in Illustris. Without independent constraints on either $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$ or cool baryon fraction, constraining AGN feedback with low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest will be very challenging.

  Characterising the prevalence and properties of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is key for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and determining their role in cosmic reionization. We perform a spectroscopic search for broad H$\alpha$ emitters at $z\approx4-6$ using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide field slitless spectroscopy from the EIGER and FRESCO surveys. We identify 20 H$\alpha$ lines at $z = 4.2 - 5.5$ that have broad components with line widths from $\sim1200 - 3700$ km s$^{-1}$, contributing $\sim 30 - 90$ % of the total line flux. We interpret these broad components as being powered by accretion onto SMBHs with implied masses $\sim10^{7-8}$ M$_{\odot}$. In the UV luminosity range M$_{\rm UV}$ = -21 to -18, we measure number densities of $\approx10^{-5}$ cMpc$^{-3}$. This is an order of magnitude higher than expected from extrapolating quasar UV luminosity functions. Yet, such AGN are found in only $&lt;1$% of star-forming galaxies at $z\sim5$. The SMBH mass function agrees with large cosmological simulations. In two objects we detect narrow red- and blue-shifted H$\alpha$ absorption indicative, respectively, of dense gas fueling SMBH growth and outflows. We may be witnessing early AGN feedback that will clear dust-free pathways through which more massive blue quasars are seen. We uncover a strong correlation between reddening and the fraction of total galaxy luminosity arising from faint AGN. This implies that early SMBH growth is highly obscured and that faint AGN are only minor contributors to cosmic reionization.

  We study the impact of resonantly scattered X-ray line emission on the observability of the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies. We apply a Monte Carlo radiative transfer post-processing analysis to the high-resolution TNG50 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation. This allows us to model the resonant scattering of OVII(r) X-ray photons within the complex, multi-phase, multi-scale CGM. The resonant transition of the OVII He-like triplet is one of the brightest, and most promising, X-ray emission lines for detecting the hot CGM and measuring its physical properties. We focus on galaxies with stellar masses 10 &lt; log(M*/Msun) &lt; 11 at z ~ 0. After constructing a model for OVII(r) emission from the central galaxy as well as from CGM gas, we forward model these intrinsic photons to derive observable surface brightness maps. We find that scattering significantly boosts the observable OVII(r) surface brightness of the extended and diffuse CGM. This enhancement can be large -- an order of magnitude on average at a distance of 200 projected kpc for high-mass M* = 10^10.7 Msun galaxies. The enhancement is larger for lower mass galaxies, and can even reach a factor of 100, across the extended CGM. Galaxies with higher star formation rates, AGN luminosities, and central OVII(r) luminosities all have larger scattering enhancements, at fixed stellar mass. Our results suggest that next-generation X-ray spectroscopic missions including XRISM, LEM, ATHENA, and HUBS -- which aim to detect the hot CGM in emission -- could specifically target halos with significant enhancements due to resonant scattering.
