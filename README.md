  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled numerous massive black holes (BHs) in faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The discovery highlights the presence of dust-reddened AGN populations, referred to as little red dots (LRDs), more abundant than X-ray selected AGNs, which are less influenced by obscuration. This finding indicates that the cosmic growth rate of BHs within this population does not decrease but rather increases at higher redshifts beyond $z\sim 6$. The BH accretion rate density deduced from their luminosity function is remarkably higher than that from other AGN surveys in X-ray and infrared bands. To align the cumulative mass density accreted to BHs with the observed BH mass density at $z\simeq 4-5$, as derived from the integration of the BH mass function, the radiative efficiency must be doubled from the canonical 10% value, achieving significance beyond the $&gt;2\sigma$ confidence level. This suggests the presence of rapid spins with 96% of the maximum limit among these BHs, maintained by prolonged mass accretion instead of chaotic accretion with randomly oriented inflows. Moreover, we derive an upper bound for the stellar mass of galaxies hosting these LRDs, ensuring consistency with galaxy formation in the standard cosmological model, where the host stellar mass is limited by the available baryonic reservoir. Our analysis gives a lower bound for the BH-to-galaxy mass ratio that exceeds the typical value known in the nearby universe and aligns with that for JWST-detected unobscured AGNs. Accordingly, we propose a hypothesis that the dense, dust-rich environments within LRDs facilitate the emergence of rapidly spinning and overmassive BH populations during the epoch of reionization. This scenario predicts a potential association between relativistic jets and other high-energy phenomena with overmassive BHs in the early universe.

  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at early stage of accretion process, are also found to host relativistic jets. However, currently known jetted NLS1s are rare. The majority of NLS1s are undetected at radio band. The radio detection rate of NLS1s raises with the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), which gives a good opportunity to find more jetted NLS1s. The better sensitivity brings another question of whether the radio emission of NLS1s with low radio luminosity originates from jet activity. In order to clarify the origin of radio emission for NLS1s, and search for more jetted NLS1s, we explore the mid-infrared properties of LoTSS detected NLS1s by comparing them with known jetted AGNs and star forming galaxies (SFGs), which locate above and on the well studied radio/far-infrared correlation, respectively. The majority of NLS1s show mid-infrared (MIR) excess compared with SFGs. Their radio emission shows significant correlation with MIR emission. In MIR color-color diagram, NLS1s are overlapped with flat spectrum radio quasars, but well separated from SFGs and optically selected radio galaxies. The flux ratio between radio and MIR emission of these NLS1s is also similar with a radio quiet quasar with weak jet. These results imply substantial contributions from AGN activities for both radio and MIR emission of NLS1s. A small fraction of NLS1s with relatively higher radio luminosity locate in similar region with blazars in radio-MIR diagram, which suggests that the radio emission of these NLS1s is dominated by jet. We obtain a sample of jetted NLS1 candidates through their radio excess in radio-MIR diagram.

  We selected sources with a steep soft-X-ray-band spectrum with a photon index larger than 2.5 -- measured by eROSITA on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) -- from the eFEDS AGN catalogue as candidates of highly accreting supermassive black holes, and investigated their multi-wavelength properties. Among 601 bright AGN with 0.2-5 keV counts of greater than 100, 83 sources (~14%) are classified as steep-spectrum sources. These sources have typical 0.5-2 keV luminosities of L(SX) ~ 1e44 erg/s and the majority of them are found at redshifts below z=1. In comparison with sources with flatter spectra, these sources have, on average, a UV (or optical) to 2 keV luminosity ratio that is larger by ~0.3 dex and bluer optical-to-UV continuum emission. They also appear to be radio quiet based on the detection rate in the FIRST and VLASS surveys. Their host galaxies -- at least in the redshift range of z=0.2-0.8, where the AGN-galaxy decomposition results from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging are available -- tend to be late-type and have smaller stellar masses than those of sources with flatter spectra. These properties are similar to those found in nearby narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, in agreement with the picture that they are AGN with elevated accretion rates and are in the early growth phase of black hole and galaxy co-evolution. However, the steep-spectrum sources are not exclusively narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies; indeed many are broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, as found by a catalogue search. This suggests that these steep-spectrum sources may be black holes generally with high accretion rates but of a wide mass range, including a few objects emitting at L(SX)&gt;1e45 erg/s, of which black hole masses can be close to 10^9 M_sun.

  Context. An optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole might contribute to broad-line emission in type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, emission line profiles are most often not immediately consistent with the profiles expected from a rotating disk. The extent to which an AD in AGN contributes to the broad Balmer lines and high-ionization UV lines in radio-loud (RL) AGN needs to be investigated. Aims. This work aims to address whether the AD can account for the double-peaked profiles observed in the Balmer lines (H$\beta$, H$\alpha$), near-UV (Mgii$\lambda$2800), and high-ionization UV lines (Civ$\lambda$1549, Ciii]$\lambda$1909) of the extremely jetted quasar 3C 47. Methods. The low ionization lines (LILs) (H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, and Mgii$\lambda$2800) were analyzed using a relativistic Keplerian AD model. Fits were carried out following Bayesian and multicomponent non-linear approaches. The profiles of prototypical high ionization lines (HILs) were also modeled by the contribution of the AD, along with fairly symmetric additional components. Results. The LIL profiles of 3C 47 are in very good agreement with a relativistic Keplerian AD model. The disk emission is constrained between $\approx$ 100 and $\approx$ 10000 gravitational radii, with a viewing angle of $\approx$30 degrees. Conclusions. The study provides convincing direct observational evidence for the presence of an AD and explains the HIL profiles are due to disk and failed wind contributions. The agreement between the observed profiles of the LILs and the model is remarkable. The main alternative, a double broad line region associated with a binary black hole, is found to be less appealing than the disk model for the quasar 3C 47.
