  Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) show the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines in their UV/optical spectra on timescales of months to decades. Here, we investigate how CL transitions depend on several AGN parameters such as accretion rate, obscuration properties and black hole mass. We study a sample of 20 nearby optically-identified CLAGNs from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), using quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray observations taken in the last $\sim 40$ years. We find that for all CLAGNs, the transition is accompanied by a change in Eddington ratio. The CL transitions are not associated with changes in the obscuration properties of the AGN. CLAGNs are found to have a median Eddington ratio lower than the AGNs in the BASS sample in which CL transitions were not detected. The median of the transition Eddington ratio (Eddington ratio at which AGN changes its state) is found to be $\sim 0.01$ for type 1 $\leftrightarrow$ 1.8/1.9/2 transition, which is consistent with the hard $\leftrightarrow$ soft state transition in black hole X-ray binaries. Most CL events are constrained to occur within 3-4 years, which is considerably shorter than the expected viscous timescale in AGN accretion disk. The transitions of the optical CLAGNs studied here are likely associated to state changes in the accretion flow, possibly driven by disk-instability.

  We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of the \Lyalpha emitter CR7 at z ~ 6.6, observed as part of the GA-NIFS program. Using low-resolution PRISM (R ~ 100) data, we confirm a bright \Lyalpha emitter, and a diffuse \Lyalpha halo extending up to 3 kpc from the peak of ionized emission, both of them associated to the most massive, UV bright galaxy in the system (CR7-A). We confirm the presence of two additional UV-bright satellites (CR7-B and CR7-C) detected at projected distances of 6.4 and 5.2 kpc from the primary source. We perform SED fitting of the low-resolution data and revealed an inverted star formation history between two satellites at early epochs and a spatially resolved anti-correlation of the gas-phase metallicity and the star formation rate density, likely driven by the gas exchange among the satellites, favouring the merger scenario for CR7. From the high-resolution G395H (R ~ 2700) data, we discover at least three additional companions mainly traced by the \OIIIL emission line, although they are not detected in continuum. We disentangle the kinematics of the system and reveal extended ionised emission linking the main galaxy and the satellites. We spatially resolve the \OIIIL, \OIII[4363], and \Hgamma emission lines and use a diagnostic diagram tailored to high-z systems to reveal tentative evidence of AGN ionisation across the main galaxy (CR7-A) and the N-E companion (CR7-B). Moreover, we detect an unresolved blue-shifted outflow from one of the satellites and present first evidence for a redshifted outflow from the main galaxy. Finally, we compute resolved electron temperature (T$_e \sim 1.6 \times 10^4$ K) and metallicity maps (log(Z/\zsun) from --0.8 to --0.5), and provide insights on how the physical properties of the system evolved at earlier epochs.

  Axion-photon oscillation effect provides a possible explanation for the presence of very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray signals from distant sources. In this work, we propose a model-dependent method to select possible sources that may give sufficient constraints on the axion parameters. We investigate such effect in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) B2 2234+28A and 3C 454.3 based on data obtained from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and MAGIC U.L. We utilize the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit the axion parameters, yielding a result of $g_{a\gamma}=3.05^{+0.51}_{-0.31} \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for the axion-photon coupling strength and $m_{a}=5.25^{+2.35}_{-2.65} \times 10^{-8} $ eV for the axion mass. We also perform 95\% confidence level (CL) constraints to set an upper limit for $g_{a\gamma}$.

  Context: Understanding galaxy evolution in dense environments, particularly proto-clusters, is crucial for studying mechanisms driving star formation and quenching. Aims: This study examines how two proto-cluster over-densities at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4 impact star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and morphology, focusing on quenched galaxies. Methods: We identified proto-cluster over-densities in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) regions of the VANDELS survey. Using spectral energy distribution analysis, Bayesian methods (BEAGLE and BAGPIPES) helped derive best-fit parameters and U-V and V-J rest-frame colours (UVJ), classifying galaxies as quenched or star-forming based on UVJ diagrams and specific star formation rates (sSFR). TNG300 simulations aided interpretation. Results: Two of 13 proto-cluster over-densities host quenched galaxies with red U-V colours, low sSFR, and properties like massive passive galaxies. These quenched members are redder, older, more massive, and more compact. The highest-density peaks at z=3.55 and z=3.43 have dark matter halo masses consistent with proto-clusters and host AGNs, with five and three AGNs, respectively. Compared to field galaxies, these quenched members are in denser environments. TNG300 simulations suggest proto-clusters with quenched galaxies at high redshift evolve to contain more passive galaxies by z=1. Conclusions: The over-densities host massive quenched galaxies and AGNs in their densest peaks. Simulations reveal that sSFR for passive galaxies in proto-clusters was high at z=6, with median mass growth rates of 96% from z=6 to z=3. Conditions for mass assembly likely involve galaxy interactions and high gas accretion in dense environments. Black hole growth and AGN feedback appear to drive quenching at z=3, aligning with the properties of quenched galaxies observed in our study.

  We characterise the co-evolution of radio-loud AGN and their galaxies by mapping the dependence of radio-loud AGN activity on stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time (out to $z \sim 1.5$). Deep LOFAR radio observations are combined with large galaxy samples to study the incidence of radio-loud AGN across the galaxy population; the AGN are further split into low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). We find that LERG activity occurs over a wide range of SFRs, whereas HERGs are typically found in galaxies with ongoing star formation. The LERGs are then split based on their SFRs relative to the main sequence, across redshift. Within quiescent galaxies, LERG activity shows a steep stellar mass dependence with the same normalisation across the past $\sim$ 10 Gyr; this indicates that hot gas fuels LERGs in quiescent galaxies across cosmic time. In massive galaxies ($\log_{10}(M/\rm{M_{\odot}}) \gtrsim 11$), the incidence of LERGs is roughly constant across the galaxy population, suggesting that LERGs in massive galaxies may be fuelled by hot gas regardless of the star-formation activity. At lower masses, however, LERG activity is significantly more enhanced (by a factor of up to 10) in star-forming galaxies compared to quiescent galaxies; this suggests that an additional fuelling mechanism, likely associated with cold gas, may fuel the LERGs in galaxies with higher SFRs. We find that HERGs typically accrete above 1 per cent of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate, and the LERGs typically accrete below this level.

  Over the past decades, a population of galaxies invisible in optical/near-infrared, but bright at longer wavelengths, have been identified through color selections. These so-called optically faint/dark galaxies are considered to be massive quiescent galaxies or highly dust-attenuated galaxies. Having the entire galaxy obscured by dust, however, is likely an extreme case of the much more common occurrence of optically thin and thick absorption coexisting in the same system. With the power of JWST imaging, we are able to spatially resolve massive galaxies at z~3, accurately model their spectral energy distributions, and identify candidate optically thick substructures. We target galaxies with log(M*/Msun)&gt;10.3 and 2.5&lt;z&lt;3.5, and get 486 galaxies in CEERS and PRIMER fields. Based on excess NIR luminosity, we identify 162 galaxies (~33\% of the parent sample) as candidate hosts of optically thick substructures. We then carry out spatially resolved SED modeling to explore the physical properties of those dark substructures and estimate the amount of optically thick obscuration. We find that optically thick dust is ubiquitous in normal massive galaxies with a wide variety of SFR and morphology. 10-20\% of the stellar mass/SFR are unaccounted for in our selected galaxies, and the fraction is insensitive to stellar mass or SFR. The dark substructures are generally dustier than the rest of the galaxies and are irregularly distributed, arguing against an obscured AGN as the source of the NIR excess. A correlation between the obscured luminosity and the presence of a recent starburst in the past &lt;100 Myr is also observed.
