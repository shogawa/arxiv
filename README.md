  We present a study of the cold molecular versus the ionized gas distribution in three nearby Seyfert galaxies: NGC 6860, Mrk 915 and MCG -01-24-012. To constrain the cold molecular flux distribution at $\sim$ 0.5 - 0.8$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$ 150 - 400 pc) scales, we used data from the CO(2-1) emission line, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). For the ionized gas, we used Hubble Space Telescope (HST) narrow-band images, centered on the [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines. Within the inner kiloparsec of the three galaxies, we observe gaps in the CO emission in regions co-spatial with the [O III] flux distribution, similarly to what has been recently observed in other active galaxies. From our original sample of 13 nearby AGN sources, 12 objects present the same trend. This indicates that CO molecules might be partially dissociated by AGN radiation or that there is a deficit of cold molecular gas on nuclear scales driven by ionized gas outflows/jets. If so, this represents a form of AGN feedback that is not captured when only outflow kinematics properties, such as mass outflow rates, are considered. We also discuss that part of the molecular gas might still be present in hotter H$_2$ phases, as observed already in other objects.

  The polar mid-infrared (MIR) emission detected from tens to hundreds of parsecs in some active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been associated with dusty winds driven away by radiation pressure. However, the physical characterization of this extended polar emission remains uncertain. Here we combine $10-21\mu$m JWST/MIRI imaging observations with $7-25 \mu$m MRS integral field spectroscopic observations of 6 nearby, $\bar{D}=35.4\pm4.6$~Mpc, AGN from the GATOS Survey to quantify the nature of the extended MIR emission at $\sim75$ pc resolution at $21~\mu$m. These AGN have similar bolometric luminosities, $\log_{10}(\bar{L}_{\rm{bol}}~[\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}])=44.0\pm0.3$, span a wide range of optical outflow rates, $\dot{M}=0.003-0.21$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, column densities, $\log_{10}(N_{H}^{X-ray} [cm^{-2}])=22.2-24.3$, and Eddington ratios, $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}=0.005-0.06$. We find a poor correlation between the line-only and continuum-only images, indicating that the extended MIR continuum emission is spatially uncorrelated with the warm outflows associated with narrow emission lines in the $10-15\,\mu$m wavelength range. The $75-450$~pc continuum emission has constant dust temperature, $T_{\rm{d}}=132^{+7}_{-7}$ K, and mass, $M_{\rm{d}}=728^{+29}_{-27}$ M$_{\odot}$. Using the conditions of energy balance between radiation pressure and gravity, we find that our AGN sample is in the gravitationally bounded regime, consistent with the lack of detection of dusty winds in our observations. At $10~\mu$m, the level of line emission contribution across the NLR is correlated with the outflow kinetic energy and mass outflow rates. We find no correlation with the AGN properties. These results indicate that the radio jet may be triggering the gas outflow and line emission, while the extended dust emission is distributed in molecular clouds and/or shocked regions across the narrow line region.   

Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Cool Cores: An Inverse-Compton Origin for
  Cool Core Cluster Emission

  X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for &gt;Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.

  In this work, we aim to further populate the low-mass regime of black hole (BH) scaling relations to better understand the formation and growth mechanisms of central supermassive BHs. We target six galaxies that have been previously identified as hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on optical spectroscopy from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with stellar masses reported to be M$_\star &lt; 5 \times 10^9$ M$_\odot$. Using follow-up optical spectroscopy from the Magellan Echellette Spectrograph (MagE), we extract galaxy velocity dispersions ($\sigma_\star$) and estimate virial BH masses from broad H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the galaxies in our sample do not deviate significantly from either the M$_{BH}-\sigma_\star$ or M$_{BH}-$M$_{\star}$ scaling relations defined by higher mass galaxies. Additionally, we identify one galaxy with triple-peaked SII, NII, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. This spectral shape is not shared by OIII and, in fact, the OIII line appears to have distinct kinematics from the other emission lines. Incorporating the spatial distribution of the various emission lines, we find that the galaxy spectrum is consistent with a prominent central AGN driving an outflow, surrounded by an extended ring/disk of gas predominantly ionized by shocks and/or star formation. This work has implications for the demographics of BHs in low-mass galaxies and the role of AGN feedback.
