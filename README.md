Recent studies have revealed that bars can form as early as a few billion years after the Big Bang, already displaying similar characteristics of evolved bars in the Local Universe. Bars redistribute angular momentum across the galaxy, regulating star formation, AGN activity, and building new stellar structures such as nuclear discs. However, the effects of bar-driven evolution on young galaxies are not yet known, as no evidence of bar-built stellar structures has ever been found beyond $z = 1$, until now. In this work, we show evidence of a bar-built, star-forming nuclear disc, already present at redshift $z = 1.5$. This is the first evidence of a bar-built stellar structure at Cosmic Noon. We find that this nuclear disc is actively forming stars and has the same size as some nuclear discs in nearby galaxies. This evidence solidifies the now emerging picture in which bars are fundamental not only in the late evolution of galaxies, but also in their early evolutionary stages. It changes the current paradigm by urging a revision of our picture of galaxy evolution beyond redshift one, to include new considerations on the role played by bars as early as a few billion years after the Big Bang.

Every astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave (GWB) is limited by the amount of rest mass available to be converted into gravitational radiation. Here we derive a population-agnostic scaling law that places an absolute energetic ceiling on stochastic backgrounds across the entire GW frequency spectrum, from nanoHertz to kilohertz. We apply this framework to bound the backgrounds from supermassive black hole binaries, intermediate-mass black hole captures by supermassive black holes in AGN disks, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, binary neutron stars, Population III remnants, and stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that the energetic ceiling for supermassive black hole binaries is $A \leq 1.6^{+0.3}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-15}$ at a reference frequency of $1\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This astrophysical GWB ceiling is within $1σ$ with the GWB amplitude reported by NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA, implying that the current observed signal is consistent with being powered by a population of ultramassive black holes ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^{10}\,M_\odot$). Finally, we demonstrate that the total astrophysical background from all channels combined cannot exceed $Ω_{\rm gw} \sim 10^{-7}$.

We present near- and mid-infrared spectra of eight Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN), spanning nearly four orders of magnitude in black hole mass and Eddington ratio, obtained with JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI as part of the ReveaLLAGN program along with identical archival data of Cen A. The high spatial resolution of JWST cleanly separates AGN emission from host-galaxy contamination, enabling detections of high-ionization potential lines more than an order of magnitude fainter than previously measured. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a transition at log($L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$) ~ -3.5, where the spectral energy distribution becomes increasingly deficient in ultraviolet photons. We find that rotational H$_2$ excitation temperatures are elevated (~500 K higher) compared to both higher-luminosity AGN and star-forming galaxies, while the H$_2$(0-0)S(3)/PAH$_{11.3 μm}$ ratios are consistent with those observed in the AGN population. We discuss the possible roles of outflows, jets, and X-ray dominated regions in shaping the interstellar medium surrounding LLAGN. Silicate emission at ~10 $μ$m, localized to the nuclear region, is detected in most ReveaLLAGN targets. This dataset offers the first comprehensive JWST-based characterization of infrared emission lines in the nuclear regions of LLAGN.
