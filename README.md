  Current models of galaxy formation require strong feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to explain the observed lack of star formation in massive galaxies since z~2 but direct evidence of this energy input is limited. We use the SIMBA cosmological galaxy formation simulations to assess the ability of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) measurements to provide such evidence, by mapping the pressure structure of the circumgalactic medium around massive z~0.2-1.5 galaxies. We undertake a stacking approach to calculate the total tSZ signal and its radial profile in simulations with varying assumptions of AGN feedback, and we assess its observability with current and future telescopes. By convolving our predictions with the 2.1' beam of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), we show that current observations at z~1 are consistent with SIMBA's fiducial treatment of AGN feedback, and inconsistent with SIMBA models without feedback. At z~0.5, observational signals lie between SIMBA run with and without AGN feedback, suggesting AGN in SIMBA may inject too much energy at late times. By convolving our data with a 9.5'' beam corresponding to the TolTEC camera on the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano (LMT), we predict a unique profile for AGN feedback that can be distinguished with future higher-resolution measurements. Finally, we explore a novel approach to quantify the non-spherically symmetric features surrounding our galaxies by plotting radial profiles representing the component of the stack with m-fold symmetry.

  We fit the UV/optical lightcurves of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 to produce maps of the accretion disk temperature fluctuations $\delta T$ resolved in time and radius. The $\delta T$ maps are dominated by coherent radial structures that move slowly ($v \ll c$) inwards and outwards, which conflicts with the idea that disk variability is driven only by reverberation. Instead, these slow-moving temperature fluctuations are likely due to variability intrinsic to the disk. We test how modifying the input lightcurves by smoothing and subtracting them changes the resulting $\delta T$ maps and find that most of the temperature fluctuations exist over relatively long timescales ($\sim$100s of days). We show how detrending AGN lightcurves can be used to separate the flux variations driven by the slow-moving temperature fluctuations from those driven by reverberation. We also simulate contamination of the continuum emission from the disk by continuum emission from the broad line region (BLR), which is expected to have spectral features localized in wavelength, such as the Balmer break contaminating the $U$ band. We find that a disk with a smooth temperature profile cannot produce a signal localized in wavelength and that any BLR contamination should appear as residuals in our model lightcurves. Given the observed residuals, we estimate that only $\sim$20% of the variable flux in the $U$ and $u$ lightcurves can be due to BLR contamination. Finally, we discus how these maps not only describe the data, but can make predictions about other aspects of AGN variability.

  We use the SIMBA suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the importance of various stellar and AGN feedback mechanisms in partitioning the cosmic baryons between the intergalactic (IGM) and circumgalactic (CGM) media in the $z\leq 1$ Universe. We identify the AGN jets as the most prominent mechanism for the redistribution of baryons between the CGM and large-scale IGM. In contrast to the full feedback models, deactivating AGN jets results in $\approx15-20$ per cent drop in fraction of baryons that reside in the IGM and a consequent increase of baryon fraction in the CGM by $\approx 50$ per cent. Additionally, we find that stellar feedback mechanisms modify the baryon partition between IGM and CGM on a $10$ per cent level. We further examine the physical properties of simulated haloes in different mass bins, and their response to various feedback models. On average, a sixfold decrease in the CGM mass fraction due to the inclusion of feedback from AGN-driven jets is detected in $10^{12}M_{\odot} \leq M_{\rm 200} \leq 10^{14}M_{\odot}$ haloes. Examination of the average radial gas density profiles of $M_{200} &gt; 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ haloes reveals up to an order of magnitude decrease in gas densities due to the AGN jet feedback. We compare gas density profiles from SIMBA simulations to the predictions of the analytical modified NFW model, and show that the latter provides a reasonable approximation of the gas radial profiles within the virial radii of the full range of halo masses when rescaled by the CGM fraction of the halo. The relative partitioning of cosmic baryons and, subsequently, the feedback models can be constrained observationally with fast radio bursts (FRBs) in upcoming surveys.

  With the observation of gravitational waves from merging compact binary systems, a new observing window of the universe has been opened. Most of the gravitational wave events currently detected are due to the merger of binary black hole systems. One way to better investigate such systems is to look for coincident emission in electromagnetic waves or neutrinos. For typical models of isolated binaries, no such emission is expected. However, one promising class of mergers is that of binary black holes in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei. Such mergers potentially occur at high rates, since these environments naturally have high numbers of black holes, which can efficiently form binaries, merge rapidly, and potentially accrete matter fast due to the surrounding gas. Here, we propose a method to search for coincident gravitational wave and neutrino emission from the location of known AGN, using an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis, and apply it to currently available public data.

  We report a discovery of a large-scale bent radio jet in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 514 ($z = 0.071$). The radio emission originates from the two radio lobes of the AGN located near the center of the southern subcluster and extends towards the southern outskirts with multiple bends. Its peculiar morphology is characterized by a $400$-kpc ``bridge'', a $300$-kpc ``arc'', and a $400$-kpc ``tail'', which together contribute to its largest linear size of $\sim0.7$ Mpc. We find that both the flux and spectral features of the emission change with the distance from the AGN. Also, the ``bridge'' presents a $60\%$ polarized radio emission, which coincided with an X-ray cold front. Based on our multi-wavelength observations, we propose that A514 presents a clear case for the redistribution of an old AGN plasma due to merger-driven gas motions. We support our interpretation with idealized cluster merger simulations employing a passive tracer field to represent cosmic-ray electrons and find that merger-driven motions can efficiently create a cloud of these particles in the cluster outskirts, which later can be re-accelerated by the cluster merger shock and produce radio relics.

  We present relativistic magnetohydrodynamic modelling of jets running into hydrostatic, spherically symmetric cluster atmospheres. For the first time in a numerical simulation, we present model cluster atmospheres based upon the Universal Pressure Profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature profile for a typical self-similar atmosphere described by only one parameter - $M_{500}$. We explore a comprehensive range of realistic atmospheres and jet powers and derive dynamic, energetic and polarimetric data which provide insight into what we should expect of future high-resolution studies of AGN outflows. From the simulated synchrotron emission maps which include Doppler beaming we find sidedness distributions that agree well with observations. We replicated a number of findings from our previous work, such as higher power jets inflating larger aspect-ratio lobes and the cluster environment impacting the distribution of energy between the lobe and shocked regions. Comparing UPP and $\beta$-profiles we find that the cluster model chosen results in a different morphology for the resultant lobes with the UPP more able to clear lobe material from the core; and that these different atmospheres influence the ratio between the various forms of energy in the fully developed lobes. This work also highlights the key role played by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities in the formation of realistic lobe aspect-ratios. Our simulations point to the need for additional lobe-widening mechanisms at high jet powers, for example jet precession. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster atmosphere, these numerical simulations represent the most realistic models yet for spherically symmetric atmospheres.

  Stars embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks or captured by them may scatter onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH), leading to a tidal disruption event (TDE). Using the moving-mesh hydrodynamics simulations with {\small AREPO}, we investigate the dependence of debris properties in in-plane TDEs in AGN disks on the disk density and the orientation of stellar orbits relative to the disk gas (pro- and retro-grade). Key findings are: 1) Debris experiences continuous perturbations from the disk gas, which can result in significant and continuous changes in debris energy and angular momentum compared to `naked' TDEs. 2) Above a critical density of a disk around a SMBH with mass $M_{\bullet}$ ($\rho_{\rm crit} \sim 10^{-8}{\rm g~cm^{-3}}(M_{\bullet}/10^{6}{\rm M}_{\odot})^{-2.5}$) for retrograde stars, both bound and unbound debris is fully mixed into the disk. The density threshold for no bound debris return, inhibiting the accretion component of TDEs, is $\rho_{\rm crit,bound} \sim 10^{-9}{\rm g~cm^{-3}}(M_{\bullet}/10^{6}{\rm M}_{\odot})^{-2.5}$. 3) Observationally, AGN-TDEs transition from resembling naked TDEs in the limit of $\rho_{\rm disk}\lesssim 10^{-2}\rho_{\rm crit,bound}$ to fully muffled TDEs with associated inner disk state changes at $\rho_{\rm disk}\gtrsim\rho_{\rm crit,bound}$, with a superposition of AGN+TDE in between. Stellar or remnant passages themselves can significantly perturb the inner disk. This can lead to an immediate X-ray signature and optically detectable inner disk state changes, potentially contributing to the changing-look AGN phenomenon. 4) Debris mixing can enriches the average disk metallicity over time if the star's metallicity exceeds that of the disk gas.

  Aims: To investigate the characteristics of the bar and inner disk in the collisional ring galaxy Cartwheel. Methods: We used the Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations with Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to investigate the stellar kinematics, age, and nature of ionised gas in the inner region of the Cartwheel. We produced the stellar line of sight (LOS) velocity (V), velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), h$_3$ velocity moment, stellar population age, and emission-line maps of the galaxy using the Galaxy IFU Spectroscopy Tool (GIST) pipeline. Results: The observed nature of intensity, V, and $\sigma$ profiles altogether support the existence of a stellar bar as earlier revealed from near-infrared (NIR) $K_s$ band imaging. A weak correlation between V/$\sigma$ and h$_3$ is found within the bar radius, providing more kinematic evidence for a stellar bar which survived the drop-through collision. The overall weak anti-correlation between V/$\sigma$ and h$_3$ in the disk implies that the stellar orbits in the disk are less stable, which might be due to the impact of the collision. The mass-weighted age map of the galaxy shows that the stellar populations in the bar region are relatively older, with an increasing gradient from the bar edge to the centre, another evidence to signify that the bar was present before the galaxy underwent collision. We do not find an active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the BPT analysis of a central unresolved source reported earlier using NIR imaging. Our findings provide the preservation of the pre-collisional structures in the inner region of the Cartwheel, an important input to understanding the evolution of collisional galaxy systems, particularly investigating the pre-collisional central region for theoretical studies.

  We measure velocity offsets in the NaI $\lambda\lambda5890, 5896$ (Na D) interstellar medium absorption lines to track how neutral galactic winds change as their host galaxies evolve. Our sample of $\sim$80,000 SDSS spectra at $0.010 &lt; z &lt; 0.325$ includes starburst, post-starburst, and quiescent galaxies, forming an evolutionary sequence of declining star formation rate (SFR). We detect bulk flows across this sequence, mostly at higher host stellar masses($log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&gt;10$). Along this sequence, the fraction of outflows decreases ($76\pm2\%$ to $65\pm4\%$ to a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $34\%$), and the mean velocity offset changes from outflowing to inflowing ($-84.6\pm5.9$ to $-71.6\pm11.4$ to $76.6\pm2.3\,km\,s^{-1}$). Even within the post-starburst sample, wind speed decreases with time elapsed since the starburst ended. These results reveal that outflows diminish as galaxies age. For post-starbursts, there is evidence for an AGN contribution, especially to the speediest outflows: 1) SFR declines faster in time than outflow velocity, a decoupling arguing against massive stellar feedback; 2) of the few outflows strong enough to escape the interstellar medium (9/105), three of the four hosts with measured emission lines are Seyfert galaxies. For disky starburst galaxies, however, the trends suggest flows out of the stellar disk plane (with outflow 1/2-opening angle $&gt; 45$ degree) instead of from the nucleus: the wind velocity decreases as the disk becomes more edge-on, and the outflow fraction, constant at $\sim$90$\%$ for disk inclinations $i&lt;45$ degree, steadily decreases from $\sim$90$%$ to 20$\%$ for $i&gt;45$ degree.

  We present a sample of 99 dwarf galaxies ($M_*&lt;10^{9.5} M_\odot$) with X-ray activity in their central regions. The sample was obtained from a match of the SRG/eROSITA X-ray point source catalogue in the Eastern Galactic hemisphere with the MPA-JHU SDSS catalogue. The obtained matches were cleaned rigorously with the help of external optical catalogues to increase the purity of the sample. This work is the largest study of this kind -- X-ray activity in $\approx 85$ per cent of matched dwarfs was not reported before. From their position on the BPT diagram, the majority of X-ray active dwarfs are identified as star-forming galaxies. However, for 82 objects their X-ray luminosity cannot be explained by collective emission of X-ray binaries, rendering them strong candidates for dwarf galaxies with an active accreting black hole in their centre. We find that the fraction of AGN among dwarf galaxies drops from $\sim 2\cdot 10^{-2}$ at $L_X\sim 10^{39}$ erg/s to $\sim (2-4)\cdot 10^{-4}$ at $L_X\sim 10^{41}$ erg/s and increases with the stellar mass of the host galaxy. We serendipitously discovered sources with unexpected properties. We report on a tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate in a dwarf galaxy, a massive black hole in a dwarf galaxy with a soft thermal spectrum, a luminous dwarf galaxy with an obscured X-ray spectrum and a few other peculiar sources. Among the eROSITA/MPA-JHU matches rejected in the cleaning procedure, we found three Ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) candidates and a sample of X-ray bright galaxy pairs, in four of which both members shine in X-rays.

  We discuss the origin of a very unusual spectral structure observed in the Fe-K band of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk 1513, a local ($z$=0.063) active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is efficiently accreting matter onto its central supermassive black hole ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}\sim$0.5). We consider the highest quality X-ray observation of this source available to date, performed in 2003 by XMM-Newton. The hard X-ray spectrum is characterised by a remarkable spectral drop at $\sim$7 keV, which can be interpreted as either the onset of a broad absorption trough or the blue wing of a relativistic emission line. Overall, this complex feature is significant at &gt;5$\sigma$, and it is qualitatively reminiscent of a P-Cygni profile. A serendipitous spectrum of lower quality taken by XMM-Newton in 2015 qualitatively confirms the presence of similar Fe-K structures. Although it is not possible to distinguish between the two physical scenarios on sheer statistical grounds with the current data, several considerations lend weight to the possibility that Mrk 1513 is actually hosting a persistent outflow at accretion-disc scales, thus adding to the handful of known AGN in which a wide-angle X-ray wind has been identified so far.   

Changing-Look AGN Behaviour Induced by Disk-Captured Tidal Disruption

  Recent observations of changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGN) hint at a frequency of accretion activity not fully explained by tidal disruption events (TDEs) stemming from relaxation processes in nucleus star clusters (NSCs), traditionally estimated to occur at rates of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy. In this letter, we propose an enhanced TDE rate through the AGN disk capture process, presenting a viable explanation for the frequent transitions observed in changing-look AGN. Specifically, we investigate the interaction between the accretion disk and retrograde stars within NSCs, resulting in the rapid occurrence of TDEs within a condensed time frame. Through detailed calculations, we derive the time-dependent TDE rates for both relaxation-induced TDE and disk-captured TDE. Our analysis reveals that TDEs triggered by the disk capture process can notably amplify the TDE rate by several orders of magnitude during the AGN phase. This mechanism offers a potential explanation for the enhanced high-energy variability characteristic of changing-look AGNs.   

Tidal Disruption Events from three-body scatterings in the disks of
  Active Galactic Nuclei

  Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are routinely observed in quiescent galaxies, as stars from the nuclear star cluster are scattered into the loss cone of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). TDEs are also expected to occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), due to scattering or orbital eccentricity pumping of stars embedded in the AGN accretion disk. Encounters with embedded stellar-mass black holes (BH) can result in AGN $\mu$TDEs. AGN TDEs and $\mu$TDEs could therefore account for a fraction of observed AGN variability. Here, by performing scattering experiments with the few-body code SpaceHub, we compute the probability of AGN TDEs and $\mu$TDEs as a result of 3-body interactions between stars and binary BH. We find that AGN TDEs are more probable during the early life of the AGNs, when rates are $\sim 0.006-0.17\rm{AGN}^{-1}$~yr$^{-1}$, significantly higher than in quiescent galactic nuclei. By contrast, $\mu$TDEs should occur throughout the AGN lifetime at a rate of $\sim 7\times 10^{-7} - 2\times 10^{-5}$~yr$^{-1}$. Detection and characterization of AGN TDEs and $\mu$ AGN TDEs with future surveys using Rubin and Roman will help constrain the populations of stars \&amp; compact objects embedded in AGN disks, a key input for the LIGO/Virgo AGN channel.
