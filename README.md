  We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) neutral carbon, [C I](1-0), line observations that probe molecular hydrogen gas (H$_2$) within seven radio galaxies at $z = 2.9 - 4.5$ surrounded by extended ($\gtrsim100$ kpc) Ly-$\alpha$ nebulae. We extract [C I](1-0) emission from the radio-active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies whose positions are set by near-infrared detections and radio detections of the cores. Additionally, we place constraints on the galaxies' systemic redshifts via He II $\lambda$1640 lines seen with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We detect faint [C I] emission in four out of seven sources. In two of these galaxies, we discover narrow line emission of full width at half maximum $\lesssim100$ km s$^{-1}$ which may trace emission from bright kpc-scale gas clouds within the ISM. In the other two [C I]-detected galaxies, line dispersions range from $\sim100 - 600$ km s$^{-1}$ and may be tracing the rotational component of the cold gas. Overall, the [C I] line luminosities correspond to H$_2$ masses of M$_{\rm H_2,[C I]} \simeq (0.5 - 3) \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ for the detections and M$_{H_2,[C I]} &lt; 0.65 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ for the [C I] non-detections in three out of seven galaxies within the sample. The molecular gas masses in our sample are relatively low in comparison to previously reported measures for similar galaxies which are M$_{H_2,[C I]} \simeq (3 - 4) \times 10^{10}.$ Our results imply that the observed faintness in carbon emission is representative of a decline in molecular gas supply from previous star-formation epochs and/or a displacement of molecular gas from the ISM due to jet-powered outflows.

  We present the first systematic search for UV signatures from radio source-driven AGN feedback in Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio galaxies. Owing to their characteristic sub-galactic jets (1-20 kpc projected linear sizes), CSS hosts are excellent laboratories for probing galaxy scale feedback via jet-triggered star formation. The sample consists of 7 powerful CSS galaxies, and 2 galaxies host to radio sources &gt;20 kpc as control, at low to intermediate redshifts (z&lt;0.6). Our new HST images show extended UV continuum emission in 6/7 CSS galaxies; with 5 CSS hosts exhibiting UV knots co-spatial and aligned along the radio-jet axis. Young (&lt;10 Myr), massive (&gt;5 M$_\odot$) stellar populations are likely to be the dominant source of the blue excess emission in radio galaxies at these redshifts. Hence, the radio-aligned UV regions could be attributed to jet-induced starbursts. Lower near-UV SFRs compared to other indicators suggests low scattered AGN light contribution to the observed UV. Dust attenuation of UV emission appears unlikely from high internal extinction correction estimates in most sources. Comparison with evolutionary synthesis models shows that our observations are consistent with recent (~1-8 Myr old) star forming activity likely triggered by current or an earlier episode of radio emission, or by a confined radio source that has frustrated growth due to a dense environment. While follow-up spectroscopic and polarized light observations are needed to constrain the activity-related components in the observed UV, the detection of jet-induced star formation is a confirmation of an important prediction of the jet feedback paradigm.

  The ultra-luminous X-ray source CXO~J133815.6+043255 is a strong candidate for a bona-fide intermediate mass black hole, residing in the outskirts of NGC~5252. We present 22~GHz radio observations of this source obtained serendipitously in an ongoing high-frequency imaging survey of radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and use this new data point to construct the broad-band radio spectral energy distribution (SED). We find that the SED exhibits a spectral slope of $\alpha=-0.66\pm0.02$, consistent with a steep spectrum from optically-thin synchrotron emission from an unresolved jet. We also find that the $L_R / L_X$ ratio is approximately $10^{-3}$, inconsistent with radio-quiet AGN and many ULXs but consistent with low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) and radio-loud quasars. Together, these observations support the conclusion that CXO~J133815.6+043255 is an intermediate-mass black hole producing a low-mass analog of radio jets seen in classical quasars.
