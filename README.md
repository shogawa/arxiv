  NGC 1068 is a nearby widely studied Seyfert II galaxy presenting radio, infrared, X- and $\gamma$-ray emission as well as strong evidence for high-energy neutrino emission. Recently, the evidence for neutrino emission could be explained in a multimessenger model in which the neutrinos originate from the corona of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). In this environment $\gamma$-rays are strongly absorbed, so that an additional contribution from e.g. the circumnuclear starburst ring is necessary. In this work, we discuss whether the radio jet can be an alternative source of the $\gamma$-rays between about $0.1$ and $100$ GeV as observed by Fermi-LAT. In particular, we include both leptonic and hadronic processes, i.e. accounting for inverse Compton emission and signatures from $pp$ as well as $p\gamma$ interactions. In order to constrain our calculations, we use VLBA and ALMA observations of the radio knot structures, which are spatially resolved at different distances from the supermassive black hole. Our results show that the best leptonic scenario for the prediction of the Fermi-LAT data is provided by the radio knot closest to the central engine. For that a magnetic field strength $\sim 1\,\text{mG}$ is needed as well as a strong spectral softening of the relativistic electron distribution at $(1-10)\,\text{GeV}$. However, we show that neither such a weak magnetic field strength nor such a strong softening is expected for that knot. A possible explanation for the $\sim$ 10 GeV $\gamma$-rays can be provided by hadronic pion production in case of a gas density $\gtrsim 10^4\,\text{cm}^{-3}$. Nonetheless, this process cannot contribute significantly to the low energy end of the Fermi-LAT range. We conclude that the emission sites in the jet are not able to explain the $\gamma$-rays in the whole Fermi-LAT energy band.

  The nearby dwarf galaxy POX 52 at $z = 0.021$ hosts an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a black-hole (BH) mass of $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5-6} M_\odot$ and an Eddington ratio of $\sim$ 0.1-1. This object provides the rare opportunity to study both AGN and host-galaxy properties in a low-mass highly accreting system. To do so, we collected its multi-wavelength data from X-ray to radio. First, we construct a spectral energy distribution, and by fitting it with AGN and host-galaxy components, we constrain AGN-disk and dust-torus components. Then, while considering the AGN-disk emission, we decompose optical HST images. As a result, it is found that a classical bulge component is probably present, and its mass ($M_{\rm bulge}$) is consistent with an expected value from a local relation. Lastly, we analyze new quasi-simultaneous X-ray (0.2-30 keV) data obtained by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton. The X-ray spectrum can be reproduced by multi-color blackbody, warm and hot coronae, and disk and torus reflection components. Based on this, the spin is estimated to be $a_{\rm spin} = 0.998_{-0.814}$, which could suggest that most of the current BH mass was achieved by prolonged mass accretion. Given the presence of the bulge, POX 52 would have undergone a galaxy merger, while the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge}$ relation and the inferred prolonged accretion could suggest that AGN feedback occurred. Regarding the AGN structure, the spectral slope of the hot corona, its relative strength to the bolometric emission, and the torus structure are found to be consistent with Eddington-ratio dependencies found for nearby AGNs.

  We investigate the formation of dense stellar clumps in a suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive, star forming galaxy at $z \sim 2$ under the presence of strong quasar winds. Our simulations include multi-phase ISM physics from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project and a novel implementation of hyper-refined accretion disk winds. We show that powerful quasar winds can have a global negative impact on galaxy growth while in the strongest cases triggering the formation of an off-center clump with stellar mass ${\rm M}_{\star}\sim 10^{7}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$, effective radius ${\rm R}_{\rm 1/2\,\rm Clump}\sim 20\,{\rm pc}$, and surface density $\Sigma_{\star} \sim 10^{4}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$. The clump progenitor gas cloud is originally not star-forming, but strong ram pressure gradients driven by the quasar winds (orders of magnitude stronger than experienced in the absence of winds) lead to rapid compression and subsequent conversion of gas into stars at densities much higher than the average density of star-forming gas. The AGN-triggered star-forming clump reaches ${\rm SFR} \sim 50\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \sim 10^{4}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}\,{\rm kpc}^{-2}$, converting most of the progenitor gas cloud into stars in $\sim$2\,Myr, significantly faster than its initial free-fall time and with stellar feedback unable to stop star formation. In contrast, the same gas cloud in the absence of quasar winds forms stars over a much longer period of time ($\sim$35\,Myr), at lower densities, and losing spatial coherency. The presence of young, ultra-dense, gravitationally bound stellar clumps in recently quenched galaxies could thus indicate local positive feedback acting alongside the strong negative impact of powerful quasar winds, providing a plausible formation scenario for globular clusters.
