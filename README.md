  Relativistic jets originating at the center of AGN are embedded in extreme environments with strong magnetic fields and high particle densities, which makes them a fundamental tool for studying the physics of magnetized plasmas. We aim to investigate the magnetic field structure and the pc/sub-pc properties of the relativistic jet in the radio galaxy 3C111. Rotation Measure (RM) studies of nearby radio galaxies, such as this one, provide a valuable tool to investigate transversal magnetic field properties of the synchrotron emission. We model the brightness distribution of the source with multiple 2D Gaussian components to characterize individual emission features. After determining the core shift, we compute the spectral index maps for all the frequency pairs and find different distributions for the core region and the jet with an unusual optically thick/flat feature at 1-2 pc from the core. Using modelfit, we find a total of 56 components at different frequencies. By putting constraints on the size and position, we identify 22 components at different frequencies for which we compute the equipartition magnetic field. We compute the RM at two different triplets of frequencies. At 15.2-21.9-43.8 GHz, we discover high values of RM in the same region where the optically thick/flat feature was found. This can be associated with high electron density at 1-2 pc from the core that we interpreted as originating in a cloud of the clumpy torus. At 5-8.4-15.2 GHz, we find a distribution of the EVPAs and significant RM transverse gradient that provide strong evidence of a helical configuration of the magnetic field, as found in simulations.

  Recollimation is a phenomenon of particular importance in the dynamic evolution of jets and in the emission of high-energy radiation. Additionally, the full comprehension of this phenomenon provides insights into fundamental properties of jets in the vicinity of the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Three-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations revealed that the jet conditions at recollimation favor the growth of strong instabilities, challenging the traditional view-supported from two-dimensional simulations-of confined jets undergoing a series of recollimation and reflection shocks. To investigate the stability of relativistic jets in AGNs at recollimation sites, we perform a set of long duration three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with the state-of-the-art PLUTO code, to focus on the development of hydrodynamical instabilities. We explore the non-linear growth of the instabilities and their effects on the physical jet properties as a function of the initial jet parameters: jet Lorentz factor, temperature, opening angle and jet-environment density-contrast. The parameter space is designed to describe low-power, weakly magnetized jets at small distances from the core (around the parsec scale). All collimating jets we simulated develop instabilities. Recollimation instabilities decelerate the jet, heat it, entrain external material, and move the recollimation point to shorter distances from the core. This is true for both conical and cylindrical jets. The instabilities, that are first triggered by the centrifugal instability, appear to be less disruptive in the case of narrower, denser, more relativistic, and warmer jets. These results provide valuable insights into the complex processes governing AGN jets and could be used to model the properties of low-power, weakly magnetized jetted AGNs.

  We study the impact of environmental effects on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole mergers residing in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) near the central supermassive black hole. Using the potential hierarchical triple merger candidate GW190514-GW190521 in AGN J124942.3+344929 with its electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr as a multimessenger case study, we demonstrate that environmental effects can be negligible for mergers at approximately tens to hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole. We find $H_0=40.9_{-8.9}^{+19.3}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (median and 68\% credible interval) under a flat prior and flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Incorporating GW170817 prior information improves constraints to $H_0=68.8_{-6.0}^{+7.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We suggest that in general, AGN environments could serve as viable laboratories for cosmological studies from GW observations where environmental effects remain below detection thresholds.

  Over ten mid-infrared (mid-IR) and X-ray models are currently attempting to describe the nuclear obscuring material of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but many questions remain unresolved. This study aims to determine the physical parameters of the obscuring material in nearby AGNs and explore their relationship with nuclear activity. We selected 24 nearby Seyfert AGNs with X-ray luminosities ranging from $10^{41}$ to $10^{44}$ erg/s, using NuSTAR and Spitzer spectra. Our team fitted the spectra using a simultaneous fitting technique. Then, we compared the resulting parameters with AGN properties, such as bolometric luminosity, accretion rate, and black hole mass. Our analysis shows that dust and gas share a similar structure in most AGNs. Approximately 70% of the sample favors a combination of the X-ray UXclumpy model with the Clumpy and two-phases models at IR wavelengths. We found that linking the half-opening angle and torus angular width parameters from X-ray and mid-IR models helps constrain other parameters and break degeneracies. The study reveals that Sy1 galaxies are characterized by low covering factors, half-opening angles, and column densities but high Eddington rates. In contrast, Sy2 galaxies display higher covering factors and column densities, with a broader range of half-opening angles. We also observed that the distribution of obscuring material is closer to the nucleus in intermediate-luminosity sources, while it is more extended in more luminous AGNs. Our findings reinforce the connection between the properties of gas-dust material within 10 pc and AGN activity. Applying this methodology to a larger sample and incorporating data from facilities such as JWST and XRISM will be crucial in further refining these results.   

Embers of Active Galactic Nuclei: Tidal Disruption Events and
  Quasi-periodic Eruptions

  Recent observations have confirmed the direct association between tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). In addition, TDE hosts and QPE hosts are statistically found to be similar in their morphological properties and in the strong overrepresentation of post-starburst galaxies. Particularly, both of them show an intriguing preference for extending emission line regions (EELRs), which are indicative of recently faded active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This further suggests that QPEs might be produced following TDEs involving supermassive black holes at a particular stage, when the AGN activity has recently ceased. Moreover, in the framework of "QPEs=EMRI+accretion disk" model, a large fraction of QPE EMRIs are inferred to be quasi-circular from the QPE timing, indicating that they are wet EMRIs that were formed in the AGN disk during a previous AGN phase. Based on these facts, we propose a unified scenario that connects these three phenomena: AGN activities boost both the TDE rate and the formation rate of low-eccentricity EMRIs, consequently TDEs are preferentially found in recently faded AGNs instead of in on-going AGNs due to selection effects, and QPEs are also preferentially found in recently faded AGNs where TDEs frequently feed a misaligned accretion disk to the EMRI.

  We investigate the impact of massive primordial black holes (PBHs; $m_{\rm BH}\sim 10^6~M_{\odot}$) on the star formation and first galaxy assembly process using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations from $z = 1100$ to $z \sim 9$. We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing mass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by seeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong feedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the presence of baryon-dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH location and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more efficient star formation compared to standard $\Lambda$CDM. By $z \sim 10$, PBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios comparable to observed high-$z$ AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as viable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that PBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered overmassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of BH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels. Future studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and radio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in distinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.

  [ABRIDGED] DIBs are faint absorption features of mainly unknown origin. Observational constraints on their carriers have been provided in the vast majority of the cases via observations in our Galaxy. Detections in other galaxies are scarce. However, they can further constrain the nature of the carriers by sampling different environments and they can put into test the ubiquity of the molecules creating these features. Using the MUSE data of the LIRG NGC 6240, we mapped the DIB5780 over an almost contiguous area of ~76.96 kpc^2 in the center of the system. We also traced the DIBl6284 over two separate areas toward the north and south of the system, with an extent of ~21.22 kpc^2 and ~31.41 kpc^2 (with a total detected area of ~59.78 kpc^2). This is the first time that the l6284 DIB has been mapped outside our Galaxy. Both maps were compared with the attenuation on the overall stellar population and the ionised gas. Both DIBs are detected in locations with high attenuation (E(B-V)_Gas} &gt; 0.3 and E(B-V)_Stellar &gt;0.1), supporting the connection between DIB carriers and dust. Moreover, when compared with other galaxies, DIBs correlate better with stellar than with the ionised gas attenuation. The DIBl6284 presents a stronger correlation with reddening than the l5780 DIB does that can be attributed to a different nature of the carriers causing these DIBs, or a combined effect of a dependency with the metallicity and the different locations where these DIBs have been measured. In addition, we show that NaI D strongly correlates with both DIBs and advocate the usage of DIBs as a first order tracer for amount of material, in the case where NaI D reaches saturation. The findings here show that DIB carriers can exist and survive in an environment as extreme as a galaxy hosting AGN and allow to envision the possibilities integral field spectrographs have to study DIBs well beyond our Galaxy.

  We present spatially-resolved measurements of the ionized gas masses and mass outflow rates for six low-redshift ($z \leq$ 0.02) active galaxies. In this study, we expand our sample to galaxies with more complex gas kinematics modeled as outflows along a galactic disk that is ionized by the active galactic nucleus (AGN) bicone. We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectroscopy, Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) narrow-band imaging, and the photoionization modeling technique that we developed in Revalski et al. (2022) to calculate ionized gas masses using the [O III]/H$\beta$ ratios at each radius. We combine these with existing kinematic models to derive mass and energy outflow rates, which exhibit substantial radial variations due to changes in the outflow velocities. The full sample of 12 galaxies from this series of studies spans 10$^3$ in bolometric luminosity, and we find that the outflows contain ionized gas masses of $M \approx 10^{4.6} - 10^{7.2}$ $M_{\odot}$, reach maximum mass outflow rates of $\dot M_{out} \approx 0.1 - 13$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and encompass kinetic energies of $E \approx 10^{52} - 10^{56}$ erg. These energetic properties positively correlate with AGN luminosity. The outflow energetics are less than benchmarks for effective feedback from theoretical models, but the evacuation of gas and injection of energy may still generate long term effects on star-formation in these nearby galaxies. These results highlight the necessity of high spatial resolution imaging and spectroscopy for accurately modeling ionized outflows in active galaxies.
