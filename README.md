  Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z &gt; 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H$\alpha$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{24}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.

  We present 115 compact radio point sources in three galaxies, NGC 5474, NGC 4631 and M51, taken in the most extended (A-)configuration of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 10GHz. Several of these compact radio point sources have diffuse counterparts identified in previous multi-band studies of resolved radio continuum emission. We find compact counterparts to eight star forming regions, four anomalous microwave emission candidates, and one supernova remnant (SN 2011dh). Nine of the compact radio sources match X-ray counterparts, the majority of which are background galaxies. These AGN are all within the D25 (isophotal diameter) of the host galaxy and might act as contaminants for X-ray binary population studies, highlighting the need for high-resolution multi-band imaging. This study showcases the broad number of science cases that require sensitive radio facilities, like the upcoming Square Kilometre Array and the planned next generation Very Large Array.

  We consider if outflowing winds that are detected via narrow absorption lines (NALs) with FWHM of $&lt;$ 500 km/s (i.e., NAL outflows) in quasar spectra contribute to feedback. As our sample, we choose 11 NAL systems in eight optically luminous quasars from the NAL survey of Misawa et al. (2007a), based on the following selection criteria: i) they exhibit ``partial coverage'' suggesting quasar origin (i.e., intrinsic NALs), ii) they have at least one low-ionization absorption line (C II and/or Si II), and iii) the Ly$\alpha$ absorption line is covered by available spectra. The results depend critically on this selection method, which has caveats and uncertainties associated with it, as we discuss in a dedicated section of the paper. Using the column density ratio of the excited and ground states of C II and Si II, we place upper limits on the electron density as $n_{\rm e}$ $&lt;$ 0.2 - 18 cm$^{-3}$ and lower limits on their radial distance from the flux source $R$ as greater than several hundreds of kpc. We also calculate lower limits on the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity of $\log(\dot{M}/{\rm M_{\odot}~s}^{-1}) &gt; 79$ - (3.1$\times 10^{5})$ and $\log(\dot{E_{\rm k}}/{\rm erg~s}^{-1}) &gt; 42.9$ - 49.8, respectively. Taking the NAL selection and these results at face value, the inferred feedback efficiency can be comparable to or even larger than those of broad absorption line and other outflow classes, and large enough to generate significant AGN feedback. However, the question of the connection of quasar-driven outflows to NAL absorbers at large distances from the central engine remains open and should be addressed by future theoretical work.

  Among high-redshift galaxies, aside from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), X-ray binaries (XRBs) can be significant sources of X-ray emission. XRBs play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, reflecting the stellar populations of galaxies and regulating star formation through feedback, thereby shaping galaxy structure. In this study, we report a spectroscopically confirmed X-ray emitting galaxy pair (UDF3 and UDF3-2) at $z = 2.544$. By combining multi-wavelength observations from JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectra, JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging, Chandra, HST, VLT, ALMA, and VLA, we analyze the ionized emission lines, which are primarily driven by H II region-like processes. Additionally, we find that the mid-infrared radiation can be fully attributed to dust emission from galaxy themselves. Our results indicate that the X-ray emission from these two galaxies is dominated by high-mass XRBs, with luminosities of $L_X= (1.43\pm0.40) \times 10^{42} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3, and $(0.40\pm0.12) \times 10^{42} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3-2. Furthermore, we measure the star formation rate (SFR) of $529_{-88}^{+64}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for UDF3, placing it $\approx$ 0.5 dex below the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This offset reflects the redshift-dependent enhancement of $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation, which is influenced by metallicity and serves as a key observable for XRB evolution. In contrast, UDF3-2, with the SFR of $34_{-6}^{+6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, aligns well with the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This galaxy pair represents the highest-redshift non-AGN-dominated galaxies with individual X-ray detections reported to date. This finding suggests that the contribution of XRBs to galaxy X-ray emission at high redshift may be underestimated.

  We present a deep high-resolution Chandra X-ray Observatory image data of a powerful compact radio source PKS 0023-26 associated with a quasar at redshift 0.322. The earlier studies of the optical environment suggested that the source could be located in a galaxy cluster or a group. However, we report a non-detection of hot gas on large scales (out to $\sim 60$ kpc radius) and place an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of $&lt;3\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent only with the presence of a poor, low-temperature ($\rm kT &lt; 0.5$ keV) galaxy group. X-ray spectral analysis of the central circular region, $r&lt;7$ kpc shows, in addition to the mildly absorbed AGN, a thermal emission component with a temperature of $\rm kT=0.9^{+0.19}_{-0.37}$ keV. We discuss the origin of this hot component as a result of interaction between the evolving radio source and the interstellar medium. Our high angular resolution X-ray image traces the distribution of hot gas which is closely aligned with and extends beyond the radio source, and also in the direction perpendicular to the radio source axis. The X-rays are enhanced at the northern radio lobe and the location of the peak of the CO(3-2)/CO(2-1) line emission, suggesting that the interactions between the jet and cold medium result in the X-ray radiation which excites CO. The shock driven by the jet into the ISM is supersonic with the Mach number of $\mathcal{M} \sim 1.75-2$, creating the cocoon of hot X-rays surrounding the radio source. This result agrees with observations of shocks in other radio galaxies pointing to a prevalent impact of jets on ISM.

  The relation between the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies encodes information on their mode of growth, especially at the earliest epochs. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened such investigations by detecting the host galaxies of AGN and more luminous quasars within the first billion years of the universe (z &gt; 6). Here, we evaluate the relation between the mass of SMBHs and the total stellar mass of their host galaxies using a sample of nine quasars at 6.18 &lt; z &lt; 6.4 from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey with NIRCam and NIRSpec observations. We find that the observed location of these quasars in the SMBH-galaxy mass plane (log MBH ~ 8-9; log M* ~9.5-11) is consistent with a non-evolving intrinsic mass relation with dispersion (0.80_{-0.28}^{+0.23} dex) higher than the local value (~0.3-0.4 dex). Our analysis is based on a forward model of systematics and includes a consideration of the impact of selection effects and measurement uncertainties, an assumption on the slope of the mass relation, and finds a reasonable AGN fraction (2.3%) of galaxies at z ~ 6 with an actively growing UV-unobscured black hole. In particular, models with a substantially higher normalisation in MBH would require an unrealistically low intrinsic dispersion (~0.22 dex) and a lower AGN fraction (~0.6%). Consequently, our results predict a large population of AGNs at lower black hole masses, as are now just starting to be discovered in focused efforts with JWST.
