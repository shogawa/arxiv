  This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of 30 ks Chandra and 46.8 ks (13 Hr) 1.4 GHz GMRT radio data on the cool-core cluster RXCJ0352.9+1941 with an objective to investigate AGN activities at its core. This study confirms a pair of X-ray cavities at projected distances of about 10.30 kpc and 20.80 kpc, respectively, on the NW and SE of the X-ray peak. GMRT L band (1.4 GHz) data revealed a bright radio source associated with the core of this cluster hosting multiple jet-like emissions. The spatial association of the X-ray cavities with the inner pair of radio jets confirm their origin due to AGN outbursts. The 1.4 GHz radio power ${\rm 7.4 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{39} \, erg\, s^{-1}}$ is correlated with the mechanical power stored in the X-ray cavities ($\sim7.90\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), implying that the power injected by radio jets in the ICM is sufficient enough to offset the radiative losses. The X-shaped morphology of diffuse radio emission seems to be comprised of two pairs of orthogonal radio jets, likely formed due to a spin-flip of jets due to the merger of two systems. The X-ray surface brightness analysis of the ICM in its environment revealed two non-uniform, extended spiral-like emission structures on either side of the core, pointing towards the sloshing of gas due to a minor merger and might have resulted in a cold front at $\sim$31 arcsec (62 kpc) with a temperature jump of 1.44 keV.

  The optical spectroscopic classification of active galactic nuclei (AGN) into type 1 and type 2 can be understood in the frame of the AGN unification models. However, it remains unclear which physical properties are driving the classification into intermediate sub-types (1.0,1.2,1.5,1.8,1.9). To shed light on this issue, we present an analysis of the effect of extinction and AGN and host galaxy luminosities on sub-type determination for a sample of 159 X-ray selected AGN with a complete and robust optical spectroscopic classification. The sample spans a rest-frame 2 - 10 keV X-ray luminosity range of $10^{42}-10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and redshifts between 0.05 and 0.75. From the fitting of their UV-to-mid-infrared spectral energy distributions, we extracted the observed AGN over total AGN+galaxy contrast, optical/UV line-of-sight extinction as well as host galaxy and AGN luminosities. The observed contrast exhibits a clear decline with sub-type, distinguishing two main groups: 1.0-5 and 1.8-9/2. This difference is partly driven by an increase in extinction following the same trend. Nevertheless, 50% of 1.9s and 2s lack sufficient extinction to explain the lack of detection of broad emission lines, unveiling the necessity of an additional effect. Our findings show that 1.8-9/2s preferentially live in host galaxies with higher luminosities while displaying similar intrinsic AGN luminosities to 1.0-5s. Consequently, the AGN to host galaxy luminosity ratio diminishes, hindering the detection of the emission of the broad emission lines, resulting in the 1.8-9/2 classification of those with insufficient extinction. Thus, the combination of increasing extinction and decreasing AGN/galaxy luminosity ratio, mainly driven by an increasing host galaxy luminosity, constitutes the main reasons behind the sub-type classification into 1.0-5 and 1.8-9/2.

  Star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies are affected by a variety of factors, both external (field vs. cluster/group) and internal (presence of a bar and AGN, morphological type). In this work, we extend our previous study and apply the &lt;SFR5&gt;/&lt;SFR200&gt; metric to a sample of eleven nearby galaxies with MUSE observations. Based on a combination of H$\alpha$ and UV photometry, &lt;SFR5&gt;/&lt;SFR200&gt; is sensitive to star formation timescales of ~5-200 Myr and therefore measures the present-day rate of change in the star formation rate, dSFR/dt. Within this limited galaxy sample, we do not observe systematic variations between the global value of &lt;SFR5&gt;/&lt;SFR200&gt; and the presence of an active galactic nucleus, stellar bar, nor with group or cluster membership. Within some of the individual galaxies, we however observe significant differences in &lt;SFR5&gt;/&lt;SFR200&gt; between the arm and interarm regions. In half of the galaxies, the recent SFH of both arm and interarm regions has been very similar. However, in the galaxies with higher bulge-to-total light ratios and earlier morphological type, the SFR is declining more rapidly in the interarm regions. This decline in SFR is not a result of low molecular gas surface density or a decrease in the star formation efficiency, implying that other factors are responsible for this SFR decrease.

  The population-wide properties and demographics of extragalactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) correlate with the star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses ($M_{\star}$), and environmental factors (such as metallicity, $Z$) of their host galaxy. Although there is evidence that XRB scaling relations ($L_X$/SFR for high mass XRBs [HMXBs] and $L_X$/$M_{\star}$ for low mass XRBs [LMXBs]) may depend on metallicity and stellar age across large samples of XRB-hosting galaxies, disentangling the effects of metallicity and stellar age from stochastic effects, particularly on subgalactic scales, remains a challenge. We use archival X-ray through IR observations of the nearby galaxy NGC 300 to self-consistently model the broadband spectral energy distribution and examine radial trends in its XRB population. We measure a current ($&lt;$100 Myr) SFR of 0.18$\pm$0.08 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $M_{\star}$= $(2.15^{+0.26}_{-0.14})\times10^9$ $M_{\odot}$. Although we measure a metallicity gradient and radially resolved star formation histories that are consistent with the literature, there is a clear excess in the number of X-ray sources below $\sim10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ that are likely a mix of variable XRBs and additional background AGN. When we compare the subgalactic $L_X$/SFR ratios as a function of $Z$ to the galaxy-integrated $L_X$-SFR-$Z$ relationships from the literature, we find that only the regions hosting the youngest ($\lesssim$30 Myr) HMXBs agree with predictions, hinting at time evolution of the $L_X$-SFR-$Z$ relationship.

  We present rest-frame optical spectra from Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES of 16 candidate ultramassive galaxies targeted as part of the Massive Ancient Galaxies at $z&gt;3$ Near-Infrared (MAGAZ3NE) Survey. These candidates were selected to have photometric redshifts $3\lesssim z_{\rm phot}&lt;4$, photometric stellar masses log($M$/M$_\odot$)$&gt;11.7$, and well-sampled photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the UltraVISTA and VIDEO surveys. In contrast to previous spectroscopic observations of blue star-forming and post-starburst ultramassive galaxies, candidates in this sample have very red SEDs implying significant dust attenuation, old stellar ages, and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN). Of these galaxies, eight are revealed to be heavily dust-obscured $2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7$ galaxies with strong emission lines, some showing broad features indicative of AGN, three are Type I AGN hosts at $z&gt;3$, one is a $z\sim1.2$ dusty galaxy, and four galaxies do not have a confirmed spectroscopic redshift. In fact, none of the sample has |$z_{\rm spec}-z_{\rm phot}$|$&lt;0.5$, suggesting difficulties for photometric redshift programs in fitting similarly red SEDs. The prevalence of these red interloper galaxies suggests that the number densities of high-mass galaxies are overestimated at $z\gtrsim3$ in large photometric surveys, helping to resolve the `impossibly early galaxy problem' and leading to much better agreement with cosmological galaxy simulations. A more complete spectroscopic survey of ultramassive galaxies is required to pin down the uncertainties on their number densities in the early universe.

  We report on deep SCUBA-2 observations at 850$\mu$m and NOEMA spectroscopic measurements at 2 mm of the environment surrounding the luminous, massive ($M_{*} \approx 2 \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$) Herschel-selected source HerBS-70. This source was revealed by previous NOEMA observations to be a binary system of dusty star-forming galaxies at $z= 2.3$, with the East component (HerBS-70E) hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). The SCUBA-2 observations detected, in addition to the binary system, twenty-one sources at $&gt; 3.5 \sigma$ over an area of $\sim 25$ square comoving Mpc with a sensitivity of $\sigma_{850} = 0.75$ mJy. The surface density of continuum sources around HerBS-70 is three times higher than for field galaxies. The NOEMA spectroscopic measurements confirm the protocluster membership of three of the nine brightest sources through their CO(4 - 3) line emission, yielding a volume density 36 times higher than for field galaxies. All five confirmed sub-mm galaxies in the HerBS-70 system have relatively short gas depletion times ($80 - 500$ Myr), indicating the onset of quenching for this protocluster core due to the depletion of gas. The dark matter halo mass of the HerBS-70 system is estimated around $5 \times{} 10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$, with a projected current-day mass of $10^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$, similar to the local Virgo and Coma clusters. These observations support the claim that DSFGs, in particular the ones with observed multiplicity, can trace cosmic overdensities.   

The Black-Hole Masses of High-Redshift QSOs

  Observations of high-redshift quasars frequently promote suggestions of large black hole masses, whose presence so early in cosmic time is not easily explicable. I consider the parallel with ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) -- now known to be stellar-mass black hole (and neutron star) binaries apparently radiating far above their Eddington luminosities $L_{\rm Edd}$. The true luminosity in ULXs is actually only of order $L_{\rm Edd}$, for {\it stellar-mass} accretors, but has a very anisotropic (`beamed') component, plus a near-isotropic component of similar luminosity but much lower specific intensity. Observers viewing ULXs from within the beam but assuming spherical symmetry deduce a luminosity $\gg L_{\rm Edd}$. These features appear because the accretors are fed mass at highly super-Eddington rates, most of it expelled in high-speed ($v &gt;0.2c$) outflows from the accretion disc.   I show that in similarly-beamed AGN, emission-line properties would be essentially the same as in unbeamed sources, but standard virial mass indicators unusable because velocity widths are dominated by the outflows, not bound motions about the black holes. In an ensemble of this kind the apparently most luminous systems are always the most distant, but have the lowest black hole masses. Interpreting observations of this ensemble without knowing that they are beamed leads instead to very high black hole mass estimates. The analogy with ULXs therefore suggests that high-redshift quasars might actually have central black hole masses which could have grown from stellar values within the lookback time. I consider how one might test these ideas observationally.
