  Does a broad-line region (BLR) wind in radio-quiet (RQ) active galactic nuclei (AGN) extend to pc scales and produce radio emission? We explore the correlations between a pc-scale radio wind and the BLR wind in a sample of 19 RQ Palomar-Green (PG) quasars. The radio wind is defined based on the spectral slope and the compactness of the emission at 1.5-5 GHz, and the BLR wind is defined by the excess blue wing in the C IV emission line profile. The five objects with both radio and BLR wind indicators are found at high Eddington ratios L/L_Edd (&gt; 0.66), and eight of the nine objects with neither radio nor BLR winds reside at low L/L_Edd (&lt; 0.28). This suggests that the BLR wind and the radio wind in RQ AGN are related to a radiation pressure driven wind. Evidence for free-free absorption by AGN photoionized gas, which flattens the spectral slope, is found in two objects. Radio outflows in three low L/L_Edd (0.05-0.12) objects are likely from a low-power jet, as suggested by additional evidence. The presence of a mild equatorial BLR wind in four intermediate L/L_Edd (0.2-0.4) objects can be tested with future spectropolarimetry.

  We revisit the relation between active galactic nucleus (AGN) broad-line region (BLR) size and luminosity by conducting a uniform H$\beta$ reverberation-mapping analysis for 212 AGNs with archival light curves. Our analysis incorporates three different lag measurement methods, including the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF), JAVELIN, and PyROA, alongside a consistently defined lag searching window and an alias removal procedure. We find that ICCF, albeit with larger uncertainties compared to other methods, is the most reliable method based on our visual inspection of the matches between H$\beta$ and the shifted continuum light curves. Combining this sample with the 32 AGNs from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project, we obtain the best-fit relation between the BLR size ($R_{\rm BLR}$) and the continuum luminosity at 5100$\r{A}$ ($L_{5100}$) with a slope significantly flatter than 0.5. By selecting a subsample of 157 AGNs with the best-quality lag measurements using a set of quantitative criteria and visual inspection, we find a consistent slope and a slightly decreased intrinsic scatter. We further investigate the effect of luminosity tracers, including $L_{5100}$, H$\beta$ luminosity ($L_{\rm H\beta}$), ${\rm [O\,\mathrm{III}]}$ luminosity ($L_{\rm [O\,\mathrm{III}]}$), and 2 to 10 keV hard X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm 2\unicode{x2013}10\,keV}$). We find that sub-Eddington and super-Eddington AGNs exhibit systematic offsets in both $R_{\rm BLR}$$\unicode{x2013}$$L_{5100}$ and $R_{\rm BLR}$$\unicode{x2013}$$L_{\rm H\beta}$ relation, but are comparable in the $R_{\rm BLR}$$\unicode{x2013}$$L_{\rm [O\,\mathrm{III}]}$ and $R_{\rm BLR}$$\unicode{x2013}$$L_{\rm 2\unicode{x2013}10\,keV}$ relation. We discuss the potential causes for these different deviations when employing different luminosity tracers.

  In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) among the $\sim 300$ publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the CEERS Survey. Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGN at $2\lesssim z\lesssim 9$ on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified 4 new $z\lesssim 2$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN), in addition to the 8 previously reported high-$z$ BLAGN. We found that the traditional BPT diagnostic diagrams are not suited to identify high-$z$ AGN, while most of the high-$z$ NLAGN are selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]$\lambda$4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration of the sample of NLAGN with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGN heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies' physical properties, as further confirmed by SED-fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-$z$ NLAGNs selected in this work are well below those sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGN. Finally, we investigate the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGN and of the sample of high-$z$ BLAGN. We find that all but 4 NLAGN are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-$z$ BLAGN. We do not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of $\sim 1-2$ dex from what is expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection leaving open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.
