  Observations of high-redshift quasars frequently promote suggestions of large black hole masses, whose presence so early in cosmic time is not easily explicable. I consider the parallel with ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) -- now known to be stellar-mass black hole (and neutron star) binaries apparently radiating far above their Eddington luminosities $L_{\rm Edd}$. The true luminosity in ULXs is actually only of order $L_{\rm Edd}$, for {\it stellar-mass} accretors, but has a very anisotropic (`beamed') component, plus a near-isotropic component of similar luminosity but much lower specific intensity. Observers viewing ULXs from within the beam but assuming spherical symmetry deduce a luminosity $\gg L_{\rm Edd}$. These features appear because the accretors are fed mass at highly super-Eddington rates, most of it expelled in high-speed ($v &gt;0.2c$) outflows from the accretion disc.   I show that in similarly-beamed AGN, emission-line properties would be essentially the same as in unbeamed sources, but standard virial mass indicators unusable because velocity widths are dominated by the outflows, not bound motions about the black holes. In an ensemble of this kind the apparently most luminous systems are always the most distant, but have the lowest black hole masses. Interpreting observations of this ensemble without knowing that they are beamed leads instead to very high black hole mass estimates. The analogy with ULXs therefore suggests that high-redshift quasars might actually have central black hole masses which could have grown from stellar values within the lookback time. I consider how one might test these ideas observationally.

  We have carried out a deep survey of the M81 field in the 25-60 keV energy band based on long-term (2003-2023) INTEGRAL observations. A record sensitivity of 0.16 mCrab at a detection significance of 4 sigma has been achieved in the central part of the field owing to the long accumulated exposure (19.2 Ms). The total area of the survey is 1004 deg^2 at a sensitivity level better than 0.72 mCrab. We have produced a catalog of sources detected at a significance level higher than 4 sigma. It contains 51 objects most of which are active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The median redshift of the Seyfert galaxies in the catalog is z=0.0366. Six sources have not been detected previously in any of the X-ray surveys. According to the available indirect data, all of them and two more sources that have already been entered previously into the INTEGRAL survey catalogs can also be AGNs, including those with strong internal absorption.

  We report the detection of extended (&gt;0.5-1kpc) high-ionization [MgIV] 4.487 $\mu$m (80 eV) emission in four local luminous infrared galaxies observed with JWST/NIRSpec. Excluding the nucleus and outflow of the Type 1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the sample, we find that the [MgIV] luminosity is well correlated with that of H recombination lines, which mainly trace star forming clumps in these objects, and that the [ArVI] 4.530 $\mu$m (75 eV), usually seen in AGN, is undetected. On 100-400pc scales, the [MgIV] line profiles are broader (sigma([MgIV])=90 +- 25 km/s) and shifted (Delta_v up to +- 50 km/s) compared to those of the H recombination lines and lower ionization transitions (e.g., sigma(Hu-12)=57 +- 15 km/s). The [MgIV] kinematics follow the large scale rotating velocity field of these galaxies and the broad [MgIV] profiles are compatible with the broad wings detected in the H recombination lines. Based on these observational results, extended highly ionized gas more turbulent than the ambient interstellar medium, possibly as a result of ionizing shocks associated with star-formation, is the most likely origin of the [MgIV] emission. We also computed new grids of photoionization and shock models to investigate where the [MgIV] line originates. Shocks with velocities of 100-130 km/s reproduce the observed line ratios and the [MgIV] luminosity agrees with that expected from the mechanical energy released by supernove (SNe) in these regions. Therefore, these models support shocks induced by SNe as the origin of the [MgIV] line. Future studies on the stellar feedback from SNe will benefit from the [MgIV] line that is little affected by obscuration and, in absence of an AGN, can only be produced by shocks due to its high ionization potential.

  The radio galaxy PKS 1007+142 is classified as a compact steep-spectrum source (CSS) and belongs to the class of young Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we investigate the $\gamma$-ray emission from this CSS by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the 15 yr Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) observation data. The Fermi-LAT latest Source Catalog, 4FGL-DR4, includes an unassociated $\gamma$-ray source, 4FGL J1010.0+1416, located at 0.24{\deg} away from the radio position of PKS 1007+142. Using the 15 yr Fermi-LAT observation data, we re-estimate the best-fit position of the $\gamma$-ray source and find that PKS 1007+142 is in close proximity to the $\gamma$-ray source and falls within its 68% error circle. Therefore, we conclude that PKS 1007+142 is the most plausible counterpart to the unassociated LAT source with a detection test statistics (TS) $\sim$43.4 ($\sim 6.6\sigma$). PKS 1007+142 exhibits a steep power-law spectrum in the 0.1--300 GeV band, with a photon spectral index ($\Gamma_{\gamma}$) of $2.86\pm0.17$. The average flux in the considered time interval is $\rm (2.14\pm0.34)\times10^{-12}\ erg\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}$. Comparing PKS 1007+142 with other $\gamma$-ray emitting AGNs in both the $L_{\gamma}-\Gamma_{\gamma}$ and $L_\gamma-L_{\rm 1.4GHz}$ planes, it shows a softer $\gamma$-ray spectrum and lower luminosity compared to other $\gamma$-ray emitting CSSs. Furthermore, the possible origins of $\gamma$-ray in PKS 1007+142 are also discussed.

  Context : Understanding the mechanisms that launch and shape powerful relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies over cosmic time.   Aims :We study the high-redshift ($z=3.396$) blazar OH~471 to explore the jet launching mechanism in the early Universe.   Methods : Using multi-frequency radio monitoring observations and high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging over three decades, we study the milliarcsecond structure and long-term variability of OH~471.   Results : Spectral modelling of the radio flux densities reveals a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum indicating strong magnetic fields within the compact core. By applying the flux freezing approximation, we estimate the magnetic flux carried by the jet and find that it reaches or exceeds theoretical predictions for jets powered by black hole spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This implies that OH~471 was in a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the magnetic flux accumulated near the horizon regulates the accretion flow, allowing efficient extraction of black hole rotational energy.   Conclusions : Our study demonstrates the dominance of MAD accretion in powering the prominent radio flares and relativistic jets observed in the radio-loud AGN OH~471 and statistical studies of large samples of high-redshift AGN will shed light on the role of MAD accretion in launching and accelerating the earliest relativistic jets.

  In disk wind models for active galactic nuclei (AGN) outflows, high-energy radiation poses a significant problem wherein the gas can become overionized, effectively disabling what is often inferred to be the largest force acting on the gas: the radiation force due to spectral line opacity. Calculations of this radiation force depend on the magnitude of ionizing radiation, which can strongly depend on the position above a disk where the radiation is anisotropic. As our first step to quantify the position and direction dependence of the radiation field, we assumed free streaming of photons and computed energy distributions of the mean intensity and components of flux as well as energy-integrated quantities such as mean photon energy. We find a significant dependence of radiation field properties on position, but this dependence is not necessarily the same for different field quantities. A key example is that the mean intensity is much softer than the radial flux at many points near the disk. Because the mean intensity largely controls ionization, this softening decreases the severity of the overionization problem. The position dependence of mean intensity implies the position dependence of gas opacity, which we illustrate by computing the radiation force a fluid element feels in an accelerating wind. We find that in a vertical accelerating flow, the force due to radiation is not parallel to the radiation flux. This misalignment is due to the force's geometric weighting by both the velocity field's directionality and the position dependence of the mean intensity.

  Polar dust has been discovered in a number of local Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), with radiation-driven torus models predicting a wind to be its main driver. However, little is known about its characteristics, spatial extent, or connection to the larger scale outflows. We present the first JWST/MIRI study aimed at imaging polar dust by zooming onto the heart of ESO 428-G14, part of the GATOS survey of local AGN. We clearly detect extended mid-infrared (MIR) emission within 200 pc from the nucleus. This polar structure is co-linear with a radio jet and lies perpendicular to a molecular gas lane that feeds and obscures the nucleus. The morphology of the MIR structure bears a striking resemblance to that of gas ionised by the AGN in the narrow-line region (NLR). We demonstrate that part of this spatial correspondence is due to contamination within the JWST filter bands from strong emission lines. Correcting for the contamination using ancillary spectroscopy, we find the morphology of the dust continuum to be asymmetric around the nucleus and more compact, though still clearly extended out to r ~ 100 pc. We estimate a temperature of the emitting dust of ~ 120 K. Using simple models, we find that the heating of small dust grains (~ 0.01 microns) by the radiation from the central AGN and/or radiative jet-induced shocks is responsible for the extended MIR emission. Large-grained dust, predicted by models of radiation-driven dusty winds from the torus, is unlikely to be important. This has important implications for scales to which AGN winds can carry dust and dense gas out into their host galaxies.
