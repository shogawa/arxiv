  Powerful, galactic outflows driven by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are commonly considered as a main mechanism to regulate star formation in massive galaxies. Ultra- and hyper-luminous IR galaxies (U/HyLIRGs) are thought to represent a transition phase of galaxies from a rapidly growing period to a quiescent status as gas swept out by outflows, providing a laboratory to investigate outflows and their feedback effects on the hosts. In this paper we report recent Gemini and ALMA observations of a HyLIRG, J1126 at $z=0.46842$, which has been identified with a puzzling co-existence of a fast ionized outflow ($&gt;2000$ km s$^{-1}$) and an intense starburst (star formation rate of 800 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The Gemini observation shows the fast ionized outflow is extended to several kpc with a mass-loss rate of 180 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. A massive molecular outflow with a high mass-loss rate (2500 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is revealed by ALMA. The multi-phase outflows show large factors of momentum boost and loading of kinetic power, indicating a driving by thermal pressure of a nuclear hot wind and/or radiation pressure of a highly obscured AGN. In addition to ejection of kinetic energy, it is also found that the powerful outflow can induce an ionizing shock in the galaxy disk and enhance the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas. The powerful outflow probably results in an instantaneous negative feedback and shows potential to regulate the host growth in a long term.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundant population of compact, extremely red, and X-ray weak objects at $z\gtrsim4$, knows as ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). These objects exhibit spectral energy distributions that resemble both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and stellar population templates. However, whether dominated by AGN activity or compact star formation, the high redshifts and masses/luminosities of LRDs, coupled with their significant abundance, present potential challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we proposes a novel cosmic interpretation of this anomaly, suggesting that these LRDs are likely massive galaxies seeded by supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) came into being in the very early universe. We analyze 434 known LRDs from the 0.54 ${\rm deg}^2$ COSMOS-Web survey and test the hypothesis that they originated from SMPBHs assuming sub-Eddington accretion. According to our result, SMPBHs actually could lead to the existence of more LRDs, even at higher redshifts ($z&gt;8$).

  Identifying the dominant ionizing sources in galaxies is essential for understanding their formation and evolution. Traditionally, spectra are classified based on their dominant ionizing source using strong emission lines and Baldwin, Phillips, \&amp; Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. The ionizing source is traditionally determined by the emission line ratios using the BPT diagrams. Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions (LINERs) are a class of ionizing mechanisms that is observationally identified but with a poorly understood origin, unlike the case of star forming regions and active galactic nuclei (AGN). LINERs, typically found in early-type galaxies, are often associated with low-luminosity AGN activity but may also be powered by aging stellar populations, particularly post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (p-AGB) stars. In this study, we employ a machine-learning-based encoder, Spender, to analyze the full MaNGA IFU spectra and identify key spectral features of LINERs. By examining the continuum and line emission of these spaxels, our approach aims to uncover hidden patterns and better understand the dominant ionizing sources. We show in this work that the neural network-based encoder was able identify LINER sources from the stellar continuum alone. The characteristics of the stellar population underlying LINER regions are consistent with evolved low mass stars implying that the source driving LINER emission is probably p-AGB stars rather than AGN activity.

  The geometrically thick dusty torus structure is believed to exist in the nuclear region of galaxies (especially in active galactic nuclei, AGNs). The debris stream from a tidal disruption event (TDE) will possibly collide with the dusty torus and produce a transient flare. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model the dynamical evolution of the interaction between unbound debris and dusty torus. During the continuous interaction, the shocked material will be spilled out from the interaction region and form an outflow. We calculate the temporal evolution of synchrotron emission by assuming that the shock accelerates a fraction of electrons in the outflow into a non-thermal distribution. We find that radio emission from the debris-torus collision generates a steep-rise and slow-decline radio light curve due to the sharp edge and dense gas of dusty torus, where the radio outburst delays the main optical/X-ray outburst by several years or even several tens of years. We apply our model to a TDE that happened in a narrow-line Seyfert I (PS16dtm), where both the radio spectrum and the light curve can be roughly reproduced. Future high-sensitivity, wide-field-of-view radio surveys have the opportunity to detect more such radio flares.

  Outflows are critical components of many astrophysical systems, including accreting compact binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These outflows can significantly affect a system's evolution and alter its observational appearance by reprocessing the radiation produced by the central engine. Sirocco (Simulating Ionization and Radiation in Outflows Created by Compact Objects - or "the code formerly known as Python") is a Sobolev-based Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. It is designed to simulate the spectra produced by any system with an azimuthally-symmetric outflow, from spherical stellar winds to rotating, biconical accretion disc winds. Wind models can either be parametrized or imported, e.g. from hydrodynamical simulations. The radiation sources include an optically thick accretion disc and various central sources with flexible spectra and geometries. The code tracks the "photon packets" produced by the sources in any given simulation as they traverse and interact with the wind. The code assumes radiative near-equilibrium, so the thermal and ionization state can be determined iteratively from these interactions. Once the physical properties in the wind have converged, Sirocco can be used to generate synthetic spectra at a series of observer sightlines. Here, we describe the physical assumptions, operation, performance and limitations of the code. We validate it against tardis, cmfgen and cloudy, finding good agreement, and present illustrative synthetic spectra from disc winds in cataclysmic variables, tidal disruption events, AGN and X-ray binaries. Sirocco is publicly available on GitHub, alongside its associated data, documentation and sample input files covering a wide range of astrophysical applications.   

How to Escape from a Trap: Outcomes of Repeated Black Hole Mergers in
  AGN

  Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGN) may be major sources of astrophysical gravitational waves (GWs), contributing both to the observed LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA population of binary BH mergers and to future populations of LISA-band extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The ability of these BHs to pair up into binaries, inspiral, and produce GWs will be shaped by the existence of migration traps, regions in the AGN where hydrodynamic torques vanish. Previous works have studied the existence and location of migration traps in AGN disks. Here, we investigate how individual BHs may escape such traps as an outcome of mergers, potentially suppressing hierarchical growth. We find that while GW recoil kicks are strong enough to kick merged BHs onto inclined orbits, gas drag quickly realigns them into the AGN disk. A more robust escape mechanism is gap opening: once a BH grows above a critical mass, its gravity disturbs the AGN gas sufficiently to eliminate the trap. In low-mass AGN relevant for LISA, gaps open easily and the resulting ``wet EMRI'' masses are unlikely to reflect protracted hierarchical mergers. In combination with our previous work, we find that migration traps only exist in a relatively narrow range of AGN luminosities between [10^{43.5},10^{45.5}] erg/s. We identify an even narrower AGN luminosity range for which stellar mass BHs can grow into the pair instability mass gap and beyond. This characteristic luminosity scale may assist in indirect tests of the ``AGN channel'' for binary BH mergers.
