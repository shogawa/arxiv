  We present an investigation of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) as potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We focus on cosmic-ray nuclei, an aspect not explored previously. These large-scale, mildly-relativistic outflows, characterised by velocities up to half the speed of light, are a common feature of AGN. We study the cosmic-ray spectrum and maximum energy attainable in these environments with 3D CRPropa simulations and apply our method to 87 observed UFOs. Iron nuclei can be accelerated up to $\sim10^{20}\,$eV at the wind-termination shock in some UFOs, but the escaping flux is strongly attenuated due to photonuclear interactions with intense AGN photon fields. The maximum energy of nuclei escaping most UFOs is interaction-limited to below $\sim 10^{17}\,$eV and scales with the mass number. In the most extreme $\sim10\%$ of UFOs in our sample, nitrogen and helium escape with energy exceeding $10^{17.6}\,$eV. Protons and neutrons, either primaries or by-products of photodisintegration, escape UFOs with little attenuation, with half of the observed UFOs reaching energies exceeding $10^{18}\,$eV. Thus, UFOs emerge as viable sources of the diffuse cosmic-ray flux between the end of the Galactic cosmic-rays and the highest-energy extragalactic flux. We demonstrate that UFOs can fill this part of the spectrum in terms of energetics, spectral shape and chemical composition and that the role of UFOs as UHECR sources is testable with neutrino telescopes due to a substantial accompanying neutrino flux with peak energy around a few PeV. For a small subset of UFOs in our sample, nuclei can escape without photodisintegration with energy up to $10^{19.8}\,$eV. This occurs during low-emission states of the AGN, which would make UFOs intermittent sources of UHECR nuclei up to the highest observed energies.

  Ram pressure stripping (RPS) is an important process that plays a significant role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies and their surrounding environment. Despite its recognized significance, the potential connection between RPS and AGN activity in cluster galaxies remains poorly understood. Recent claims, based on optical emission line diagnostics, have suggested such a connection. Here, we investigate this relationship from an X-ray perspective using a sample of galaxies undergoing RPS in four nearby galaxy clusters - A1656, A1367, A426, and A3627. This study is the first to test such a connection from an X-ray standpoint. Our analysis reveals no signs of enhanced X-ray AGN activity in our sample, with most RPS galaxies ($\sim$ $90\%$) showing X-ray luminosities below $10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in their central point sources. Moreover, there is no noticeable difference in X-ray AGN activity among RPS galaxies compared to a control sample of non-RPS galaxies, as demonstrated by similar X-ray luminosities observed in their central point sources. While the most luminous X-ray AGN in our sample is found in ESO 137-002, a galaxy undergoing RPS in A3627, there is no evidence for a widespread enhancement of X-ray AGN activity due to RPS. Given the limited sample size of our study, this could also indicate that either the X-ray AGN enhancement from RPS is at most weak, or the timescale for the X-ray AGN enhancement is short. This emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger X-ray samples to better understand the impact of RPS on AGN activity in cluster galaxies.

  Both star formation (SF) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play an important role in galaxy evolution. Statistically quantifying their relative importance can be done using radio luminosity functions. Until now these relied on galaxy classifications, where sources with a mixture of radio emission from SF and AGN are labelled as either a star-forming galaxy or an AGN. This can cause the misestimation of the relevance of AGN. Brightness temperature measurements at 144 MHz with the International LOFAR telescope can separate radio emission from AGN and SF. We use the combination of sub-arcsec and arcsec resolution imaging of 7,497 sources in the Lockman Hole and ELAIS-N1 fields to identify AGN components in the sub-arcsec resolution images and subtract them from the total flux density, leaving flux density from SF only. We construct, for the first time, radio luminosity functions by physical process, either SF or AGN activity, revealing a hidden AGN population at $L_{\textrm{144MHz}}$$&lt;10^{24}$ W$\,$Hz$^{-1}$ . This population is 1.56$\pm$0.06 more than expected for $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0$ when comparing to RLFs by galaxy classification. The star forming population has only 0.90$\pm$0.02 of the expected SF. These 'hidden' AGN can have significant implications for the cosmic star formation rate and kinetic luminosity densities.
