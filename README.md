  X-ray surveys provide the most efficient means for the detection of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, they face difficulties in detecting the most heavily obscured Compton-thick AGN. The BAT detector on board the Gehrels/Swift mission, operating in the very hard 14-195 keV band, has provided the largest samples of Compton-thick AGN in the local Universe. However, even these flux limited samples can miss the most obscured sources among the Compton-thick AGN population. A robust way to find these local sources is to systematically study volume-limited AGN samples detected in the IR or the optical part of the spectrum. Here, we utilize a local sample (&lt;100 Mpc) of mid-IR selected AGN, unbiased against obscuration, to determine the fraction of Compton-thick sources in the local universe. When available we acquire X-ray spectral information for the sources in our sample from previously published studies. Additionally, to maximize the X-ray spectral information for the sources in our sample, we analyse, for the first time, eleven unexplored XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations, identifying four new Compton-thick sources. Our results reveal an increased fraction of Compton-thick AGN among the sources that have not been detected by BAT of 44 %. Overall we estimate a fraction of Compton thick sources in the local universe of 25-30% among mid-IR selected AGN. We find no evidence for evolution of the AGN Compton-thick fraction with luminosity.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to uncover faint galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early universe. Taking advantage of the unique filter combination used in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) program, we perform an extensive photometric search of galaxies emitting strong H$\beta+$[O III] and H$\alpha$ lines. The redshift range of the galaxies is limited to $5.03\leq z\leq 5.26$ by requiring photometric excesses in NIRCam's F277W and F410M images. A total of 261 H$\beta+$[O III] and H$\alpha$ dual-line emitters are found over the absolute UV magnitude $-22\lesssim M_{\mathrm{UV}}\lesssim -17$, with a mean rest-frame equivalent width of 1010 A for H$\beta+$[O III] and 1040 A for H$\alpha$. This population accounts for $\sim 40\%$ of the Lyman break galaxies at this redshift range. Intriguingly, there are 58 objects (22% of the whole sample) that exhibit compact morphology at the rest-UV or optical wavelength. With an assumption that these compact dual-line emitters are dominated by AGN, their AGN bolometric luminosities are in the range of $2\times 10^{43} \lesssim L_{\rm bol}/({\rm erg~s}^{-1})\lesssim 3\times 10^{44}$. Their number density is two orders of magnitude higher than the extrapolation from the UV-selected luminous quasars, which is in good agreement with previous JWST studies of broad-line AGNs, requiring a $\sim 10\%$ of the AGN duty cycle. Moreover, our dual-line emitter sample reaches the faint end of the H$\alpha$ and [O III] luminosity functions down to $\lesssim 10^{42}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}$. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are planned in an approved JWST Cycle 3 program, in which we aim to confirm their nature, characterize their black hole activity, and construct their mass distribution at $10^6\lesssim M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^8$.

  Arecibo 305-m Telescope observations between 2008 and 2018 detected a radio continuum and spectral-line outburst in the nearby galaxy, NGC 660. Excited-OH maser emission/absorption lines near 4.7 GHz, and H$_2$CO absorption at 4.83 GHz varied on time-scales of months. Simultaneously, a continuum outburst occurred in which a new compact component appeared, with a GHz-peaked spectrum and a 5-GHz flux density that rose to a peak value of about 500 mJy from 2008.0 to 2012.0. Follow-up interferometric continuum images from theVery Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz of this new continuum component determined it to be located at the nucleus of NGC 660. Subsequent High Sensitivity Array (HSA) line and continuum VLBI observations of the NGC 660 nucleus revealed a morphology that appears to be consistent with rapidly-precessing, mildly-relativistic jets from the central black hole. While requiring detailed modeling, this strongly suggests that the outburst is due to nuclear activity. From its time-scale, the shape of the continuum light-curve, and the milliarcsec radio structure, the most likely cause of the outburst is AGN-type activity of accretion of a gas cloud onto the central black hole.

  Aims. We present an extensive catalog of the physical properties of more than a million galaxies within the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), one of the largest spectroscopic surveys to date. Spanning over a full variety of target types, including emission line galaxies and luminous red galaxies as well as quasars, our survey encompasses an unprecedented range of spectroscopic redshifts, stretching from 0 to 6.   Methods. The physical properties, such as stellar masses and star formation rates, are derived via the CIGALE spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code accounting for the contribution coming from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Based on the modeling of the optical-mid-infrared (grz complemented by WISE photometry) SEDs, we study galaxy properties with respect to their location on the main sequence.   Results. We revise the dependence of stellar mass estimates on model choices and availability of the WISE photometry. The WISE information is mandatory to minimize the misclassification of star-forming galaxies as AGN. The lack of WISE bands in SED fits leads to elevated AGN fractions for 68% of star-forming galaxies identified using emission line diagnostic diagram but does not significantly affect their stellar mass nor star formation estimates.

  Relativistic plasmas in strong electromagnetic fields exhibit distinct properties compared to classical plasmas. In astrophysical environments, such as neutron stars, white dwarfs, AGNs, and shocks, relativistic plasmas are pervasive and are expected to play a crucial role in the dynamics of these systems. Despite their significance, both experimental and theoretical studies of such plasmas have been limited. Here, we present the first ab initio high-resolution kinetic simulations of relativistic plasmas undergoing synchrotron cooling in a highly magnetized medium. Our results demonstrate that these plasmas spontaneously generate coherent linearly polarised radiation (independently of the electron/positron ratio), in a wide range of parameters, via the electron cyclotron maser instability, with radiative losses altering the saturation of this instability. This enables the plasma to continously amplify coherent radiation for significantly longer durations of time. These findings highlight fundamental differences in the behaviour of relativistic plasmas in strongly magnetized environments and align with astronomical phenomena, such as pulsar emission and Fast Radio Bursts.

  The scenario of feedback-free starbursts (FFB), which predicts excessively bright galaxies at cosmic dawn as observed using JWST, may provide a natural setting for black hole (BH) growth. This involves the formation of intermediate-mass seed BHs and their runaway mergers into super-massive BHs with high BH-to-stellar mass ratios and low AGN luminosities. We present a scenario of merger-driven BH growth in FFB galaxies and study its feasibility. BH seeds form within the building blocks of the FFB galaxies, namely, thousands of compact star clusters, each starbursting in a free-fall time of a few Myr before the onset of stellar and supernova feedback. The BH seeds form by rapid core collapse in the FFB clusters, in a few free-fall times, sped up by the migration of massive stars due to the young, broad stellar mass function and stimulated by a `gravo-gyro' instability due to internal cluster rotation and flattening. BHs of $10^4 M_\odot$ are expected in $10^6 M_\odot$ FFB clusters within sub-kpc galactic disks at $z \sim 10$. The BHs then migrate to the galaxy center by dynamical friction, hastened by the compact FFB stellar galactic disk configuration. Efficient mergers of the BH seeds will produce $10^{6-8} M_\odot$ BHs with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio $\sim 0.01$ by $z \sim 4-7$, as observed. The growth of the central BH by mergers can overcome the bottleneck introduced by gravitational wave recoils if the BHs inspiral within a relatively cold disk or if the escape velocity from the galaxy is boosted by a wet compaction event. Such events, common in massive galaxies at high redshifts, can also help by speeding up the inward BH migration and by providing central gas to assist with the final parsec problem. The cold disk version of the FFB scenario provides a feasible route for the formation of supermassive BHs.

  The gravitational wave (GW) event GW190521, likely originating from a binary black hole (BBH) merger within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, is associated with the optical flare ZTF19abanrhr. The remnant BHs from BBH mergers can launch the jet and outflow and then interact with the disk medium, which can be responsible for the associated electromagnetic radiations. In this \textit{letter}, we examine the shock breakout and subsequent cooling emissions from four potential components: the outflow, jet head, jet cocoon, and disk cocoon, all driven by the remnant BH within the AGN disk. Using dynamic models and observational constraints, for GW190521, we identify the parameter space for each component and conclude that either the outflow or the disk cocoon could produce the observed electromagnetic signal, with the disk cocoon requiring more extreme parameters. We present best-fit light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for both components, showing peak emissions in the UV band for the outflow and spanning optical to UV for the disk cocoon.

  (abridged) Accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at close to the Eddington rate can influence the host galaxy via powerful winds. Theoretical models of such winds can explain observational correlations between SMBHs and their host galaxies and the powerful multi-phase outflows observed in a number of active galaxies. Analytic models usually assume spherical symmetry and a smooth gas distribution with an adiabatic equation of state. However, the interstellar medium in real galaxies is clumpy and cooling is important, complicating the analysis. We used a suite of idealised hydrodynamical simulations to isolate the effects of turbulence and cooling on the development and global properties of AGN wind-driven outflows on kiloparsec scales. We measured the outflow velocity, mass outflow rate and momentum and energy loading factors as the system evolved over 1.2 Myr and estimated plausible observationally derived values.   We find that adiabatic simulations approximately reproduce the analytical estimates of outflow properties independently of turbulence or clumpiness. However, cooling reduces the outflow energy rate by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the smooth simulations and by up to one order of magnitude in the turbulent ones. The interplay between cooling and turbulence depends on AGN luminosity: in Eddington-limited AGN, turbulence enhances the coupling between the AGN wind and the gas, while the opposite happens in lower-luminosity simulations. This occurs because dense gas clumps are resilient to low-luminosity AGN feedback but get driven away by high-luminosity AGN feedback. The overall properties of multi-phase outflowing gas in our simulations qualitatively agree with observations of multi-phase outflows. We also find that using `observable' outflow properties leads to their parameters being underestimated by a factor of a few compared with real values.   

"Little Red Dots" cannot reside in the same dark matter halos as

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of candidate broad-line AGN emerging in the early Universe, named ''little red dots'' (LRDs) because of their compactness and red colors at optical wavelengths. LRDs appear to be surprisingly abundant ($\approx 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-3}$) given that their inferred bolometric luminosities largely overlap with the ones of the UV-luminous quasars identified at high $z$ in wide-field spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we investigate how the population of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of unobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer an extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from $\approx20:1$ at $z\approx4$ to $\approx2300:1$ at $z\approx7$, and possibly extending out to very high ($\approx10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) bolometric luminosities. This large obscured:unobscured ratio is incompatible with the UV-luminous duty cycle measured for unobscured quasars at $z\approx4-6$, suggesting that LRDs are too abundant to be hosted by the same halos as unobscured quasars. This implies that either (a) the bolometric luminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated (possibly because LRDs are dominated by stellar galaxy light) or (b) LRDs follow different scaling relations than the ones of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population of accreting SMBHs emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between the clustering of LRDs and the one of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately confirm these findings, and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their host mass distribution and duty cycle. We provide a mock analysis for the clustering of LRDs and show that it is feasible with current and upcoming JWST surveys.   

Gravitational Wave Forecasts Constrained by JWST AGN Observations for

  Massive black holes (BHs) grow by gas accretion and mergers, observable through electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) emission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), revealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of $M_\bullet\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of space-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted mass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings to investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of seed BHs are considered: heavy seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{2-5}~M_\odot$) formed in rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{1-3}~M_\odot$) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter halos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we model by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including JWST-identified AGNs at $z\sim 5$. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to explain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more abundant light seeds. The observed merger rate of BHs from heavy seeds alone is limited to $\lesssim 10^{-1}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for major mergers at $z\geq5$. However, the presence of light seeds increases the major merger rate by several orders of magnitude, which peaks at a total BH mass of $M_\bullet\simeq 2\times 10^3~M_\odot$ over $5&lt;z&lt;10$ at a rate of $\sim 30~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. These events are detectable by future GW observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Precise sky localization and distance measurement of those GW events, with solid angle and luminosity distance uncertainties $\Delta\Omega\Delta\log D_L\lesssim 10^{-4}~\rm deg^2$, will enable EM identification of mergers at $z\geq5$ and multi-messenger follow-up observations.   

Red giant - jet collisions in galactic nuclei I: 3D hydrodynamical model

  Several models have been proposed to explain missing red giants (RGs) near the Galactic centre. Recently, a scenario has been suggested that predicts, among other processes, a long-term ablation of the surface layers of RGs during their repetitive passages through the Galactic jet (Zaja\v{c}ek et al., 2020). In this study, we perform detailed three-dimensional numerical modelling of this phenomenon. We calculate the ablation rate of the surface layers of a RG orbiting the supermassive black hole (SMBH) as it passes through the nuclear jet. In particular, we model the jet-star interaction for approximately 10 passages for the closer orbital distance of $10^{-3}\,\text{pc}$ and 2 passages for $10^{-2}\,\text{pc}$. We find that the mass loss due to ablation by the jet behaves with time as $\Delta M_{\star}\propto \sqrt{t}$ and the total ablated mass during a single active galactic nucleus (AGN) phase ($10^5$ years) is $\sim 10^4\,M_{\odot}$. We arrive at similar rates of the stellar ablation for the relatively smaller jet luminosity $10^{42}\,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ as in the previous analytical calculations. For larger jet luminosities of $10^{44}$ and $10^{48}\,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$, the ablation rates inferred from $\sim 10$ interactions as well as extrapolated power-law fits are significantly lower than analytical values. For the smallest orbital distance of $10^{-3}\,\text{pc}$, we also track the thermal behaviour of the stellar surface layer, whose temperature appears to grow rapidly during the first 10 passages from $\sim 3600\,{\rm K}$ (spectral type M) to $\sim 8500\,{\rm K}$ (spectral type A). RG-jet interactions can thus lead to observable changes in the nuclear late-type stellar population.

  Mature radio galaxies such as M87 belong to a specific subclass of active galaxies (AGN) whose evolution in time endows them with five distinguishing characteristics, including (1) low excitation emission, (2) low star formation rates, (3) high bulge stellar-velocity dispersion, (4) bright stellar nuclei, and (5) weak or nonexistent merger signatures. We show how to understand these seemingly disparate characteristics as originating from the time evolution of powerful radio quasars and describe a new model prediction that tilted accretion disks in AGN are expected to occur in bright quasars but not in other subclasses of AGN. The picture we present should be understood as the most compelling evidence for counter-rotation as a key element in feedback from accreting black holes.

  We analyze the Spitzer spectra of 140 active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected in the hard X-rays (14-195 keV) by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Swift. This sample allows us to probe several orders of magnitude in black hole masses ($10^6-10^9 M_{\odot}$), Eddington ratios ($10^{-3}-1$), X-ray luminosities ($10^{42}-10^{45}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$), and X-ray column densities ($10^{20}-10^{24}\rm\,cm^{-2}$). The AGN emission is expected to be the dominant source of ionizing photons with energies $\gtrsim50$ eV, and therefore high-ionization mid-infrared (MIR) emission lines such as [Ne V] 14.32, 24.32 $\mu$m and [O IV] 25.89 $\mu$m are predicted to be good proxies of AGN activity, and robust against obscuration effects. We find high detection rates ($\gtrsim85-90$ per cent) for the mid-infrared coronal emission lines in our AGN sample. The luminosities of these lines are correlated with the 14-150 keV luminosity (with a typical scatter of $\sigma \sim 0.4-0.5$ dex), strongly indicating that the mid-infrared coronal line emission is driven by AGN activity. Interestingly, we find that the coronal lines are more tightly correlated to the bolometric luminosity ($\sigma \sim 0.2-0.3$ dex), calculated from careful analysis of the spectral energy distribution, than to the X-ray luminosity. We find that the relationship between the coronal line strengths and $L_{14-150\rm\,keV}$ is independent of black hole mass, Eddington ratio and X-ray column density. This confirms that the mid-infrared coronal lines can be used as unbiased tracers of the AGN power for X-ray luminosities in the $10^{42}-10^{45}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ range.

  We present Gemini near-infrared integral field spectrograph (NIFS) K-band observations of the central 400 pc of NGC 1266, a nearby (D$\approx$30 Mpc) post-starburst galaxy with a powerful multi-phase outflow and a shocked ISM. We detect 7 H$_2$ ro-vibrational emission lines excited thermally to $T$$\sim$2000 K, and weak Br$\gamma$ emission, consistent with a fast C-shock. With these bright H$_2$ lines, we observe the spatial structure of the shock with an unambiguous tracer for the first time. The Br$\gamma$ emission is concentrated in the central $\lesssim$100 pc, indicating that any remaining star-formation in NGC 1266 is in the nucleus while the surrounding cold molecular gas has little on-going star-formation. Though it is unclear what fraction of this Br$\gamma$ emission is from star-formation or the AGN, assuming it is entirely due to star-formation we measure an instantaneous star-formation rate of 0.7 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, though the star-formation rate may be significantly higher in the presence of additional extinction. NGC 1266 provides a unique laboratory to study the complex interactions between AGN, outflows, shocks, and star-formation, all of which are necessary to unravel the evolution of the post-starburst phase.

  A major unsolved problem in galaxy evolution is the early appearance of massive quiescent galaxies that no longer actively form stars only $ \sim 1$ billion years after the Big Bang. Their high stellar masses and extremely compact structure indicate that they formed through rapid bursts of star formation between redshift $z \sim 6-11$. Theoretical models of galaxy evolution cannot explain their high number density, rapid growth and truncation of star formation at such early times, which likely requires extreme feedback to destroy the cold interstellar medium (the fuel for star formation). We report the discovery of a significant reservoir of hot dust in one of the most distant known examples at $z = 4.658$, GS-9209. The dust was identified using JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), whose unprecedented sensitivity and high spatial resolution, for the first time, firmly show that this dust is significantly more extended than the stars by $\gtrsim 3$ times. We find that the dust has preferentially been evacuated or diluted in the galaxy center. Our analysis finds that the extended hot dust emission is consistent with recent heating by a younger and more spatially extended generation of star formation. This reveals that the earliest quiescent galaxies did not form in a single rapid burst; instead, similar to galaxy growth at later times, the center formed first with star formation continuing in an extended envelope. The growth of this galaxy is truncating from the inside out, consistent with central gas depletion from early AGN feedback.
