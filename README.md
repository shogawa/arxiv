  We present the first catalog of targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift, and CW frequency, our strain and chirp mass upper limits are on average 2.6$\times$ more constraining than sky-averaged limits. Bayesian model comparisons against a common uncorrelated red noise for the gravitational wave background (GWB) disfavor a CW signal for almost all targets, yielding a mean Bayes factor of $0.87 \pm 0.31$. There are two notable exceptions: SDSS J153636.22+044127.0, ``Rohan'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 3.37(5)$, and SDSS J072908.71+400836.6, ``Gondor'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 2.44(3)$. These Bayes factors correspond to p-values of $0.01$--$0.03$ ($1.9\sigma$--$2.3\sigma$) and $0.05$--$0.08$ ($1.4\sigma$--$1.6\sigma$), respectively, depending on the empirical null distribution. We outline the beginnings of a detection protocol by identifying and carrying out a battery of tests on Rohan and Gondor to verify their binary nature. Notably, when replacing the common uncorrelated red noise model with a Hellings--Downs correlated GWB, Rohan's Bayes factor drops to $1.25(7)$, while Gondor's increases to $3.2(1)$. Both have rich electromagnetic datasets, including optical and infrared variability and spectroscopic features that support their classification as SMBHB candidates, though this was discovered after the targeted searches were complete. Our results suggest more simulations are needed to confirm or refute the nature of these and future SMBHB candidates, while creating a roadmap for targeted CW detection.

  The detection of very-high-energy (VHE; $&gt;$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray radiation from misaligned jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) challenges the emission models that primarily explain VHE emissions from beamed AGN, i.e., blazars. Using over 16 years of \textit{Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (\textit{Fermi}-LAT) Pass 8 data in the energy range 0.1$-$2 TeV, we systematically explore the VHE emission from a recently published sample of 160 radio galaxies. We identify 12 sources detected at $&gt;4\sigma$ confidence level (test statistic or TS$&gt;$16), including nine with TS$&gt;$25 and two Fanaroff-Riley type II objects. This detected sample includes seven out of eight previously known VHE objects. Two radio galaxies are detected in the VHE band for the first time, and we identify three promising candidates with 16$&lt;$TS$&lt;$25. Additionally, 13 objects are identified as candidate VHE emitters with at least one VHE photon detected with the \textit{Fermi}-LAT. These findings expand the sample of known VHE-emitting radio galaxies, whose multiwavelength follow-up observations can help provide insights into the emission mechanisms, jet physics, and the contribution of misaligned AGN to the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background.

  We present the results from performing spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on 121 variable active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) using photometry from both the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) covering $0.2 - 4.8$ microns. We designed a bespoke SED fitting code which decomposes the total SED into its stellar and AGN contributions. Our SED fitting retrieves a significant contribution to the total SED from an AGN template for 26 of our variable sources with $0 &lt; z &lt; 7$. We leverage the model AGN spectrum to estimate black hole masses ($M_{BH}$) using the measured luminosity at 5100 \r{A} and local empirical calibrations. Common with recently discovered JWST broad line AGN (BL-AGN), we observe a trend in the $M_{BH} - M_{\ast}$ plane where low redshift sources have $M_{BH}$ which agree with local relations while high redshift sources have increasingly overmassive black holes with respect to the stellar mass ($M_{\ast}$) of their host galaxies. Within our sample, we identify two IMBH candidates hosted by dwarf galaxies at $z&lt;1$ featuring overmassive BHs in the $M_{BH}-M_{\ast}$ plane, similarly to our high redshift sources. Finally, our SED fitter successfully retrieves the AGN nature of one source at $z &gt;6$. This object has $z_{phot} = 6.74$ and we estimate a lower limit on its black hole mass of $\log_{10}(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 7.36$.
