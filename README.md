  We present a comprehensive study of the star formation histories of massive-quenched galaxies at $z=3$ in 3 semi-analytic models (SHARK, GAEA, GALFORM) and 3 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, Illustris-TNG, Simba). We study the predicted number density and stellar mass function of massive-quenched galaxies, their formation and quenching timescales and star-formation properties of their progenitors. Predictions are disparate in all these diagnostics, for instance: (i) some simulations reproduce the observed number density of very massive-quenched galaxies ($&gt;10^{11}\rm M_{\odot}$) but underpredict the high density of intermediate-mass ones, while others fit well the lower masses but underpredict the higher ones; (ii) In most simulations, except for GAEA and EAGLE, most massive-quenched galaxies had starburst periods, with the most intense ones happening at $4&lt;z&lt;5$; however, only in SHARK and Illustris-TNG we do find a large number of progenitors with star formation rates $&gt;300\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$; (iii) quenching timescales are in the range $\approx 20-150$~Myr depending on the simulation; among other differences. These disparate predictions can be tied to the adopted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback model. For instance, the explicit black-hole (BH) mass dependence to trigger the "radio mode" in Illustris-TNG and Simba makes it difficult to produce quenched galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, also leading to higher baryon collapse efficiencies ($\approx 15-30$%); while the strong bolometric luminosity dependence of the AGN outflow rate in GAEA leads to BHs of modest mass quenching galaxies. Current observations are unable to distinguish between these different predictions due to the small sample sizes. However, these predictions are testable with current facilities and upcoming observations, allowing a "true physics experiment" to be carried out.

  Dual Active Galactic Nuclei (dual AGNs), a phase in some galaxy mergers during which both central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are active, are expected to be a key observable stage leading up to SMBH mergers. Constraining the population of dual AGNs in both the nearby and high-z universe has proven to be elusive until very recently. We present a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign to confirm the nature of a sample of 20 candidate dual AGNs at cosmic noon (z~2) from the VODKA sample. Through a combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Very Large Array (VLA) imaging, we refute the possibility of gravitational lensing in all but one target. We find evidence of dual AGNs in four systems, while seven exhibit single AGN in galaxy pairs, either through strong radio emission or ancillary emission line data. The remaining systems are either confirmed as quasar-star superpositions (six) or non-lensed pairs (two) that require further investigations to establish AGN activity. Among the systems with radio detections, we find a variety of radio spectral slopes and UV/optical colors suggesting that our sample contains a range of AGN properties, from obscured radio-quiet objects to those with powerful synchrotron-emitting jets. This study presents one of the largest dedicated multi-wavelength follow-up campaigns to date searching for dual AGNs at high redshift. We confirm several of the highest-z systems at small physical separations, thus representing some of the most evolved dual AGN systems at the epoch of peak quasar activity known to date.

  We infer supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates and Eddington ratios as a function of SMBH/host galaxy mass and redshift with the empirical TRINITY model of dark matter halo--galaxy--SMBH connection. The galaxy--SMBH mass and growth rate connection from TRINITY is constrained by galaxy observables from $0&lt;z&lt;13$ and SMBH observables from $0&lt;z&lt;6.5$. Key findings include: 1) the ratio between cosmic SMBH accretion rate and galaxy star formation rate stays constant at $\sim 2\times 10^{-3}$ from $z=0-4$, and decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from $z=4-10$; 2) the average SMBH Eddington ratio $\overline{\eta}$ increases towards higher redshifts, nearly reaching $\overline{\eta}=1$ at $z\sim 10$; 3) at fixed redshift for $z&lt;3$, SMBHs/galaxies with higher masses have lower $\overline{\eta}$, consistent with AGN downsizing; 4) the average ratio of specific SMBH accretion rate ($\overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}$) to average specific star formation rate ($\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}$) is nearly mass-independent, with a value $\overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}/\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}\sim 1$, which decreases slightly from $z=10$ to $z=0$; 5) similar to galaxies, SMBHs reach their peak efficiency to convert baryons into mass when host halos reach $10^{12} M_\odot$; 6) given galaxy and SMBH growth histories from TRINITY, the local descendants of $1&lt;z&lt;11$ overmassive JWST AGNs will remain outliers from the local SMBH mass--galaxy mass relation. These findings combine to give a simple explanation for massive ($10^9-10^{10}M_\odot$) quasars at $z&gt;6$: at these redshifts, dark matter halos experience $\sim$Eddington specific growth rates, driving $\sim$Eddington specific growth rates in both galaxies and SMBHs.

  Extreme continuum variability in AGNs can indicate extreme changes in accretion flows onto supermassive black holes. We explore the multiwavelength nature of a continuum flare in the Seyfert LCRS B040659.9$-$385922. The all-sky X-ray surveys conducted by the eROSITA showed that its X-ray flux increased by a factor of roughly five over six months, and concurrent optical photometric monitoring with the ATLAS showed a simultaneous increase. We triggered a multiwavelength follow-up monitoring program (XMM, NICER; optical spectroscopy) to study the evolution of the accretion disk, broad-line region, and X-ray corona. During the campaign, X-ray and optical continuum flux subsided over roughly six months. We detected a soft X-ray excess near the flare peak and after it subsided, both exhibiting a power-law (nonthermal) behavior. We modeled the broadband optical/UV/X-ray spectral energy distribution at both the flare peak and post-flare times with the AGNSED model, incorporating thermal disk emission into the optical/UV and warm thermal Comptonization in the soft X-rays. Additionally, we find that the broad Heii $\lambda$4686 emission line fades significantly as the optical/UV/X-ray continuum fades, which could indicate a substantial flare of disk emission above 54 eV. We also observed a redshifted broad component in the H${\beta}$ emission line that is present during the high flux state of the source and disappears in subsequent observations. We witnessed a likely sudden strong increase in local accretion rate, which manifested itself via an increase in accretion disk emission and thermal Comptonization emission in the soft X-rays, followed by a decrease in accretion and Comptonized luminosity. The physical processes leading to such substantial variations are still an open question, and future continuous monitoring along with multi-wavelength studies will shed some light on it.

  Relativistic magnetized jets, originating near black holes, are observed to exhibit sub-structured flows. In this study, we present synthetic synchrotron emission signatures for different lines of sight and frequencies, derived from three-dimensional relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of pc-scale AGN jets. These simulations apply different injection nozzles, injecting steady, variable, and precessing jets. Extending our previous study, here, we have developed a bridge to connect jet dynamics and particle acceleration within relativistic shocks with non-thermal radiation dominant in jets. The emission is derived from Lagrangian particles - injected into the jet and following the fluid - accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration and subsequently cooled by emitting energy via synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes. Overall, the different shocks structures lead to the formation of numerous localized emission patterns - interpreted as jet knots. These knot patterns can fade or flare, also as a consequence of merging or Doppler boosting, leading to jet variability. We find knots with high-enough pattern speed supposed to be visible as superluminal motion &lt;~5c. Synchrotron spectra of all jets reveal double-humped structures, reflecting multiple electron populations characterized by the nature of underlying shock and their age. The precessing jet is the most powerful emitter, featuring a spectrum flatter than the steady and the variable jet. The emission, although essentially governed by the acceleration through shocks, depends on the cooling history of the particle as well. Overall, the continuous re-acceleration of electrons through shocks along the jet we found, is an essential prerequisite for observing extended jet emission over large time-scales and length-scales.

  To address the discrepancy where disk sizes exceed those predicted by standard models, we explore two extensions to disk size estimates within the UV/optical wavelength range: disk winds and color correction. We provide detailed, self-consistent derivations and analytical formulas, including those based on a power-law temperature approximation, offering efficient tools for analyzing observational data. Applying our model to four type I AGNs with intensive reverberation mapping observations, we find a shallower temperature slope ($T\propto R^{-0.66}$, compared to $R^{-3/4}$ traditionally) and a color correction factor ($f_{\rm col} \approx 1.6$), consistent with previous studies. We observe a positive correlation between accretion rate and color correction with black hole mass. However, the small sample size limits our conclusions. The strong degeneracy between the temperature slope and accretion rate suggests that incorporating flux spectra or spectral energy distributions could improve fitting accuracy. Our simulation approach offers a rapid and effective method for reverberation mapping.

  We investigate the kinematics and dynamics of the molecular and ionized gas in the host galaxies of three Palomar-Green quasars at low redshifts, benefiting from the archival millimeter-wave interferometric and optical integral field unit data. We study the kinematics of both cold molecular and hot ionized gas by analyzing the CO and H$\alpha$ data cubes, and construct the mass distributions of our sample through gas dynamics, utilizing a priori knowledge regarding the galaxy light distribution. We find no systematic offset between the stellar mass derived from our dynamical method and that from the broad-band photometry and mass-to-light ratio, suggesting the consistency of both methods. We then study the kinetic pressure and the weight of the interstellar medium using our dynamical mass model. By studying the relationship between kinetic pressure and gravitational pressure of the quasar host galaxies, we find an equivalence in the hydrostatic equilibrium states of ISM in the quasar host galaxies, similar to the result of gas equilibrium in normal star-forming galaxies, suggesting minimal quasar feedback. Regarding non-circular motion as indicative of quasar-driven outflows, we observe an exceptionally low coupling efficiency between molecular gas outflow and AGN bolometric luminosities. These results demonstrate the marginal influence of the central engine on the properties of cold molecular gas in quasar host galaxies.

  The wide fields of view, high sensitivity, and broad energy coverage of current X-ray and gamma-ray satellites, coupled with the high cadence observational strategy of some of them (recently Swift and Fermi) have been ideal for carrying out unprecedented studies of the variability properties of different classes of Galactic and extra-Galactic high-energy sources. These classes of objects range from nearby flaring stars to the most distant Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper we focus on some of the most energetic events, i.e. those powered by accretion (black hole binaries, ultra-luminous X-rays and Active Galactic Nuclei) until those leading to the first detections of GravitationalWaves (GWs), i.e. the Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), passing through the controversial Inter-Mediate Mass Black-Holes (IMBHs). We show the importance of X-ray and gamma-ray emission for the determination of the properties (mass, spin, inclination, height of the corona) of the compact objects residing in systems powered by accretion and the role of the LIGO and VIRGO interferometers in the case of the (compact objects) binary mergers. Gravitational waves allow the determination of the properties of the non-light-emitting compact objects (black-holes; BHs) in binary mergers (BH-BH) that otherwise would be nearly impossible. We show that for the case of neutron star (NS) mergers (NS-BH or NS-NS) electro-magnetic (EM) emission is still possible, and very powerful, being the responsible for the X-ray and gamma-ray emission of many GRBs (kilonovae). Very recently these transients have been discovered to show X-ray and gamma-ray variability patterns that could lead to very important insights into the properties of the binary mergers that originated them, opening a new view for their study.

  The relative contribution of emission from stellar sources and accretion onto supermassive black holes to reionization has been brought into focus again by the apparent high abundance of faint AGN at $4\lesssim z\lesssim11$ uncovered by JWST. We investigate the contribution of these faint AGN to hydrogen and the early stages of helium reionization using the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE by post-processing a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the SHERWOOD-RELICS suite of simulations. We study four models of reionization: two previously studied galaxy-only late-end reionization models and two new models -- a QSO-assisted model and a QSO-only model. In the QSO-assisted model, 1\% of the haloes host AGN with a 10~Myr lifetime, and the AGN luminosities are scaled such that the AGN contribution to the hydrogen-ionizing emissivity is 20\% of that contributed by galaxies. In the QSO-only model, quasars account for all the hydrogen-ionizing emissivity, with 10\% of the haloes hosting AGN, each with a 10 Myr lifetime. All models are calibrated to the observed mean Lyman-$\alpha$ forest transmission at $5\lesssim z\lesssim6.2$. We find that the QSO-assisted model requires an emissivity factor of $1.8$ lower than the galaxy-only models towards the end of reionization and fits the observed distribution of the Lyman-$\alpha$ optical depths well. Our QSO-only model is inconsistent with the observed Lyman-$\alpha$ optical depths distribution. It also results in too high IGM temperatures at $z\lesssim 5$ due to an early onset of HeII reionization unless the escape fraction of HeII-ionizing photons is assumed to be low. Our results suggest that a modest contribution to reionization by faint AGN is in good agreement with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. In contrast, a scenario dominated by faint AGN appears difficult to reconcile with these observations.

  Cosmic rays may be dynamically very important in driving large-scale galactic winds. Edge-on galaxies give us an outsider's view of the radio halo, which shows the presence of extra-planar cosmic-ray electrons and magnetic fields. We present a new radio continuum imaging study of the nearby edge-on galaxy NGC 4217 in order to study the distribution of extra-planar cosmic rays and magnetic fields. We both observe with the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) in the S-band (2-4 GHz) and with LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) at 144 MHz. We measure vertical intensity profiles and exponential scale heights. We re-image both JVLA and LOFAR data at matched angular resolution in order to measure radio spectral indices between 144 MHz and 3 GHz. Confusing point-like sources were subtracted prior to imaging. Intensity profiles are then fitted with cosmic-ray electron advection models, where we use an isothermal wind model that is driven by a combination of pressure from the hot gas and cosmic rays. We discover a large-scale radio halo on one (northwestern) side of the galactic disc. The morphology is reminiscent of a bubble extending up to 20 kpc away from the disc. We find spectral ageing in the bubble which allows us to measure advection speeds of the cosmic-ray electrons accelerating from 300 to 600 $\rm km\, s^{-1}$ . Assuming energy equipartition between the cosmic rays and the magnetic field, we estimate the bubble can be inflated by a modest 10 per cent of the kinetic energy injected by supernovae over its dynamical time-scale of 35 Myr. While no active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been detected, such activity in the recent past cannot be ruled out. Non-thermal bubbles with sizes of tens of kiloparsec may be a ubiquitous feature of star-forming galaxies showing the influence of feedback. To determine possible contributions by AGN feedback, will require deeper observations.

  Many science cases for wide-field time-domain surveys rely on accurate identification and characterization of the galaxies hosting transient and variable objects. In the era of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory the number of known transient and variable sources will grow by orders of magnitude, and many of these sources will be blended with their host galaxies and neighboring galaxies. A diverse range of applications - including the classification of nuclear and non-nuclear sources, identification of potential host galaxies, extraction of host galaxy SEDs without requiring a transient-free reference image, and combined analysis of photometry from multiple surveys - will benefit from a flexible framework to model time-domain imaging of transients. We describe a time-domain extension of the Scarlet2 scene modeling code for multi-epoch, multi-band, and multi-resolution imaging data to extract simultaneous transient and host galaxy models. Scarlet2 leverages the benefits of data-driven priors on galaxy morphology, is fully GPU compatible, and can jointly model multi-resolution data from ground and space-based surveys. We demonstrate the method on simulated LSST-like supernova imaging, low-resolution Zwicky Transient Facility imaging of tidal disruption events, and Hyper Suprime Cam imaging of variable AGN out to z = 4 in the COSMOS fields. We show that Scarlet2 models provide accurate transient and host galaxy models as well as accurate measurement of host-transient spatial offsets, and demonstrate future applications to the search for 'wandering' massive black holes.

  Dark Matter (DM) remains poorly probed on critical, sub-galactic scales, where predictions from different models diverge in terms of abundance and density profiles of halos. Gravitational lens systems on milli-arcsecond scales (milli-lenses) are expected for a population of dense DM halos, or free-floating supermassive black holes (SMBHs), that might be comprised of primordial black holes (PBHs), in the mass range of $10^6$ to $10^9 M_\odot$. In this paper, we aim to look for milli-lens systems via a systematic search in a large sample of radio-loud AGN observed with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the observational strategy to discriminate milli-lenses from contaminant objects mimicking a milli-lens morphology. In a pilot project, we have investigated VLBI images from 13,828 sources from the Astrogeo VLBI image database and reduced the number of candidates to 40 in a first step. We present here the images and analysis of sensitive follow-up observations with the EVN at 5 and 22 GHz, and streamline our analysis to reject milli-lens candidates. Using constraints such as the surface brightness ratio, conservation of spectral shape, stability of flux ratios over time, and changes in morphology, we can confidently discriminate between milli-lenses and their mimickers. Using the above constraints, we rule out 32 out of our initial 40 candidates as milli-lenses, demonstrating the power of our approach. Also, we find many new candidates for compact symmetric objects, that are thought to be short-lived, jetted radio sources. This serves as a pathfinder for the final sample used for the SMILE (Search for MIlli-LEnses) project, which will allow us to constrain DM models by comparing the results to theoretical predictions. This SMILE sample will consist of $\sim$5,000 sources based on the VLA CLASS survey, including many observations obtained for this project specifically.

  Large Array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (LACT) is an array of 32 Cherenkov telescopes with 6-meter diameter mirrors to be constructed at the LHAASO site. In this work, we present a study on the layout optimization and performance analysis of LACT. We investigate two observation modes: large zenith angle observations for ultra-high energy events and small zenith angle observations for lower energy thresholds. For large zenith angles (60{\deg}), simulations show that an 8-telescope subarray can achieve an effective area of $3 ~\rm km^2$ and excellent angular resolution. For small zenith angles, we optimize the layout of 4-telescope cells and the full 32-telescope array. The threshold of the full array is about $200~\rm GeV$, which is particularly crucial for studying transient phenomena, including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This study provides important guidance for the final LACT layout design and performance estimates under different observational conditions, demonstrating LACT's potential for deep observations of ultra-high energy \gray sources and morphological studies of PeVatrons, as well as time-domain \gray astronomy.

  We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray spectral properties of 198 newly identified active galactic nuclei (AGNs), leveraging archival data from the {\it Chandra} X-ray Observatory. All these AGNs exhibit a powerlaw spectral signature spanning a broad energy range of $0.5-7.0$ keV, characterized by the photon index ($\Gamma$) values ranging from $0.3^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ to $2.54^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$. Particularly, 76 of these AGNs display discernible levels of intrinsic absorption, after considering the Galactic absorption. The column densities associated with this local absorption ($n_{\rm H}^{\rm local}$) are within a range of $\sim 10^{19} - 10^{22}\ {\rm cm^{-2}}$. We study the cosmological evolution of AGNs using the variation of $n_{\rm H}^{\rm local}$ and $\Gamma$ with their estimated redshift. The intrinsic spectral signature did not reveal any significant cosmological evolution; however, a deficit of hard sources at high redshift is possibly intrinsic. Our sample covers several decades of broadband intrinsic luminosity ($L_{\rm B}^{\rm intr}$) ranging from $4.59^{+0.41}_{-0.41} \times 10^{42}$ to $2.4^{+0.12}_{-0.12} \times 10^{46}\, {\rm erg~s}^{-1}$ with peak at 1.84 redshift. We also investigate the hardness-luminosity diagram (HLD) to further probe the AGNs. We conduct a sanity check by applying our findings to known AGNs, and the results are consistent with our observations.

  We introduce the construction of polarized intensity cubes $P$(RA, Dec, $\Phi$) and their visualization as movies, as a powerful technique for interpreting Faraday structure. $P$ is constructed from maps of peak polarized intensity P(RA, Dec) with their corresponding Faraday depth maps $\Phi$(RA, Dec). We illustrate the extensive scientific potential of such visualizations with a variety of science use cases from ASKAP and MeerKAT, presenting models that are consistent with the data but not necessarily unique. We demonstrate how one can, in principle, distinguish between cube structures which originate from unrelated foreground screens from those due to magnetized plasmas local to the emitting source. Other science use cases illustrate how variations in the local $n_e$ $B$, and line-of-sight distance to the synchrotron emitting regions can be distinguished using Faraday rotation. We show, for the first time, how the line-of-sight orientation of AGN jets can be determined. We also examine the case of M87 to show how internal jet magnetic field configurations can be identified, and extend earlier results. We recommend using this technique to re-evaluate all previous analyses of polarized sources that are well-resolved both spatially and in Faraday depth. Recognizing the subjective nature of interpretations at this early stage, we also highlight the need and utility for further scientific and technical developments.

  Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a previously hidden population of extremely bright and compact objects between redshifts of $z \sim 4$ and $z \sim 10$. Given their extreme red colouring in the observed frame these galaxies have been dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs). The aim of this project was to identify LRDs using photometric data from previously uninvestigated JWST datasets and to estimate their AGN fractions by fitting the spectral energy distribution of each galaxy against well calibrated templates using CIGALE. We identified a list of potential LRDs using a single colour cut of F444W-F277W $&gt;$1.5 mag and by applying a morphological analysis. We used EAZY to estimate the (photometric) redshift and CIGALE to estimate the AGN fraction of each LRD. Overall, we identified 14 LRDs, applying accurate SED fits to 11 of them. We found that 7 of them had a high AGN fraction (with the AGN component generating more than 50\% of the observed flux), a further two LRDs had AGN contribution in excess of approximately 40\%. In total nine LRDs (our of 14) are likely to have a supermassive black hole in their centre. Interestingly, the three LRDs which could not be well fit by CIGALE displayed extremely high photometric redshifts ($z_{phot} \gtrsim 11$) and require further analysis (and may also host a supermassive black hole in their centre).   

Slow and steady does the trick: Slow outflows enhance the fragmentation

  Most massive galaxies host a supermassive black hole at their centre. Matter accretion creates an active galactic nucleus (AGN), forming a relativistic particle wind. The wind heats and pushes the interstellar medium, producing galactic-wide outflows. Fast outflows remove the gas from galaxies and quench star formation, and while slower ($v&lt;500$ km s$^{-1}$) outflows are ubiquitous, their effect is less clear but can be both positive and negative. We wish to understand the conditions required for positive feedback. We investigated the effect that slow and warm-hot outflows have on the dense gas clouds in the host galaxy. We aim to constrain the region of outflow and cloud parameter space, if any, where the passage of the outflow enhances star formation. We used numerical simulations of virtual `wind tunnels' to investigate the interaction of isolated turbulent spherical clouds ($10^{3;4;5}$ M$_{\odot}$) with slow outflows ($10$ km s$^{-1} - 400$ km s$^{-1}$) spanning a wide range of temperatures ($10^{4;5;6}$ K). We find that warm outflows compress the clouds and enhance gas fragmentation at velocities ${\leq}200$ km s$^{-1}$, while hot ($T_{\rm out} = 10^6$ K) outflows increase fragmentation rates even at moderate velocities of $400$ km s$^{-1}$. Cloud acceleration, on the other hand, is typically inefficient, with dense gas only attaining velocities of ${&lt;}0.1 v_{\rm out}$. We suggest three primary scenarios where positive feedback on star formation is viable: stationary cloud compression by slow outflows in low-powered AGN, sporadic enhancement in shear flow layers formed by luminous AGN, and self-compression in fragmenting AGN-driven outflows. Our results are consistent with current observational constraints and with previous works investigating triggered star formation in these disparate domains.

  A multitude of JWST studies reveal a surprising over-abundance of over-massive accreting super-massive blackholes (SMBHs) -- leading to a deepening tension between theory and observation in the first billion years of cosmic time. Across X-ray to infrared wavelengths, models built off of pre-JWST predictions fail to easily reproduce observed AGN signatures (or lack thereof), driving uncertainty around the true nature of these sources. Using a sample of JWST AGN identified via their broadened Halpha emission and covered by the deepest X-ray surveys, we find neither any measurable X-ray emission nor any detection of high-ionization emission lines frequently associated with accreting SMBHs. We propose that these sources are accreting at or beyond the Eddington limit, which reduces the need for efficient production of heavy SMBH seeds at cosmic dawn. Using a theoretical model of super-Eddington accretion, we can produce the observed relative dearth of both X-ray and ultraviolet emission, as well as the high Balmer decrements, without the need for significant dust attenuation. This work indicates that super-Eddington accretion is easily achieved through-out the early Universe, and further study is required to determine what environments are required to trigger this mode of black hole growth.

  It is now well known that certain massive galaxies undergo enormous enhancements in their SFR when they undergo major mergers(100x). To analyse the SF enhancement and AGN fraction evolution during the merger process, we use a more timeline-like merger sequence. Also, to determine the relation between the SF enhancement in mergers and the morphology of the galaxies involved. Taking advantage of the Mstr and SFR of 600 nearby isolated mergers from our previous study, we calculate the distance of our galaxies from the SF MS, which we refer to as SFmode. We analyse how the SFmode varies during the merger process, for morphology and Mstr. We also analyse the AGN content of our mergers, using multiple diagnostics based on emission line ratios and WISE colours. We observe that, overall, merging galaxies show a SFmode that is governed by their morphology. Spirals typically show high SFmode values while highly-disturbed galaxies are generally even more enhanced (0.8dex and 1dex above the MS, resp). On the contrary, elliptical and lenticular galaxies show the lowest SF modes, as expected. However, even they show SF enhancement compared to their unperturbed counterparts (their median SFmode is within the 1-sigma scatter of the MS, and this can occur even before the galaxies have coalesced). We see a trend for SFmode to gradually increase with increasing merger stage. We do not find a clear dependency of the observed AGN fraction on merger stage for the majority of our classification methods. We find mergers can significantly enhance SF in galaxies of all morphologies. For early-type galaxies, this could suggest that some gas was present prior to the merger which may be triggered to form stars by the tidal interaction. As the SF enhancement continues throughout the merger process, this suggests that the enhancement may be a long-lived event, contrary to the short starbursts seen in some models.

  We analyze the variability of the parsec-scale jet directions in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our analysis involves 317 AGNs at frequencies ranging from 2 to 43 GHz, and is made possible by developing an automatic inner jet direction measurement procedure. We find strong significant variations in a one quarter of these AGNs; the effect is likely ubiquitous, and not detected in the rest due to a limited sensitivity and observations epoch coverage. Average apparent jet rotation speeds range from 0.21 deg/yr at 2 GHz to 1.04 deg/yr at 43 GHz. This strong frequency dependence indicates that the variability cannot be explained by jet components propagating ballistically without acceleration: more complex jet shapes or patterns are required. Still, we demonstrate that the apparent direction changes are predominantly caused by the jet nozzle rotations, and not by individual components propagating transversely to the jet. In this work, we focus on variability scales much longer than the times of observations, that is &gt; 50 years. Using our measurements, we bound potential periods to less than 1000 years in the source rest frame for 90% AGNs in the sample. This allows us to constrain mechanisms causing these variations if they are periodic, such as instabilities, disk-driven precession, or binary black hole effects.
