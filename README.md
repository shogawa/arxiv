The revision of the fourth Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalog of gamma-ray point sources (rev4FGL) revealed that the gamma-ray sky is populated by emerging populations of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) other than blazars and radio galaxies. Narrow-Line Seyfert 1, Seyfert 1, intermediate, and Seyfert 2 galaxies, changing-look AGN, plus a number of ambiguous or unclassified sources. After a short historical introduction on the gamma-ray observations of Seyfert-type AGN, I explore the main statistical properties of 1477 jetted AGN from the rev4FGL with spectroscopic redshift, and also the cross-match with Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA) radio observations at 15~GHz from the Monitoring Of Jets in Active galactic nuclei with VLBA Experiments (MOJAVE) program. I then discuss the difference between gamma and non-gamma jetted AGN, and the implications on the classification.

Black holes are the simplest possible objects, characterised by only mass and spin. We see them via accretion, so there is one more fundamental parameter which is the mass accretion rate. Here I will review how the data from both stellar and supermassive black holes can be fit into a framework where there is a major spectral transition at $\dot{m}=L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ where the optically thick disc is replaced by a hot flow. This dramatic spectral change also affects the expected properties of thermal and radiatively powered winds, matching the overall properties of winds seen in new XRISM data from the stellar mass binaries, though there can also be additional UV and dust driven winds in supermassive black holes. The radio data in stellar and supermassive black holes are clear that the hot flow (not the disc) connects to the radio jet, and the radio-X-ray 'fundamental plane' can be qualitatively understood if the radio quiet AGN and stellar mass black holes have low to moderate spins, with the jet power set as a constant fraction of the accretion power. A small fraction of AGN (radio loud) instead have much higher (factor $100-1000\times$) radio-to-X-ray ratio at the same black hole mass and mass accretion rates. I speculate that these have higher jet power due to high black hole spin. I review the multiple issues still remaining in this picture, most of which are connected to the geometry and nature of the X-ray corona, and the conflicting constraints on this which come from reflection spectroscopy and polarimetry.

The nature of Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most outstanding mysteries of modern astrophysics. While the standard Cold DM (CDM) model successfully explains observations on most astrophysical scales, DM particles have not yet been detected, leaving room for a plethora of different models. In order to identify their observable signatures, we use the AIDA-TNG cosmological simulation suite to predict the distributions of gas and neutral hydrogen (HI) in the CDM, Self-Interacting DM (SIDM), velocity-dependent SIDM (vSIDM), and Warm DM (WDM) models.   We find that the DM models investigated have very limited impact on the median gas and HI profile of haloes. In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M_{\rm vir}\sim10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles.   We investigate the galaxy-Ly$α$ cross-correlation function (\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies. We find that at $z=0$ vSIDM can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $10^{12}\lesssim M_{\rm vir}\lesssim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, while SIDM1 can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $M_{\rm vir}\gtrsim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. We estimate that statistically-robust detection requires sampling $\sim160$ haloes with $\sim20$ sightlines each, a task that can be achieved with current and future facilities like WEAVE, 4MOST, PFS, ELT and WST.

The radius-luminosity ($R_{\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$) relation is fundamental to active galactic nucleus (AGN) studies, enabling supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass estimates and AGN-based cosmology applications. However, its high-luminosity end remains poorly calibrated due to insufficient reliable reverberation mapping (RM) data. We present a four-year RM campaign of the luminous quasar E1821+643 using the Lijiang 2.4-m telescope, supplemented by archival multi-wavelength data. E1821+643 is the most luminous AGN with an \hb\ RM measurement to date. The measured time lag of $83.2_{-18.7}^{+17.5}$ days is a factor of 5.6 shorter than predicted by the canonical $R_{\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$ relation. By compiling the full \hb\ RM sample, we find that such deviation defines a lower envelope ($0.2R_{\rm BLR}$) of measured lags across the entire luminosity range, while the upper envelope lies near $2R_{\rm BLR}$, implying that the scatter for individual AGNs can reach 1 dex. Spectral decomposition reveals two distinct \hb\ components: a core component with a lag of $267.0_{-17.6}^{+16.6}$ days closer to the $R_{\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$ relation, and a redshifted tail with a much shorter lag of $-49.0_{-34.5}^{+50.5}$ days. The short-lag component not only accounts for the significantly shortened overall lag, but also leads to an opposite interpretation of the intrinsic BLR kinematics. These effects can introduce systematic uncertainties in black hole mass estimates by factors of up to tens. Our findings demonstrate that shortened lags in high-accretion-rate AGNs arise from multi-component BLR structures, posing substantial challenges to single-epoch mass estimates and impacting SMBH demographics and cosmological applications.

The gravitational wave event GW190521 seems to be the only BH merger event possibly correlated with an electromagnetic counterpart, which appeared about 34 days after the GW event. This work aims to confirm that the electromagnetic bump towards the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1249+3449 can be explained within the framework of the gravitational microlensing phenomenon. In particular, considering the data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), what emerges from a detailed analysis of the observed light curve using three fitting models (Point Source Point Lens, Finite Source Point Lens, Uniform Source Binary Lens) is that the optical bump can be explained as a microlensing event caused by a lens with mass {$\sim\,$0.1 $M_{\odot}$}, lying in the host galaxy of the AGN in question.} %MDPI: Please confirm if the bold formatting is necessary; if not, please remove it.

We present a JWST/NIRSpec rest-frame optical spectroscopic census of ALMA 1-mm continuum sources in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) identified by the deep ALMA UDF and ASPECS programs. Our sample is composed of the ALMA flux-limited ($S_{1\,\mathrm{mm}}\gtrsim 0.1\,\mathrm{mJy}$) sources observed with medium-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy from JADES and SMILES, 16 faint submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at spectroscopic redshifts of $z\sim 1$-$4$. These SMGs show bright longer-wavelength optical lines (H$α$, [N II]$λ\lambda6548,6583$, and [S II]$λ\lambda6717,6731$) and faint shorter-wavelength optical lines (H$β$ and [O III]$λ\lambda4959,5007$) with a large nebular attenuation, $E(B-V)\sim0.3$-$1.8$. We test the SMGs using BPT diagnostics and Chandra X-ray fluxes, and find that most SMGs are classified as AGNs; the AGN fraction is $\sim80\%$ for the SMGs at $M_*&gt;10^{10.5} M_\odot$. We find only one SMG ($&lt;10\%$) with a broad Balmer line, indicating that the SMGs are predominantly obscured AGNs. With the optical lines, we estimate the metallicities of the SMGs to be moderately high, $\sim0.4$-$2 Z_\odot$, exceeding the model-predicted dust-growth critical metallicity ($\sim0.1$-$0.2Z_\odot$), which naturally explains the dusty nature of the SMGs. Interestingly, the SMGs fall in the mass-metallicity relation and the star-formation main sequence, showing no significant differences from other high-$z$ galaxies. Similarly, we find electron densities of $n_e\sim10^2$-$10^3\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ for the SMGs that are comparable with other high-$z$ galaxies. Together with the high SMG fraction ($\sim 100\%$) at the massive end ($M_*&gt;10^{10.5} M_\odot$), these results indicate that the SMGs are mostly not special, but typical massive star-forming galaxies at high redshift.

The energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered to have a profound impact on the cold gas properties of their host galaxies, potentially heating or removing the gas and further suppressing star formation. To understand the feedback from AGN radio activity, we investigate its impacts on the cold gas reservoirs in AGNs with different radio activity levels. We construct a quasar sample with a mean $z\sim1.5$ and a mean $L_{\rm bol}\sim10^{45.8}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$, all with Herschel detections to enable estimates of the total gas mass through the galactic dust continuum emission. The sample is then cross-matched with radio catalogs and divided into radio loud (RL) quasars, radio-detected radio quiet (RQ) quasars and radio-undetected quasars based on their radio loudness. Through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we find the radio-detected RQ quasars exhibit evidence of gas deficiency with host galaxies possessing $\sim 0.3$ dex lower dust and gas masses compared to the other two groups, despite being matched in $M_{\rm BH}$, $L_{\rm bol}$, $M_{*}$ and SFR. Furthermore, evidence from optical spectra shows that both the fraction and velocity of outflows are higher in the radio-detected RQ group, suggesting a connection between the ionized gas outflows and the moderate radio activity. These results suggest that the AGN feedback could be more efficient in AGNs with weak/moderate radio emission than in those without radio detection or those with strong radio emission. Further high-resolution observations are needed to understand the interaction between the interstellar medium and the weak/moderate AGN radio activity.

We report the detection of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons from three massive ($\text{M}_{*}&gt;10^{10}\:\text{M}_{\odot}$) spiral galaxies at a redshift of nearly 1 in the AstroSat UV Deep Field South. Notably, all three systems are viewed at low inclination (i.e., nearly face-on), prompting an investigation into the role of galaxy orientation in the detectability of LyC emission from disk systems. Two of the three galaxies, however, host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), adding complexity to the interpretation of the LyC signal. We present a detailed analysis of the likely star-forming case, and report tentative evidence that a face-on viewing angle may enhance the likelihood of LyC detection in disk galaxies. This represents the first detection of LyC emission from well-characterized spiral galaxies at high redshift, offering a new window into LyC escape mechanisms in such systems. Our findings highlight the need to consider geometric factors and anisotropic escape pathways facilitated by feedback processes alongside more traditional density-bounded scenarios that imply isotropic escape.

Despite its proximity, the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the spiral galaxy M81 (NGC~3031) has remained uncertain, with previous dynamical measurements being unreliable. We present the first robust stellar-dynamical measurement of its mass using high-resolution, two-dimensional kinematics from JWST/NIRSpec observations of the central $3''\times3''$. By tracing stellar motions in the near-infrared, our data penetrate the obscuring nuclear dust and allow for the separation of stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We modeled the kinematics using JAM within a Bayesian framework, exploring a comprehensive suite of models that systematically account for uncertainties in the point-spread function, orbital anisotropy, and stellar mass-to-light ratio. This ensemble modeling approach demonstrates that a central dark mass unambiguously drives the central rise in velocity dispersion. The models yield a robust SMBH mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (4.78^{+0.07}_{-0.10})\times10^7$ M$_\odot$. This result resolves a long-standing uncertainty in the mass of M81's black hole and provides a crucial, reliable anchor point for SMBH-galaxy scaling relations.  

The rest ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distributions of heavily reddened quasars are "V-shaped" and hot-dust poor

We present a rest-ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 63 heavily reddened quasars (HRQs) at redshifts z=0.7-2.7 and with dust extinctions E(B-V)=0.4-1.8. Our analysis demonstrates that SEDs with red optical and blue UV continua are very common in HRQs, with more than 82 per cent of the sample showing a UV-excess relative to the reddened quasar continuum. We model the SEDs by combining a reddened quasar and an unobscured scattered light component, though contributions from a star-forming host galaxy cannot be ruled out. The average scattering fraction is small (0.3 per cent). Higher scattering fractions are ruled out by the (i-K)=2.5 colour-cut used to select HRQs which pre-dates the discovery of the JWST "Little Red Dot" (LRD) population. Hence, LRDs generally have bluer UV continua. Nevertheless, four HRQs satisfy the LRD UV/optical continuum slope selections and are therefore massive, cosmic noon analogues of LRDs. Analysis of the near-infrared SEDs of HRQs reveals a deficit of hot dust relative to blue quasars, similar to what is observed in LRDs. This suggests HRQs trace a phase where strong AGN feedback processes eject dust from the inner torus. The UV scattering fraction of HRQs is weakly correlated with the amount of hot dust emission and anti-correlated with the line-of-sight extinction, E(B-V). This is consistent with the hot dust acting as the scattering medium, and the line-of-sight extinction being dominated by dust on interstellar medium scales in the host galaxy.
