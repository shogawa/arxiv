  Growing evidence in support of a connection between Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity and the Ram-Pressure Stripping (RPS) phenomenon has been found both observationally and theoretically in the past decades. In this work, we further explore the impact of RPS on the AGN activity by estimating the gas-phase metallicity of nuclear regions and the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies at $z \leq$ 0.07 and with stellar masses $\log {\rm M}_* / {\rm M}_\odot \geq 9.0 $, either experiencing RPS or not. To measure oxygen abundances, we exploit Integral Field Spectroscopy data from the GASP and MaNGA surveys, photoionization models generated with the code CLOUDY and the code Nebulabayes to compare models and observations. In particular, we build CLOUDY models to reproduce line ratios induced by photoionization from stars, AGN, or a contribution of both. We find that the distributions of metallicity and [O III]$\lambda$5007 luminosity of galaxies undergoing RPS are similar to the ones of undisturbed galaxies. Independently of the RPS, we do not find a correlation between stellar mass and AGN metallicity in the mass range $\log {\rm M}_* / {\rm M}_\odot \geq 10.4$, while for the star-forming galaxies we observe the well-known mass-metallicity relation (MZR) between $ 9.0 \leq \log \ {\rm M}_* /{\rm M}_\odot \leq 10.8$ with a scatter mainly driven by the star-formation rate (SFR) and a plateau around $\log {\rm M}_* / {\rm M}_\odot \sim 10.5$. The gas-phase metallicity in the nuclei of AGN hosts is enhanced with respect to those of SF galaxies by a factor of $\sim$ 0.05 dex regardless of the RPS.

  We present an investigation into the spectroscopic properties of non-equilibrium photoionization processes operating in a time-evolving mode. Through a quantitative comparison between equilibrium and time-evolving models, we find that the time-evolving model exhibits a broader distribution of charge states compared to the equilibrium model, accompanied by a slight shift in the peak ionization state depending on the source variability and gas density. The time-evolving code, tpho in SPEX, has been successfully employed to analyze the spectral properties of warm absorbers in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3783. The incorporation of variability in the tpho model improves the fits of the time-integrated spectra, providing more accurate descriptions to the average charge states of several elements, in particular for Fe which is peaked around Fe XIX. The inferred densities and distances of the relevant X-ray absorber components are estimated to be approximately a few 1E11 per cubic meter and less than 1 pc, respectively. Furthermore, the updated fit suggests a potential scenario in which the observed absorbers are being expelled from the central AGN at the escape velocities. This implies that these absorbers might not play a significant role in the AGN feedback mechanism.

  Gas rich galaxies are typically star-forming. We make use of HI-MaNGA, a program of HI follow-up for the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys to construct a sample of unusual neutral hydrogen (HI, 21cm) rich galaxies which have low Star Formation Rates (SFRs); using infra-red color from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) as a proxy for specific SFR. Out of a set of 1575 MaNGA galaxies with HI-MaNGA detections, we find 83 (5%) meet our selection criteria to be HI rich with low SFR. We construct two stellar mass-matched control samples: HI rich galaxies with typical SFR (High SF Control) and HI poor galaxies with low SFR (Low HI Control). We investigate the properties of each of these samples, comparing physical parameters such as ionization state maps, stellar and ionized gas velocity and dispersion, environment measures, metallicity, and morphology to search for the reasons why these unusual HI rich galaxies are not forming stars. We find evidence for recent external accretion of gas in some galaxies (via high counter-rotating fractions), along with some evidence for AGN feedback (from a high cLIER and/or red geyser fraction), and bar quenching (via an enhanced strong bar fraction). Some galaxies in the sample are consistent with simply having their HI in a high angular momentum, large radius, low density disc. We conclude that no single physical process can explain all HI rich, low SFR galaxies.

  The role of energetic outflows from galactic nuclei in shaping galaxy formation and evolution is still shrouded in uncertainty. In this study, we shed light on this complex phenomenon by presenting evidence for a large-scale bipolar radio/X-ray-emitting bubble-like structure emanating from the central region of the nearby disk galaxy M106 (NGC 4258). Our findings, based on Low-Frequency Array survey data and Chandra observations, provide a glimpse into the underlying physical processes driving this enigmatic structure. Similar to the eROSITA/Fermi bubbles in our own Galaxy, the M106 bubbles enclose diffuse hot plasma and are partially bounded by prominent radio/X-ray-emitting edges. We constrain the magnetic field and cosmic-ray properties of the structure. The analysis of the X-ray data gives an estimate of the thermal energy of the bubbles as ~8 x 10^56 erg. This energy can be supplied by the jets and perhaps by the wind from the accretion flow of the galaxy's low-luminosity AGN, which most likely has been much more powerful in the recent past, with an average mechanical energy release rate of ~4 x 10^42 erg/s over the last ~ 8 x 10^6 yr -- the estimated age of the structure. We also show evidence for diffuse X-ray emission on larger scales, indicating the presence of a hot galactic corona. Our results provide a clear manifestation of galactic nuclear feedback regulating the gas content and energetics of the circumgalactic medium of disk galaxies similar to our own.

  Polarization observations through the next-generation large telescopes will be invaluable for exploring the magnetic fields and composition of jets in AGN, multi-messenger transients follow-up, and understanding interstellar dust and magnetic fields. The 25m Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) is one of the next-generation large telescopes and is expected to have its first light in 2029. The telescope consists of a primary mirror and an adaptive secondary mirror comprising seven circular segments. The telescope supports instruments at both Nasmyth as well as Gregorian focus. However, none of the first or second-generation instruments on GMT has the polarimetric capability. This paper presents a detailed polarimetric modeling of the GMT for both Gregorian and folded ports for astronomical B-K filter bands and a field of view of 5 arc minutes. At 500nm, The instrumental polarization is 0.1% and 3% for the Gregorian and folded port, respectively. The linear to circular crosstalk is 0.1% and 30% for the Gregorian and folded ports, respectively. The Gregorian focus gives the GMT a significant competitive advantage over TMT and ELT for sensitive polarimetry, as these telescopes support instruments only on the Nasmyth platform. We also discuss a list of polarimetric science cases and assess science case requirements vs. the modeling results. Finally, we discuss the possible routes for polarimetry with GMT and show the preliminary optical design of the GMT polarimeter.

  We present the results of a size and structural analysis of 1395 galaxies at $0.5 \leq z \lesssim 8$ with stellar masses $\log \left(M_* / M_{\odot}\right)$ $&gt;$ 9.5 within the JWST Public CEERS field that overlaps with the HST CANDELS EGS observations. We use GALFIT to fit single S\'ersic models to the rest-frame optical profile of our galaxies, which is a mass-selected sample complete to our redshift and mass limit. Our primary result is that at fixed rest-frame wavelength and stellar mass, galaxies get progressively smaller, evolving as $\sim (1+z)^{-0.71\pm0.19}$ up to $z \sim 8$. We discover that the vast majority of massive galaxies at high redshifts have low S\'ersic indices, thus do not contain steep, concentrated light profiles. Additionally, we explore the evolution of the size-stellar mass relationship, finding a correlation such that more massive systems are larger up to $z \sim 3$. This relationship breaks down at $z &gt; 3$, where we find that galaxies are of similar sizes, regardless of their star formation rates and S\'ersic index, varying little with mass. We show that galaxies are more compact at redder wavelengths, independent of sSFR or stellar mass up to $z \sim 3$. We demonstrate the size evolution of galaxies continues up to $z \sim 8$, showing that the process or causes for this evolution is active at early times. We discuss these results in terms of ideas behind galaxy formation and evolution at early epochs, such as their importance in tracing processes driving size evolution, including minor mergers and AGN activity.
