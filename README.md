  Radio galaxies are a key population to understand the importance of relativistic jets in AGN feedback. We present the results of a systematic, broadband X-ray spectral analysis of hard X-ray selected radio galaxies to investigate their nuclear structures. In this study, we focus on the seven most radio-loud, X-ray obscured narrow line radio galaxies in the \textit{Swift}/BAT 70 month AGN catalog. The spectra from 0.5 keV up to 66 keV obtained with \textit{Suzaku} and \textit{NuSTAR} of six objects are newly analyzed here by utilizing the X-ray clumpy torus model (XCLUMPY), whereas we refer to Ogawa et al. (2021) for the results of Centaurus A. We find that these radio galaxies have similar torus covering fractions compared with radio quiet AGNs at the same Eddington ratios ($-3 &lt; \log \lambda_{\rm Edd} &lt; -1$). This result implies that (1) the torus structure is not an important factor that determines the presence of jets and (2) AGN jets have physically little effect on the torus.

  Recent observations with the \textit{James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) have further refined the spectroscopic redshift of GN-z11, one of the most distant galaxies identified with the \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope (HST) at $z=10.603$. The presence of extremely dense gas ($&gt;10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), the detection of high-ionisation lines and of CII*1335 emission, as well as the presence of an ionisation cone, indicate that GN-z11 also hosts an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Further photometric and spectroscopic follow-up demonstrates that it lies in a large-scale, overdense structure with possible signatures of Population III (PopIII) stars in its halo. Surprisingly, Ly$\alpha$ has also been detected despite the expected largely neutral inter-galactic medium at such a redshift. We exploit recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations to demonstrate that the Ly$\alpha$ emission in GN-z11 is part of an extended halo with a minimum size of 0.8--3.2 kpc, depending on the definition used to derive the halo size. The surface brightness of the Ly$\alpha$ halo around GN-z11 appears consistent with Ly$\alpha$ halos observed around $z\sim6$ quasars. At the wavelength of Ly$\alpha$ at $z\sim$10.6, we identify three other emission line candidates within the IFU Field-of-View with no UV rest-frame counterpart visible in deep images from the JWST/NIRCam. If confirmed, this could be the first evidence that the local region of GN-z11 represents a candidate protocluster core, forming just 400 Myr after the Big Bang. We give a first estimate of the dark matter halo mass of this structure ($M_h$=2.96$^{+0.44}_{-0.39} \times$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), consistent with a Coma-like cluster progenitor.

  Optical rest-frame spectroscopic diagnostics are usually employed to distinguish between star formation and AGN-powered emission. However, this method is biased against dusty sources, hampering a complete census of the AGN population across cosmic epochs. To mitigate this effect, it is crucial to observe at longer wavelengths in the rest-frame near-infrared (near-IR), which is less affected by dust attenuation and can thus provide a better description of the intrinsic properties of galaxies. AGN diagnostics in this regime have not been fully exploited so far, due to the scarcity of near-IR observations of both AGNs and star-forming galaxies, especially at redshifts higher than 0.5. Using Cloudy photoionization models, we identify new AGN - star formation diagnostics based on the ratio of bright near-infrared emission lines, namely [SIII] 9530 Angstrom, [CI] 9850 Angstrom, [PII] 1.188 $\mu m$, [FeII] $1.257 \mu m$, and [FeII] $1.64 \mu m$ to Paschen lines (either Pa$\gamma$ or Pa$\beta$), providing simple, analytical classification criteria. We apply these diagnostics to a sample of 64 star-forming galaxies and AGNs at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1, and 65 sources at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 recently observed with JWST-NIRSpec in CEERS. We find that the classification inferred from the near-infrared is broadly consistent with the optical one based on the BPT and the [SII]/H$\alpha$ ratio. However, in the near-infrared, we find $\sim 60 \%$ more AGNs than in the optical (13 instead of 8), with 5 sources classified as 'hidden' AGNs, showing a larger AGN contribution at longer wavelengths, possibly due to the presence of optically thick dust. The diagnostics we present provide a promising tool to find and characterize AGNs from z=0 to z=3 with low and medium-resolution near-IR spectrographs in future surveys.

  In this article, I review past, current, and future advances on the study of radio-loud AGN (RLAGN; radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies) lifecycles exclusively in the remnant and restarting phases. I focus on their dynamics and energetics as inferred from radio observations while discussing their radiative lifetimes, population statistics, and trends in their physical characteristics. I briefly summarize multi-wavelength observations, particularly X-rays, that have enabled studies of the large-scale environments of RLAGN in order to understand their role in feedback. Furthermore, I discuss analytic and numerical simulations that predict key properties of remnant and restarting sources as found in wide-area surveys, and discuss the prospects of future surveys that may shed further light on these elusive subpopulations of RLAGN.
