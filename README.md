  Aims:Calibrating the point spread function (PSF) is a fundamental part of weak gravitational lensing analyses. Even with corrected galaxy images, imperfect calibrations can introduce biases. We propose an analytical framework for quantifying PSF-induced systematics as diagnostics for cross-correlation measurements of weak lensing with density tracers, e.g., galaxy-galaxy lensing. We show how those systematics propagate to physical parameters of the density tracers. Those diagnostics only require a shape catalogue of PSF stars and foreground galaxy positions. Methods:We consider the PSF-induced multiplicative bias, and introduce three second-order statistics as additive biases. We compute both biases for the weak-lensing derived halo mass of spectroscopic foreground galaxy samples, in particular, their effect on the tangential shear and fitted halo mass as a function of stellar mass. In addition, we assess their impact on the recently published black-hole - halo-mass relation for type I Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Results:Using weak-lensing catalogues from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) and Dark Energy Survey (DES), we find the multiplicative biases in the tangential shear to be less than $0.5\%$. No correlations between additive bias and galaxy properties of the foreground sample are detected. The combined PSF systematics affect low-mass galaxies and small angular scales; halo mass estimates can be biased by up to 18$\%$ for a sample of central galaxies in the stellar mass range 9.0 $\leq$ log $M_*/\rm M_{\odot}$ &lt; 9.5. Conclusions:The PSF-induced multiplicative bias is a subdominant contribution to current studies of weak-lensing - density cross-correlations, but might become significant for upcoming Stage-VI surveys. For samples with a low tangential shear, additive PSF systematics can induce a significant bias on derived properties such as halo mass.

  Based on the integral field unit (IFU) data from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, we develop a new method to select galaxies with biconical ionized structures, building a sample of 142 edge-on biconical ionized galaxies. We classify these 142 galaxies into 81 star-forming galaxies, 31 composite galaxies, and 30 AGNs (consisting of 23 Seyferts and 7 LI(N)ERs) according to the {\nii}-BPT diagram. The star-forming bicones have bar-like structures while AGN bicones display hourglass structures, and composite bicones exhibit transitional morphologies between them due to both black hole and star-formation activities. Star-forming bicones have intense star-formation activities in their central regions, and the primary driver of biconical structures is the central star formation rate surface density. The lack of difference in the strength of central black hole activities (traced by dust attenuation corrected {\oiii}$\lambda$5007 luminosity and Eddington ratio) between Seyfert bicones and their control samples can be naturally explained as that the accretion disk and the galactic disk are not necessarily coplanar. Additionally, the biconical galaxies with central LI(N)ER-like line ratios are edge-on disk galaxies that show strong central dust attenuation. The radial gradients of {\ha} surface brightness follow the $r^{-2.35}$ relation, roughly consistent with $r^{-2}$ profile, which is expected in the case of photoionization by a central point-like source. These observations indicate obscured AGNs or AGN echoes as the primary drivers of biconical structures in LI(N)ERs.

  Stars and compact objects embedded in accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dubbed as ``accretion-modified star" (AMS), often experience hyper-Eddington accretion in the dense gas environment, resulting in powerful outflows as the Bondi explosion and formation of cavities. The varying gas properties across different regions of the AGN disk can give rise to diverse and intriguing phenomena. In this paper, we conduct a study on the characteristics of AMSs situated in the outer, middle, and inner regions of the AGN disk, where growth of the AMSs during the shift inwards is considered. We calculate their multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and thermal light curves. Our results reveal that the thermal luminosity of Bondi explosion occurring in the middle region leads to UV flares with a luminosity of $\sim 10^{44}\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}$. The synchrotron radiation of Bondi explosion in the middle and inner regions peaks at the X-ray band with luminosities of $\sim 10^{43}$ and $\sim 10^{42}\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}$, respectively. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity of inverse Compton radiation spans from $10^{42}$ to $10^{43}\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}$ peaked at $\sim 10\,$MeV (outer region) and $\sim$ GeV (middle and inner regions) bands. The observable flares of AMS in the middle region exhibits a slow rise and rapid Gaussian decay with a duration of months, while in the inner region, it exhibits a fast rise and slow Gaussian decay with a duration of several hours. These various SED and light curve features provides valuable insights into the various astronomical transient timescales associated with AGNs.

  Variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has long been servicing as an essential avenue of exploring the accretion physics of black hole (BH). There are two commonly used methods for analyzing AGN variability. First, the AGN variability, characterized by the structure function (SF) of a single band, can be well described by a damped random walk (DRW) process on timescales longer than ~weeks, shorter than which departures have been reported. Second, the color variation (CV) between two bands behaves timescale-dependent, raising challenges to the widely accepted reprocessing scenario. However, both the departure from the DRW process and the timescale-dependent CV are hitherto limited to AGNs, mainly quasars, at the supermassive scale. Here, utilizing the high-cadence multi-wavelength monitoring on NGC 4395 harboring an intermediate-mass BH, we unveil at the intermediate-mass scale for the first time, prominent departures from the DRW process at timescales shorter than ~hours in all three nights and bands, and plausible timescale-dependent CVs in the two longest nights of observation. Furthermore, comparing SFs of NGC 4395 to four AGNs at the supermassive scale, we suggest a new scaling relation between the timescale (\uptau; across nearly three orders of magnitude) and the BH mass (M_BH): \uptau \propto M^\gamma_BH where the exponent \gamma is likely ~ 0.6 - 0.8. This exponent differs from most previous measurements, but confirms a few and is consistent with a recent theoretical prediction, suggesting a similar accretion process in AGNs across different mass scales.

  We present ALMA [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and underlying far-infrared continuum emission observations ($0''.57 \times 0''.46$ resolution) toward a quasar-quasar pair system recently discovered at $z = 6.05$ (Matsuoka et al. 2024). The quasar nuclei (C1 and C2) are very faint ($M_{\rm 1450} \gtrsim -23$ mag), but we detect very bright [CII] emission bridging the 12 kpc between the two objects and extending beyond them (total luminosity $L_{\rm [CII]} \simeq 6 \times 10^9~L_\odot$). The total star formation rate of the system is $\sim 100$ to 550 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, with a [CII]-based total gas mass of $\sim 10^{11}~M_\odot$. The dynamical masses of the two galaxies are large ($\sim 9 \times 10^{10}~M_\odot$ for C1 and $\sim 5 \times 10^{10}~M_\odot$ for C2). There is a smooth velocity gradient in [CII], indicating that these quasars are a tidally interacting system. We identified a dynamically distinct, fast [CII] component around C1. Detailed inspection of the line spectrum reveals the presence of a broad wing component, which we interpret as the indication of fast outflows with a velocity of $\sim 600$ km s$^{-1}$. The expected mass loading factor of the outflows, after accounting for multiphase gas, would be $\gtrsim 3-8$, as expected for an AGN-driven outflow. Hydrodynamic simulations in the literature predicted that this pair will evolve to a luminous ($M_{\rm 1450} \lesssim -26$ mag), starbursting ($\gtrsim 1000~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) quasar after coalescence, one of the most extreme populations in the early universe.

  Studying the behavior along the galaxy main sequence is key in furthering our understanding of the possible connection between AGN activity and star formation. We select a sample of 1215 AGN from the catalog of SDSS galaxy properties from the Portsmouth group by detection of the high-ionization [Ne V] 3426 \r{A} emission line. Our sample extends from 10$^{40}$ to 10$^{42.5}$ erg/s in [Ne V] luminosity in a redshift range z = 0.17 to 0.57. We compare the specific star formation rates (sSFRs, SFR scaled by galaxy mass) obtained from the corrected [O II] and H{\alpha} luminosities, and the SED-determined values from Portsmouth. We find that the emission-line-based sSFR values are unreliable for the [Ne V] sample due to the AGN contribution, and proceed with the SED sSFRs for our study of the main sequence. We find evidence for a decrease in sSFR along the main sequence in the [Ne V] sample which is consistent with results from the hard X-ray BAT AGN sample, which extends to lower redshifts than our [Ne V] sample. Although we do not find evidence that the concurrent AGN activity is suppressing star formation, our results are consistent with a lower gas fraction in the host galaxies of the AGN as compared to that of the star forming galaxies. If the evacuation of gas, and therefore suppression of star formation is due to AGN activity, it must have occurred in a previous epoch.

  As an inaugural investigation under the X-ray Winds In Nearby-to-distant Galaxies (X-WING) program, we assembled a dataset comprising 132 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) spanning redshifts $z \sim 0$-$4$ characterized by blueshifted absorption lines indicative of X-ray winds. Through an exhaustive review of previous research, we compiled the outflow parameters for 573 X-ray winds, encompassing key attributes such as outflow velocities ($V_{\rm out}$), ionization parameters ($\xi$), and hydrogen column densities. By leveraging the parameters $V_{\rm out}$ and $\xi$, we systematically categorized the winds into three distinct groups: ultrafast outflows (UFOs), low-ionization parameter (low-IP) UFOs, and warm absorbers. Strikingly, a discernible absence of linear correlations in the outflow parameters, coupled with distributions approaching instrumental detection limits, was observed. Another notable finding was the identification of a velocity gap around $V_{\rm out} \sim 10,000~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$. This gap was particularly evident in the winds detected via absorption lines within the $\lesssim$2 keV band, indicating disparate origins for low-IP UFOs and warm absorbers. In cases involving Fe XXV/Fe XXVI lines, where the gap might be attributed to potential confusion between emission/absorption lines and the Fe K-edge, the possibility of UFOs and galactic-scale warm absorbers being disconnected is considered. An examination of the outflow and dust sublimation radii revealed a distinction: UFOs appear to consist of dust-free material, whereas warm absorbers likely comprise dusty gas. From 2024, the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) is poised to alleviate observational biases, providing insights into the authenticity of the identified gap, a pivotal question in comprehending AGN feedback from UFOs.
