  Variability is a fundamental signature for active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, and serve as an unbiased indicator for rapid instability happened near the center supermassive black hole (BH). Previous studies showed that AGN variability does not have strong redshift evolution, and scales with their bolometric luminosity and BH mass, making it a powerful probe to identify low-mass, low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift. JWST has discovered a new population of high-redshift galaxies likely hosting moderate accreting BHs ($10^6\,M_\odot$) -- the little red dots (LRDs, $z=4-10$). In this paper, we study the variability of a sample of 21 LRDs with V-shaped SEDs in three JWST deep fields that also have reliable HST observations in closely paired filters at 1-2 um (rest-frame UV), with the time difference between 6 and 11 years. This LRD sample covers a redshift range of $3&lt;z&lt;8$ with median -21.3$&lt;M_\mathrm{UV}&lt;$-18.4. Based on both photometry and imaging difference analyses, we find a mean magnitude difference of 0.12$\pm$0.24 mag, with none of the LRDs showing photometric variability at 3$\sigma$ significance. Extrapolation of SDSS quasar variability predicts a magnitude change of order 0.3 mag for our LRD sample. This suggests an upper limit of about 30\% AGN contribution to the total observed UV light in our sample of LRDs.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently discovered a new population of objects at high redshift referred to as `Little Red Dots' (LRDs). Their nature currently remains elusive, despite their surprisingly high inferred number densities. This emerging population of red point-like sources is reshaping our view of the early Universe and may shed light on the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present a spectroscopically confirmed LRD CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z_{\rm spec}=8.6319\pm 0.0005$ hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), using JWST data. This source shows the typical spectral shape of an LRD (blue UV and red optical continuum, unresolved in JWST imaging), along with broad H$\beta$ line emission, detection of high-ionization emission lines (CIV, NIV]) and very high electron temperature indicative of the presence of AGN. This is also combined with a very low metallicity ($Z&lt;0.1 Z_\odot$). The presence of all these diverse features in one source makes CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 unique. We show that the inferred black hole mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 ($M_{\rm BH}=1.0^{+0.6}_{-0.4}\times 10^{8}\rm ~M_\odot$) strongly challenges current standard theoretical models and simulations of black hole formation, and forces us to adopt `ad hoc' prescriptions. Indeed if massive seeds, or light seeds with super-Eddington accretion, are considered, the observed BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at $z=8.6$ can be reproduced. Moreover, the black hole is over-massive compared to its host, relative to the local $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relations, pointing towards an earlier and faster evolution of the black hole compared to its host galaxy.

  The circumgalactic medium (CGM) around massive galaxies plays a crucial role in regulating star formation and feedback. Using the CAMELS simulation suite, we develop emulators for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the X-ray luminosity--stellar mass scaling relation to investigate how stellar and AGN feedback shape the X-ray properties of the hot CGM. Our analysis shows that at CGM scales ($10^{12} \lesssim M_{\rm halo}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{13}$, $10\lesssim r/{\rm kpc} \lesssim 400$), stellar feedback more significantly impacts the X-ray properties than AGN feedback within the parameters studied. Comparing the emulators to recent eROSITA All-Sky Survey observations, it was found that stronger feedback than currently implemented in the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid simulations is required to match observed CGM properties. However, adopting these enhanced feedback parameters causes deviations in the stellar-mass-halo-mass relations from observational constraints below the group mass scale. This tension suggests possible unaccounted systematics in X-ray CGM observations or inadequacies in the feedback models of cosmological simulations.

  We present a detailed exploration of the most optically-luminous Little Red Dot ($L_{H\alpha}=10^{44}$erg/s, $L_V=10^{45}$erg/s, F444W=22AB) found to date. Located in the Abell 2744 field, source A744-45924 was observed by NIRSpec/PRISM with ultradeep spectroscopy reaching SNR$\sim$100pix$^{-1}$, high-resolution 3-4 micron NIRCam/Grism spectroscopy, and NIRCam Medium Band imaging. The NIRCam spectra reveal high rest-frame EW $W_{H\alpha,0,broad}&gt;800$\r{A}, broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM$\sim$4500 km/s), on top of narrow, complex absorption. NIRSpec data show exceptionally strong rest-frame UV to NIR Fe II emission ($W_{FeII-UV,0}\sim$340\r{A}), N IV]$\lambda\lambda$1483,1486 and N III]$\lambda$1750, and broad NIR O I $\lambda$8446 emission. The spectra unambiguously demonstrate a broad-line region associated with an inferred $M_{BH}\sim10^9M_\odot$ supermassive black hole embedded in dense gas, which might explain a non-detection in ultradeep Chandra X-ray data (&gt;$10\times$ underluminous relative to broad $L_{H\alpha}$). Strong UV Nitrogen lines suggest supersolar N/O ratios due to rapid star formation or intense radiation near the AGN. The continuum shows a clear Balmer break at rest-frame 3650\r{A}, which cannot be accounted for by an AGN power-law alone. A stellar population model produces an excellent fit with a reddened Balmer break and implying a massive ($M_*\sim8\times10^{10}M_\odot$), old $\sim$500 Myr, compact stellar core, among the densest stellar systems known ($\rho\sim3\times10^6M_\odot$/pc$^2$ for $R_{e,opt}=70\pm10$ pc), and AGN emission with extreme intrinsic EW $W_{H\alpha,0}\gg$1000\r{A}. However, although high $M_*$ and $M_{BH}$ are supported by evidence of an overdensity containing 40 galaxies at $z=4.41-4.51$, deep high-resolution spectroscopy is required to confirm stellar absorption and rule out that dense gas around the AGN causes the Balmer break instead.   

On the signature of black holes on the quenched stellar mass function

  As star-forming galaxies approach or exceed a stellar mass around $10^{11} M_\odot$, they are increasingly likely to be quenched in a process generically called mass quenching. Central galaxies, which are quenched via mass rather than environmental quenching, therefore accumulate in a peak around this characteristic mass. While a number of processes may influence the shape of the quenched central stellar mass function (QCSMF), we find that its low-mass slope is strongly affected by the scatter in the mass of black holes at a given stellar mass, with higher scatters in the black hole population yielding shallower slopes. Higher scatters in the black hole mass spread out the stellar mass range over which quenching occurs, leading to shallower slopes. This trend holds across a variety of semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. A comparison with observations provides indirect evidence for a large scatter in black hole mass $\sigma(\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{BH})|M_*) \gtrsim 0.5$ dex, and a joint constraint on AGN feedback physics and the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes.

  The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at $z\sim6.25$ likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim3\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.4$. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds ($\nu\sim10^4~{\rm km/s}$). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion $\sim$5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio ($\gtrsim10$), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.
