Reverberation mapping (RM) is a powerful tool to determine the extent, structure, and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN). So far, RM of the BLR has only been performed for recombination lines responding to the varying ionizing continuum. We tested whether OI 8446, attributed to Bowen fluorescence driven by Ly$β$ pumping, varied on short (day- to week-long) timescales during a 2016 HST/STIS campaign of NGC 4593, and examined how it relates to other emission lines and the ionizing UV continuum. We quantified the variability of OI 8446 by calculating its rms amplitude. We then extracted integrated light curves of OI 8446 and other UV and optical emission lines, and compared them with each other and with the UV continuum light curve using correlation analyses. In addition, we used archival near-infrared spectra to assess the dominant excitation mechanism of OI 8446. We detect, for the first time, variability in OI 8446 on day timescales. The fractional rms amplitude is $\sim 4$% over the 4-week campaign. The OI 8446 light curve reverberates with a delay of $\sim 2.5$ days relative to Ly$α$, used as a proxy for Ly$β$, detected at a false-alarm probability of 0.6% (significance of $\sim 2.8σ$) under our adopted null hypothesis. It closely tracks H$α$ with only a minor additional delay of $\sim0.3$ days, placing its emission region at essentially the same distance as the Balmer-line weighted BLR. Line ratios indicate that Ly$β$ pumping is the dominant excitation mechanism for O I 8446. Our results establish OI 8446 as the first Bowen-fluorescence line reverberation-mapped, responding directly to variations in Ly$β$ flux. We propose that in future campaigns targeting AGN with larger BLRs, O I could enable dual-driver RM using both the continuum and the pumping line as drivers.

We study void galaxies in the TNG300 simulation between redshifts $z=3$ and $z=0$. Cosmic void catalogs were constructed using a watershed-based void-finding algorithm, and we define four populations of field galaxies for our investigation: [1] galaxies that are members of a watershed void, [2] galaxies that are located within a radius $r \leq 0.8 R_{\rm eff}$ of the center of a void, [3] galaxies interior to spheres centered on void centers that have underdensity contrasts $&lt;-0.8$, and [4] non-void galaxies. We show that population statistics on void galaxy properties can be recovered from watershed-based void catalogs. Differences between galaxy populations are most pronounced interior to the shell-crossing surface (i.e., population [3]) where densities are intermediate to high. Compared to non-void galaxies at all redshifts, the density controlled galaxies are bluer, smaller, more actively star forming, more massive, and less metal enriched. At redshifts $\geq 1$, these differences are less apparent, likely caused by resolution and selection effects incurred by attempting to define a density-controlled sample from a watershed-based void finding algorithm. Further, we investigate the fraction of galaxies with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and find that our density controlled population has AGN fractions that are significantly higher than those of non-void galaxy population ($79.8 \pm 0.4$\% higher at $z=0.0$ and $61.5\pm 0.7$\% higher at larger redshifts).

We investigate the origin of inter-band continuum time delays in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to study the structure and properties of their accretion disks. We aim to measure the inter-band continuum time delays through photometric monitoring of Seyfert galaxy Fairall 9 to construct the lag-spectrum. Additionally, we explain the observed features in the Fairall 9 lag-spectrum and discuss the potential drivers behind them, based on our newly collected data from the Obserwatorium Cerro Murphy (OCM) telescope. We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall 9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall 9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $τ_λ \propto λ^β$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays.
