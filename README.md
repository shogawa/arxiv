  We present a detailed multi-wavelength study of star formation in the dwarfgalaxy NGC 4395 which hosts an active galactic nucleus (AGN). From ourobservations with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope, we have compiled acatalogue of 284 star forming (SF) regions, out of which we could detect 120 SFregions in H$\alpha$ observations. Across the entire galaxy, we found theextinction corrected star formation rate (SFR) in the far ultra-violet (FUV) torange from 2.0 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ with a median of 3.0 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$and age to lie in the range of $\sim$ 1 to 98 Myr with a median of 14 Myr. InH$\alpha$ we found the SFR to range from 7.2 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to 2.7 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ with a medianof 1.7 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and age to lie between 3 to 6 Myrwith a median of 5 Myr. The stellar ages derived from H$\alpha$ show a gradualdecline with galactocentric distance. We found three SF regions close to thecenter of NGC~4395 with high SFR both from H$\alpha$ and UV which could beattributed to feedback effects from the AGN. We also found six other SF regionsin one of the spiral arms having higher SFR. These are very close to supernovaeremnants which could have enhanced the SFR locally. We obtained a specific SFR(SFR per unit mass) for the whole galaxy 4.64 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$.

  We report ALMA high-resolution observations of water emission lines$p-{\rm{H_2O}} (2_{02}-1_{11}$), $o-{\rm{H_2O}} (3_{21}-3_{12})$,$p-{\rm{H_2O}} (4_{22}-4_{13})$, in the strongly lensed galaxyHATLASJ113526.2-01460 at redshift z $\sim$ 3.1. From the lensing-reconstructedmaps of water emission and line profiles, we infer the general physicalproperties of the ISM in the molecular clouds where the lines arise. We findthat the water vapor lines $o-{\rm{H_2O}} (3_{21}-3_{12})$, $p-{\rm{H_2O}}(4_{22}-4_{13})$ are mainly excited by FIR pumping from dust radiation in awarm and dense environment, with dust temperatures ranging from 70 K to $\sim100$ K, as suggested by the line ratios. The $p-{\rm{H_2O}} (2_{02}-1_{11})$line instead, is excited by a complex interplay between FIR pumping andcollisional excitation in the dense core of the star-forming region. Thisscenario is also supported by the detection of the medium-level excitation ofCO resulting in the line emission CO (J=8-7). Thanks to the unprecedented highresolution offered by the combination of ALMA capabilities and gravitationallensing, we discern the different phases of the ISM and locate the hotmolecular clouds into a physical scale of $\sim$ 500 pc. We discuss thepossibility of J1135 hosting an AGN in its accretion phase. Finally, wedetermine the relation between the water emission lines and the total IRluminosity of J1135, as well as the SFR as a function of water emissionintensities, comparing the outcomes to local and high-$z$ galactic samples fromthe literature.

  We present a variability, color and morphology based classifier, designed toidentify transients, persistently variable, and non-variable sources, from theZwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 11 (DR11) light curves of extendedand point sources. The main motivation to develop this model was to identifyactive galactic nuclei (AGN) at different redshift ranges to be observed by the4MOST ChANGES project. Still, it serves as a more general time-domain astronomystudy. The model uses nine colors computed from CatWISE and PS1, a morphologyscore from PS1, and 61 single-band variability features computed from the ZTFDR11 g and r light curves. We trained two versions of the model, one for eachZTF band. We used a hierarchical local classifier per parent node approach,where each node was composed of a balanced random forest model. We adopted a17-class taxonomy, including non-variable stars and galaxies, three transientclasses, five classes of stochastic variables, and seven classes of periodicvariables. The macro averaged precision, recall and F1-score are 0.61, 0.75,and 0.62 for the g-band model, and 0.60, 0.74, and 0.61, for the r-band model.When grouping the four AGN classes into one single class, its precision,recall, and F1-score are 1.00, 0.95, and 0.97, respectively, for both the g andr bands. We applied the model to all the sources in the ZTF/4MOST overlappingsky, avoiding ZTF fields covering the Galactic bulge, including 86,576,577light curves in the g-band and 140,409,824 in the r-band. Only 0.73\% of theg-band light curves and 2.62\% of the r-band light curves were classified asstochastic, periodic, or transient with high probability ($P_{init}\geq0.9$).We found that, in general, more reliable results are obtained when using theg-band model. Using the latter, we identified 384,242 AGN candidates, 287,156of which have $P_{init}\geq0.9$.

  We discuss our recent constraints on the coupling of Very-Light Axion-LikeParticles (of masses $&lt;$$ 10^{-12} \ \mathrm{eV}$) to electromagnetism from$Chandra$ observations of the cluster-hosted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)H1821+643 and NGC1275. In both cases, the inferred high-quality AGN spectraexcluded all photon-ALP couplings $g_\mathrm{a\gamma} &gt; (6.3 - 8.0) \times10^{-13} \ {\mathrm{GeV}}^{-1}$ at the $99.7\%$ level, respectively, based onthe non-detection of spectral distortions attributed to photon-ALPinter-conversion along the cluster line-of-sight. Finally, we present theprospects of tightening current bounds on such ALPs by up to a factor of 10with next-generation X-ray observatories such as $Athena$, $AXIS$ and $LEM$given their improved spectral and spatial resolution and collecting areacompared to current missions.

  Although double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies have been studiedextensively in the past years, only a few are reported with the green peagalaxies (GPs). Here we present our discovery of five GPs with double-peakednarrow [OIII] emission lines, referred to as DPGPs, selected from the LAMOSTand SDSS spectroscopic surveys. We find that these five DPGPs have blueshiftednarrow components more prominent than the redshifted components, with velocityoffsets of [OIII]$\lambda$5007 lines ranging from 306 to 518 $\rm km\, s^{-1}$and full widths at half maximums (FWHMs) of individual components ranging from263 to 441 $\rm km\, s^{-1}$. By analyzing the spectra and the spectral energydistributions (SEDs), we find that they have larger metallicities and stellarmasses compared with other GPs. The H$\alpha$ line width, emission-linediagnostic, mid-infrared color, radio emission, and SED fitting provideevidence of the AGN activities in these DPGPs. They have the same spectralproperties of Type 2 quasars. Furthermore, we discuss the possible nature ofthe double-peaked narrow emission-line profiles of these DPGPs and find thatthey are more likely to be dual AGN. These DPGP galaxies are ideal laboratoriesfor exploring the growth mode of AGN in the extremely luminous emission-linegalaxies, the co-evolution between AGN and host galaxies, and the evolution ofhigh-redshift galaxies in the early Universe.

  To tackle the still unsolved and fundamental problem of the role of ActiveGalactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping galaxies, in this work we implement anew physical treatment of AGN-driven winds into our semi-analytic model ofgalaxy formation. To each galaxy in our model, we associate solutions for theoutflow expansion and the mass outflow rates in different directions, dependingon the AGN luminosity, on the circular velocity of the host halo, and on gascontent of the considered galaxy. To each galaxy we also assign an effectiveradius derived from energy conservation during merger events, and a stellarvelocity dispersion self-consistently computed via Jeans modelling. We deriveall the main scaling relations between Black hole (BH) mass and total/bulgestellar mass, velocity dispersion, host halo dark matter mass, and starformation efficiency. We find that our improved AGN feedback mostly controlsthe dispersion around the relations but plays a subdominant role in shapingslopes and/or normalizations of the scaling relations. Including possiblelimited-resolution selection biases in the model provides better agreement withthe available data. The model does not point to any more fundamental galacticproperty linked to BH mass, with velocity dispersion playing a similar rolewith respect to stellar mass, in tension with present data. In line with otherindependent studies carried out on comprehensive semi-analytic and hydrodynamicgalaxy-BH evolution models, our current results signal either an inadequacy ofpresent cosmological models of galaxy formation in fully reproducing the localscaling relations, in terms of both shape and residuals, and/or point to anincompleteness issue affecting the local sample of dynamically-measured BHs.

  We study the acceleration of charged particles by ultra-relativistic shocksusing test-particle Monte-Carlo simulations. Two field configurations areconsidered: (i) shocks with uniform upstream magnetic field in the plane of theshock, and (ii) shocks in which the upstream magnetic field has a cylindricalgeometry. Particles are assumed to diffuse in angle due to frequentnon-resonant scattering on small-scale fields. The steady-state distribution ofparticles' Lorentz factors is shown to approximately satisfy $dN/d\gamma\propto \gamma^{-2.2}$ provided the particle motion is scattering dominated onat least one side of the shock. For scattering dominated transport, theacceleration rate scales as $t_{\rm acc}\propto t^{1/2}$, though recovers Bohmscaling $t_{\rm acc}\propto t$ if particles become magnetised on one side ofthe shock. For uniform field configurations, a limiting energy is reached whenparticles are magnetised on both sides of the shock. For the cylindrical fieldconfiguration, this limit does not apply, and particles of one sign of chargewill experience a curvature drift that redirects particles upstream. For thenon-resonant scattering model considered, these particles preferentially escapeonly when they reach the confinement limit determined by the finite systemsize, and the distribution approaches the escapeless limit $dN/d\gamma \propto\gamma^{-1}$. The cylindrical field configuration resembles that expected forjets launched by the Blandford $\&amp;$ Znajek mechanism, the luminous jets of AGNand GRBs thus provide favourable sites for the production of ultra-high energycosmic rays.

  The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) found in active galactic nuclei (AGNs)are a very interesting observational phenomenon implying an unknown physicalmechanism around supermassive black holes. Several AGNs have been found to haveQPO phenomena in the X-ray energy band. Long-duration X-ray observations werecollected and reduced for six AGNs with a suspected QPO. The Gaussian process(GP) model celerite was used to fit the light curves and to search for thequasi-periodicity behavior. The power spectral density and parameter posteriordistributions of each light curve were calculated with the optimal model. Ofthe six AGNs, only RE J1034+396 was found to have a QPO of about 3600 s. Theother five sources do not show QPO modulation behavior. We propose that a hotspot on the accretion disk is a possible physical mechanism resulting in thisquasi-periodic behavior of AGNs.

  The Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) and the VLA survey in theXMM-LSS/VIDEO deep field provide deep ($\approx 15$ ${\mu}$Jybeam$^{-1}$) andhigh-resolution ($\approx$ 4.5--8 arcsec) radio coverage of the three XMM-SERVSfields (W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1, and XMM-LSS). These data cover a total sky area of11.3 deg$^2$ and contain $\approx 11000$ radio components. Furthermore, about3~deg$^2$ of the XMM-LSS field also has deeper MIGHTEE data that achieve amedian RMS of 5.6 ${\mu}$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and detect more than 20000 radiosources. We analyze all these radio data and find source counterparts at otherwavebands utilizing deep optical and IR surveys. The nature of these radiosources is studied using radio-band properties (spectral slope and morphology),and the IR-radio correlation. %and spectral energy distribution. Radio AGNs areselected and compared with those selected using other methods (e.g. X-ray). Wefound 1656 new AGNs that were not selected using X-ray and/or MIR methods. Weconstrain the FIR-to-UV SEDs of radio AGNs using {\sc cigale} and investigatethe dependence of radio AGN fraction upon galaxy stellar mass andstar-formation rate.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe are thought to beprominent sources of energy and ionizing photons that affected the growth oftheir host galaxy and their environment. However, it is still unclear how thesupermassive black holes (SMBHs) that fuel these AGN grew to the observed highmasses already at high redshifts. Observations of high-redshift SMBHprogenitors or lower-mass AGN will thus help characterize the evolution ofSMBHs and their impact on the surroundings. With the launch of the JWST,fainter objects at high redshifts can now be detected, including lower-massAGN. We assess the observability of such low luminosity AGN, using thecosmological simulation code GIZMO to provide a realistic environment for blackhole growth in the early Universe. Soon after the first stars are born in thesimulation run, we insert stellar-remnant black hole seeds of various initialmasses, between $300$ and $10^4 {\rm \ M}_{\odot}$, at the center of a darkmatter halo and follow their growth until $z\sim6$. Such stellar black holeseeds placed in a typical high-$z$ environment do not significantly accrete andgrow to reach masses that can be observed with the JWST under conditions ofstandard Bondi-Hoyle accretion, as energy input from stellar feedback andchaotic dynamics prevent efficient gas accretion onto the black holes. To beobserved with the JWST, rarer but still physically feasible growth regimes,involving Eddington or super-Eddington accretion, would be required.Alternatively, AGN observability may be boosted under even rarer conditions ofextreme gravitational lensing.
