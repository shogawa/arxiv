  Synthesis models of the diffuse Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) suggest that it can be resolved into discrete sources, primarily Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Measuring the CXB accurately offers a unique probe to study the AGN population in the nearby Universe. Current hard X-ray instruments suffer from the time-dependent background and cross-calibration issues. As a result, their measurements of the CXB normalization have an uncertainty of the order of $\sim$15%. In this paper, we present the concept and simulated performances of a CXB detector, which could be operated on different platforms. With a 16-U CubeSat mission running for more than two years in space, such a detector could measure the CXB normalization with $\sim$1% uncertainty.

  [Abridged] Using the JWST/NIRSpec observations from CEERS we found an extreme N-emitter, CEERS-1019 at z=8.6782 showing intense NIV and NIII emission. From the observed rest-UV and optical lines we conclude that it is compatible with photoionization from stars and we determine accurate abundances for C, N, O, and Ne, relative to H, finding a highly supersolar ratio log(N/O) = -0.18+/-0.11, and normal log(C/O) = -0.75+/-0.11 and log(Ne/O) = -0.63+/-0.07, for its low metallicity, 12+log(O/H)= 7.70+/-0.18. We also analyze other N-emitters from the literature. All show strongly enhanced N/O ratios and two of them normal C/O. Massive star ejecta from WR stars are needed to explain the galaxies with enhanced C/O (Lynx arc and Mrk 996). On the other hand, supermassive stars (&gt;1000 Msun, SMS) in the ``conveyer-belt model'' put forward to explain globular clusters (GCs), predict a high N/O and small changes in C/O, compatible with CEERS-1019, the Sunburst cluster, SMACS2031, and GN-z11. Based on the chemical abundances, possible enrichment scenarios, compactness, and high ISM density, we suggest that CEERS-1019, SMACS2031, and the Sunburst cluster could contain proto-GCs. Finally, we propose that some N-emitters enriched by SMS could also have formed intermediate-mass black holes, and we suggest that this might be the case for GN-z11. Our observations and analysis reinforce the suggested link between some N-emitters and proto-GC formation, which is supported both by empirical evidence and quantitative models. Furthermore, the observations provide possible evidence for the presence of supermassive stars in the early Universe (z&gt;8) and at z~2-3. Our analysis also suggests that the origin and nature of the N-emitters is diverse, including also objects like GN-z11 which possibly host an AGN.

  (Abridged) H2 is the most abundant molecule in the Universe. Thanks to its widely spaced energy levels, it predominantly lights up in warm gas, T &gt; 100 K, such as shocked regions, and it is one of the key targets of JWST observations. These include shocks from protostellar outflows, all the way up to starburst galaxies and AGN. Shock models are able to simulate H2 emission. We aim to explore H2 excitation using such models, and to test over which parameter space distinct signatures are produced in H2 emission. We present simulated H2 emission using the Paris-Durham shock code over an extensive grid of 14,000 plane-parallel stationary shock models, a large subset of which are exposed to an external UV radiation field. The grid samples 6 input parameters: preshock density, shock velocity, transverse magnetic field strength, UV radiation field strength, cosmic-ray-ionization rate, and PAH abundance. Physical quantities, such as temperature, density, and width, have been extracted along with H2 integrated line intensities. The strength of the transverse magnetic field, set by the scaling factor, b, plays a key role in the excitation of H2. At low values of b (&lt;~ 0.3, J-type shocks), H2 excitation is dominated by vibrationally excited lines; at higher values (b &gt;~ 1, C-type shocks), rotational lines dominate the spectrum for shocks with an external radiation field comparable to (or lower than) the solar neighborhood. Shocks with b &gt;= 1 can be spatially resolved with JWST for nearby objects. When the input kinetic energy flux increases, the excitation and integrated intensity of H2 increases similarly. An external UV field mainly serves to increase the excitation, particularly for shocks where the input radiation energy is comparable to the input kinetic energy flux. These results provide an overview of the energetic reprocessing of input kinetic energy flux and the resulting H2 line emission.

  Development of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) includes a series of Data Challenges (DC) arranged by various LSST Scientific Collaborations (SC) that are taking place during the projects preoperational phase. The AGN Science Collaboration Data Challenge (AGNSCDC) is a partial prototype of the expected LSST AGN data, aimed at validating machine learning approaches for AGN selection and characterization in large surveys like LSST. The AGNSC-DC took part in 2021 focusing on accuracy, robustness, and scalability. The training and the blinded datasets were constructed to mimic the future LSST release catalogs using the data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 region and the XMM-Newton Large Scale Structure Survey region. Data features were divided into astrometry, photometry, color, morphology, redshift and class label with the addition of variability features and images. We present the results of four DC submitted solutions using both classical and machine learning methods. We systematically test the performance of supervised (support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural network, convolutional neural network) and unsupervised (deep embedding clustering) models when applied to the problem of classifying/clustering sources as stars, galaxies or AGNs. We obtained classification accuracy 97.5% for supervised and clustering accuracy 96.0% for unsupervised models and 95.0% with a classic approach for a blinded dataset. We find that variability features significantly improve the accuracy of the trained models and correlation analysis among different bands enables a fast and inexpensive first order selection of quasar candidates

  Cosmological simulations fail to reproduce realistic galaxy populations without energy injection from active galactic nuclei (AGN) into the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM); a process called `AGN feedback'. Consequently, observational work searches for evidence that luminous AGN impact their host galaxies. Here, we review some of this work. Multi-phase AGN outflows are common, some with potential for significant impact. Additionally, multiple feedback channels can be observed simultaneously; e.g., radio jets from `radio quiet' quasars can inject turbulence on ISM scales, and displace CGM-scale molecular gas. However, caution must be taken comparing outflows to simulations (e.g., kinetic coupling efficiencies) to infer feedback potential, due to a lack of comparable predictions. Furthermore, some work claims limited evidence for feedback because AGN live in gas-rich, star-forming galaxies. However, simulations do not predict instantaneous, global impact on molecular gas or star formation. The impact is expected to be cumulative, over multiple episodes.

  We present the first X-ray census of fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies to conduct the deepest search for AGN and X-ray counterparts to date. Our sample includes seven well-localized FRBs with unambiguous host associations and existing deep Chandra observations, including two events for which we present new observations. We find evidence for AGN in two FRB host galaxies based on the presence of X-ray emission coincident with their centers, including the detection of a luminous ($L_X \approx 5 \times 10^{42} \ \rm erg \ s^{-1}$) X-ray source at the nucleus of FRB20190608B's host, for which we infer an SMBH mass of $\rm M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8} \ M_{\odot}$ and an Eddington ratio $L_{\rm bol}/ L_{\rm Edd} \approx 0.02$, characteristic of geometrically thin disks in Seyfert galaxies. We also report nebular emission line fluxes for 24 highly secure FRB hosts (including 10 hosts for the first time), and assess their placement on a BPT diagram, finding that FRB hosts trace the underlying galaxy population. We further find that the hosts of repeating FRBs are not confined to the star-forming locus, contrary to previous findings. Finally, we place constraints on associated X-ray counterparts to FRBs in the context of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), and find that existing X-ray limits for FRBs rule out ULXs brighter than $L_X \gtrsim 10^{40} \ \rm erg \ s^{-1}$. Leveraging the CHIME/FRB catalog and existing ULX catalogs, we search for spatially coincident ULX-FRB pairs. We identify two ULX in the galaxy NGC 2633 that are spatially coincident with the repeating FRB20180908B and for which the DM-inferred redshift is comparable to the distance of the galaxy, assuming a $\rm DM_{host}$ contribution of $150 \ \rm pc \ cm^{-3}$.
