  The spatial correlation between galaxies and the Ly$\alpha$ forest provides insights into how galaxies reionized the Universe. Here, we present initial results on the spatial cross-correlation between [OIII] emitters and Ly$\alpha$ forest at 5.4&lt;z&lt;6.5 from the JWST ASPIRE NIRCam/F356W Grism Spectroscopic Survey in z&gt;6.5 QSO fields. Using data from five QSO fields, we find $2\sigma$ evidence for excess Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission at ~20-40 cMpc around [OIII] emitters at z=5.86, indicating that [OIII] emitters reside within a highly ionized IGM. At smaller scales, the Ly$\alpha$ forest is preferentially absorbed, suggesting gas overdensities around [OIII] emitters. Comparing with models including THESAN simulations, we interpret the observed cross-correlation as evidence for significant large-scale fluctuations of the IGM and the late end of reionization at z&lt;6, characterized by ionized bubbles over 50 cMpc around [OIII] emitters. The required UV background necessitates an unseen population of faint galaxies around the [OIII] emitters. Furthermore, we find that the number of observed [OIII] emitters near individual transmission spikes is insufficient to sustain reionization in their surroundings, even assuming all [OIII] emitters harbour AGN with 100 % LyC escape fractions. Despite broad agreement, a careful analysis of ASPIRE and THESAN, using the observed host halo mass from the clustering of [OIII] emitters, suggests that the simulations underpredict the observed excess IGM transmission around [OIII] emitters, challenging our model of reionization. Potential solutions include larger ionized bubbles at z&lt;6, more enhanced large-scale UV background or temperature fluctuations of the IGM, and possibly a patchy early onset of reionization at z&gt;10. Current observational errors are dominated by cosmic variance, meaning future analyses of more QSO fields from JWST will improve the results.

  The driving force behind outflows, often invoked to understand the correlation between the supermassive black holes powering active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxy properties, remains uncertain. We provide new insights into the mechanisms that trigger warm ionized outflows in AGN, based on findings from the MaNGA survey. Our sample comprises 538 AGN with strong [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission lines, of which 197 are detected in radio and 341 are radio-undetected. We analyzed [OIII]$\lambda$5007 line in summed spectra, extracted over their central 500$\times$500 pc$^2$ region. The calculated Balmer 4000 $\AA$ break, D$_n$4000 is larger than 1.45 for $\sim$95$\%$ of the sources indicating that the specific star-formation rate in their central regions is smaller than 10$^{-11.5}$ yr$^{-1}$, pointing to evidence of negative AGN feedback suppressing star-formation. Considering the whole sample, radio-detected sources show an increased outflow detection rate (56$\pm$7\%) compared to radio-undetected sources (25$\pm$3\%). They also show higher velocity, mass outflow rate, outflow power and outflow momentum rate. We noticed a strong correlation between outflow characteristics and bolometric luminosity in both samples, except that the correlation is steeper for the radio-detected sample. Our findings suggest (a) warm ionized outflows are prevalent in all types of AGN, (b) radiation from AGN is the primary driver of these outflows, (c) radio jets are likely to play a secondary role in enhancing the gas kinematics over and above that caused by radiation, and (d) very low star-formation in the central regions of the galaxies, possibly due to negative feedback of AGN activity.

  We study the black hole mass $-$ host galaxy stellar mass relation, $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$, for a sample of 706 $z \lesssim 1.5$ and $i \lesssim 24$ optically-variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in three Dark Energy Survey (DES) deep fields: C3, X3, E2, which partially cover Chandra Deep Field-South, XMM Large Scale Structure survey, and European Large Area ISO Survey, respectively. The parent sample was identified by optical variability from the DES supernova survey program imaging. Using publicly available spectra and photometric catalogs, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts, estimate their black hole masses using broad line widths and luminosities, and obtain improved stellar masses using spectral energy distribution fitting from X-ray to mid-infrared wavelengths. Our results confirm previous work from Hyper-Suprime Camera imaging that variability searches with deep, high-precision photometry can reliably identify AGNs in low-mass galaxies up to $z\sim1$. However, we find that the hosted black holes are overmassive than predicted by the local AGN relation, fixing host galaxy stellar mass. Instead, $z\sim 0.1-1.5$ variability-selected AGNs lie in between the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation for local inactive early-type galaxies and local active galaxies. This result agrees with most previous studies of $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation for AGNs at similar redshifts, regardless of selection technique. We demonstrate that studies of variability selected AGN provide critical insights into the low-mass end of the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation, shedding light on the occupation fraction of that provides constraints on early BH seeding mechanisms and self-regulated feedback processes during their growth and co-evolution with their hosts.
