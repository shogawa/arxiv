  We present hydrodynamic simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) within the circumnuclear disk (CND) of a typical AGN-dominated galaxy influenced by mechanical feedback from an active galactic nucleus(AGN). The simulations are coupled with the CHIMES non-equilibrium chemistry network to treat the radiative-cooling and AGN-heating. A focus is placed on the central 100 pc scale where AGN outflows are coupled to the ISM and constrained by observational Seyfert-2 galaxies. AGN-feedback models are implemented with different wind-velocity and mass-loading factors. We post-process the simulation snapshots with a radiative-transfer code to obtain the molecular emission lines. We find that the inclusion of an AGN promotes the formation of CO in clumpy and dense regions surrounding supermassive-blackholes (SMBH). The CO(1-0) intensity maps ($&lt;$6 Myr) in the CND seem to match well with observations of NGC 1068 with a best match for a model with 5000 $\rm km/s$ wind-velocity and a high mass-loading factor. We attempt to discern between competing explanations for the apparent counter-rotating gas disk in the NGC 1068 through an analysis of kinematic maps of the CO line emission. We suggest that mechanical AGN-feedback could explain the alignment-stability of position-angle across the different CND radii around the SMBH through momentum and energy loading of the wind. It is the wind-velocity that drives the disk out of alignment on a 100 pc scale for a long period of time. The position-velocity diagrams are in broad agreement with the predicted Keplerian rotation-curve in the model without-AGN, but the AGN models exhibit a larger degree of scatter, in better agreement with NGC 1068 observations.

  We present second epoch optical spectra for 30 changing-look (CL) candidates found by searching for Type-1 optical variability in a sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) spectroscopically classified as Type 2. We use a random-forest-based light curve classifier and spectroscopic follow-up, confirming 50 per cent of candidates as turning-on CLs. In order to improve this selection method and to better understand the nature of the not-confirmed CL candidates, we perform a multi-wavelength variability analysis including optical, mid-infrared (MIR) and X-ray data, and compare the results from the confirmed and not-confirmed CLs identified in this work. We find that most of the not-confirmed CLs are consistent with weak Type 1s dominated by host-galaxy contributions, showing weaker optical and MIR variability. On the contrary, the confirmed CLs present stronger optical fluctuations and experience a long (from five to ten years) increase in their MIR fluxes and the colour W1-W2 over time. In the 0.2-2.3 keV band, at least four out of 11 CLs with available SRG/eROSITA detections have increased their flux in comparison with archival upper limits. These common features allow us to select the most promising CLs from our list of candidates, leading to nine sources with similar multi-wavelength photometric properties to our CL sample. The use of machine learning algorithms with optical and MIR light curves will be very useful to identify CLs in future large-scale surveys.

  Coronal-Line Forest Active Galactic Nuclei (CLiF AGN) are characterized by strong, high-ionization lines, which are in contrast to what is found in typical AGNs. Here, we carry out an infrared analysis aimed at understanding the spectral energy distribution of six sources from this group. In this work, the properties of the dusty torus for these objects are analyzed. To this purpose, we infer the physical and geometrical properties of the dust structure that surrounds the central region by fitting with models the spectral energy distribution (SED) of CLiF AGNs in the infrared. For this analysis, we compare the results of three models: CLUMPY, SKIRTOR and CAT3D-WIND. Using the Bayesian information criterion, SKIRTOR was found to have the most robust fit to the SEDs in five out of six galaxies. The remaining object was best fitted with CLUMPY. The results indicate that these objects are preferentially Type~I sources, supporting the detection of broad components in the permitted lines, likely associated with the BLR in the near-infrared (NIR) spectra. The best SED fitting indicates that the line of sight gives access to the view of the central source for these objects, but the amount of dusty clouds in the same direction is high, suggesting the hypothesis that they obscure the emission of the continuum produced by the central source and that the obscuration makes the coronal lines to not overlap with the continuum.
