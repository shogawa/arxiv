  The outflowing molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk (CND) of the nearby (D=14 Mpc) AGN-starburst composite galaxy NGC 1068 is considered as a manifestation of ongoing AGN feedback. The large spread of velocities from the outflowing gas is likely driving various kinds of shock chemistry across the CND. We performed a multiline molecular study using CH3OH with the aim of characterizing the gas properties probed by CH3OH in the CND of NGC 1068, and investigating its potential association with molecular shocks. Multi-transition CH3OH were imaged at the resolution of 0.''5-0.''8 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We performed non-LTE radiative transfer analysis coupled with a Bayesian inference process in order to determine the gas properties such as the gas volume density and the gas kinetic temperature. The gas densities traced by CH3OH point to $\sim 10^{6}$ cm\textsuperscript{-3} across all the CND regions. The gas kinetic temperature cannot be well constrained in any of the CND regions though the inferred temperature is likely low ($\lesssim 100$ K).The low gas temperature traced by CH3OH suggests shocks and subsequent fast cooling as the origin of the observed gas-phase CH3OH abundance. We also note that the E-/A- isomer column density ratio inferred is fairly close to unity, which is interestingly different from the Galactic measurements in the literature. It remains inconclusive whether CH3OH exclusively traces slow and non-dissociative shocks, or whether the CH3OH abundance can actually be boosted in both fast and slow shocks.

  We present the discovery of large radio shells around a massive pair of interacting galaxies and extended diffuse X-ray emission within the shells. The radio data were obtained with the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) in two frequency bands centred at 944 MHz and 1.4 GHz, respectively, while the X-ray data are from the XMM-Newton observatory. The host galaxy pair, which consists of the early-type galaxies ESO 184-G042 and LEDA 418116, is part of a loose group at a distance of only 75 Mpc (redshift z = 0.017). The observed outer radio shells (diameter ~ 145 kpc) and ridge-like central emission of the system, ASKAP J1914-5433 (Physalis), are likely associated with merger shocks during the formation of the central galaxy (ESO 184-G042) and resemble the new class of odd radio circles (ORCs). This is supported by the brightest X-ray emission found offset from the centre of the Physalis system, instead centered at the less massive galaxy, LEDA 418116. The host galaxy pair is embedded in an irregular envelope of diffuse light, highlighting on-going interactions. We complement our combined radio and X-ray study with high-resolution simulations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxy mergers from the Magneticum project to analyse the evolutionary state of the Physalis system. We argue that ORCs / radio shells could be produced by a combination of energy release from the central AGN and subsequent lightening up in radio emission by merger shocks traveling through the CGM of these systems.

  Gravitational instability in the outskirts of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks lead to disk fragmentation and formation of super-massive (several 10^2Msun) stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex-situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged due to recycling of hydrogen rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched towards smaller radii resembling a classical star-burst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses of \sim 10^6 to 10^8Msun accreting at \sim 0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 10^3 to 10^5 coexisting massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10^-3 to 1 per year. We motivate the detailed study of interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.
