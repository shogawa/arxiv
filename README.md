  We study outflows in 130 galaxies with -22&lt;MUV&lt;-16 at z=3-9 identified in JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam WFSS data taken by the ERO, CEERS, FRESCO, GLASS, and JADES programs. We identify 30 out of the 130 galaxies with broad components of FWHM~200-700 km/s in the emission lines of H${\alpha}$ and [OIII] that trace ionized outflows, and find no excesses from the star-formation main sequence. Four out of the 30 outflowing galaxies are Type 1 AGN whose H${\alpha}$ emission lines include line profile components as broad as FWHM&gt;1000 km/s. With the velocity shift and line widths of the outflow broad lines, we obtain ~80-500 km/s for the outflow velocities. We find that the outflow velocities as a function of star-formation rate are comparable to or higher than those of galaxies at z~1, accounting for the selection bias, while the outflow velocities of AGN are large but not significantly different from the others. Interestingly, these outflow velocities are typically not high enough to escape from the galactic potentials, suggestive of fountain-type outflows, which are concluded on the basis of thorough comparisons with recent JWST results. We estimate mass loading factors ${\eta}$ to be 0.1-1 that are not particularly large, but comparable with those of z~1 outflows. The large fraction of galaxies with outflows (30% with high resolution data) provides constraints on outflow parameters, suggesting a wide opening angle of &gt;45 deg and a large duty-cycle of &gt;30%, which gives a picture of more frequent and spherical outflows in high-z galaxies.

  Context. Quasar outflows are often analyzed to determine their ability to contribute to active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. We have identified a broad absorption line (BAL) outflow in the VLT/UVES spectrum of the quasar SDSS J1321-0041. The outflow shows troughs from Fe II, and is therefore identified as an FeLoBAL. It is quite extreme among that population, as it shows C II and Si II BALs. Aims. Outflow systems require a kinetic luminosity above $\sim0.5\%$ of the quasar's luminosity to contribute to AGN feedback. For this reason, we analyzed the spectrum of J1321-0041 to determine the outflow's kinetic luminosity, as well as the quasar's bolometric luminosity. Methods. We measured the ionic column densities from the absorption troughs in the spectrum, and determined the Hydrogen column density and ionization parameter using those column densities as our constraints. We also determined the electron number density $n_e$ based on the ratios between excited state and resonance state column densities of Fe II and Si II. This allowed us to find the distance of the outflow from its central source, as well as its kinetic luminosity. Results. We determined the kinetic luminosity of the outflow to be $8.4^{+13.2}_{-5.3}\times 10^{45}\text{ erg s}^{-1}$, and the quasar's bolometric luminosity to be $1.72\pm0.13\times10^{47}\text{ erg s}^{-1}$, resulting in a ratio of $\dot{E}_k/L_{Bol}=4.8^{+7.7}_{-3.1}\%$. We conclude that this outflow has sufficient kinetic luminosity to contribute to AGN feedback.

  Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The algorithms can distinguish between different source types, such as blazars and pulsars, and help uncover new insights into the high-energy universe. The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi Gamma-ray telescope has significantly advanced our understanding of the Universe. The instrument has detected a large number of gamma-ray emitting sources, among which a significant number of objects have been identified as active galactic nuclei (AGN). The sample is primarily composed of blazars; however, more than one-third of these sources are either of an unknown class or lack a definite association with a low-energy counterpart. In this work, we employ multiple machine learning algorithms to classify the sources based on their other physical properties. In particular, we utilized smart initialisation techniques and self-supervised learning for classifying blazars into BL Lacertae objects (BL Lac) and flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ). The core advantage of the algorithm is its simplicity, usage of minimum number of features and easy deployment due to lesser number of parameters without compromising on the performance. The model predicts that out of the 1115 sources of uncertain type in the 4FGL-DR3 catalog, 820 can be classified as BL Lacs, and 295 can be classified as FSRQs.

  Using the multi-epoch mid-infrared (MIR) photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer spanning a baseline of $\sim10$ yr, we extensively investigate the MIR variability of nearby active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at $0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.4$. We find that the ensemble structure function in the W1 band ($3.4\ \mu$m) can be modeled with a broken power law. Type 1 AGNs tend to exhibit larger variability amplitudes than type 2 AGNs, possibly due to the extinction by the torus. The variability amplitude is inversely correlated with the AGN luminosity, consistent with a similar relation known in the optical. Meanwhile, the slope of the power law increases with AGN luminosity. This trend can be attributed to the fact that the inner radius of the torus is proportional to the AGN luminosity, as expected from the size$-$luminosity relation of the torus. Interestingly, low-luminosity type 2 AGNs, unlike low-luminosity type 1 AGNs, tend to exhibit smaller variability amplitude than do high-luminosity AGNs. We argue that either low-luminosity type 2 AGNs have distinctive central structures due to their low luminosity or their MIR brightness is contaminated by emission from the cold dust in the host galaxy. Our findings suggest that the AGN unification scheme may need to be revised. We find that the variability amplitude of dust-deficient AGNs is systematically larger than that of normal AGNs, supporting the notion that the hot and warm dust in dust-deficient AGNs may be destroyed and reformed according to the strength of the ultraviolet radiation from the accretion disk.

  We present a multiwavelength observation of a cool core that does not appear to be associated with any galaxy, in a nearby cluster, Abell~1142. Its X-ray surface brightness peak of $\lesssim2$ keV is cooler than the ambient intracluster gas of $\gtrsim3$ keV, and is offset from its brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) by 80 kpc in projection, representing the largest known cool core -- BCG separation. This BCG-less cool core allows us to measure the metallicity of a cluster center with a much-reduced contribution from the interstellar medium (ISM) of the BCG. XMM-Newton observation reveals a prominent Fe abundance peak of $1.07^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ Z$_{\odot}$ and an $\alpha/$Fe abundance ratio close to the solar ratio, fully consistent with those found at the centers of typical cool core clusters. This finding hints that BCGs play a limited role in enriching the cluster centers. However, the discussion remains open, given that the $\alpha/$Fe abundance ratios of the orphan cool core and the BCG ISM are not significantly different. Abell~1142 may have experienced a major merger more than 100 Myr ago, which has dissociated its cool core from the BCG. This implies that the Fe abundance peak in cool core clusters can be resilient to cluster mergers. Our recent IRAM 30-m observation did not detect any CO emission at its X-ray peak and we find no evidence for massive runaway cooling in the absence of recent AGN feedback. The lack of a galaxy may contribute to an inefficient conversion of the ionized warm gas to the cold molecular gas.

  The accretion disks that fuel active galactic nuclei (AGN) may house numerous stars and compact objects, formed in situ or captured from nearby star clusters. Embedded neutron stars and black holes may form binaries and eventually merge, emitting gravitational waves detectable by LIGO/VIRGO. AGN disks are a particularly promising environment for the production of high-mass gravitational wave events involving black holes in the pair instability mass gap, and may facilitate electromagnetic counterparts to black hole binary mergers. However, many orders of magnitude separate the typical length scales of binary formation and those on which gravitational waves can drive binary inspirals, making binary mergers inside the disk uncertain. Previous hydrodynamical simulations of binaries have either been restricted to two dimensions entirely, or focused on binaries aligned with the midplane of the disk. Herein we present the first three-dimensional, high-resolution, local shearing-box hydrodynamical simulations of disk-embedded binaries over a range of orbital inclinations. We find that retrograde binaries can shrink up to four times as quickly as prograde binaries, and that all binaries not perfectly aligned (or anti-aligned) with the AGN disk are driven into alignment. An important consequence of this is that initially retrograde binaries will traverse the inclinations where von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations can drive binary eccentricities to large values, potentially facilitating mergers. We also find that interactions with the AGN disk may excite eccentricities in retrograde binaries and cause the orbits of embedded binaries to precess.

  Many stellar-mass Black Holes (sBHs) are expected to orbit supermassive black holes at galactic centers. For galaxies with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), it is likely that the sBHs reside in a disk. We study the formation of sBH binaries via gravitational wave emission in such disks. We examine analytically the dynamics of two sBHs orbiting a supermassive black hole, estimate the capture cross-section, and derive the eccentricity distribution of bound binaries at different frequency bands. Thus, we estimate that $\sim 50\%$ of the merging stellar-mass black hole binaries, assembled in this manner, have high eccentricities, $e\gtrsim0.5$, in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA band. A considerable fraction of these mergers leads to a direct plunge rather than an eccentric inspiral. More eccentric mergers would be observed for sBHs with higher random velocities, closer to the supermassive black hole, or at lower observing frequency bands, as planned in future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA.

  The physical quantity that directly controls the feedback of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in galactic nuclei (AGN) in elliptical galaxies remains to be determined. The discovery of molecular gas around the AGNs suggests that the gas is fueling the AGNs. Therefore, we analyze Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data on CO line (J=1-0, 2-1, 3-2) emission and estimate the mass of molecular gas within 500pc of the center of 12 normal elliptical galaxies and 10 of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We find that the mass (M_mol~10^5-10^9 M_sun) has a correlation with the jet power of their AGNs, which is represented by P_cav~6.2x10^42(M_mol/10^7M_sun)^{0.68} erg s^{-1}. We also find that M_mol is correlated with the AGN continuum luminosities at ~1.4GHz (L_{1.4}) and ~100-300GHz (L_con). Since P_cav reflects galactic-scale, long-term AGN activity, while the continuum luminosities reflect local (~&lt;500pc), short-term AGN activity, our results suggest that the AGN activity depends on the amount of the gas, regardless of its time scale. On the other hand, we cannot find a clear correlation between the mass of the black holes in the AGNs (M_BH) and P_cav. While this is probably because the black holes in our sample galaxies have similar masses, it suggests that M_mol, rather than M_BH, is the main factor that controls the AGN activity. We confirm that the origin of the continuum emission from the AGNs at ~1.4-300GHz is mostly synchrotron radiation.
