  Changing-look (CL) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), characterized by appearance/disappearance of broad emission lines in the span of a few years, present a challenge for the AGN unified model, whereby the Type 1 vs. Type 2 dichotomy results from orientation effects alone. We present a systematic study of a large sample of spectroscopically classified AGNs, using optical variability data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) as well as follow-up spectroscopy data. We demonstrate that Type 1 vs. 2 AGN can be neatly separated on the basis of the variability metric $\sigma_{\rm QSO}$, which quantifies the resemblance of a light curve to a damp random walk model. For a small sub-sample, however, the ZTF light curves are inconsistent with their previous classification, suggesting the occurrence of a CL event. Specifically, we identify 35 (12) turn-on (turn-off) CL AGN candidates at $z &lt; 0.35$. Based on follow-up spectroscopy, we confirm 17 (4) turn-on (turn-off) CL AGNs out of 21 (5) candidates, presenting a high success rate of our method. Our results suggest that the occurrence rate of CL AGNs is $\sim$0.3% over timescales of 5 to 20 years, and confirm that the CL transition typically occurs at the Eddington ratio of $\leq 0.01$.

  The fundamental plane of back hole activity (BHFP) describes the correlation between radio luminosity ($L_R$), X-ray luminosity ($L_X$), and black hole mass ($M_{BH}$). It reflects a connection between accretion disc and jet. However, the dependence of the BHFP on various physical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and host galaxies remains unclear, especially for low-luminosity AGNs. From the deep and large multi-wavelength surveys in the GOODS-N, GOODS-S, and COSMOS/UltraVISTA fields, we constructed a large and homogeneous radio AGN sample including 208 objects. We divided this sample into 141 radio-quiet (RQ) AGNs and 67 radio-loud (RL) AGNs according to the radio-loudness defined by the ratio of $L_R$ to $L_X$. The $L_R$-to-$L_X$ ratio shows a bimodal distribution that is well described by two single Gaussian models. Their cross point corresponds to a radio-loudness threshold of $\log (L_R/L_X)=-2.73$. The RQ AGNs have larger Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$) than the RL AGNs. Our RQ and RL AGNs show different BHFPs that are $\log L_R=(0.55\pm 0.05)\log L_X+(0.28\pm 0.06)\log M_{BH}+(13.54\pm 2.27)$ and $\log L_R=(0.82\pm 0.08)\log L_X+(0.07\pm 0.08)\log M_{BH}+(5.24\pm 3.33)$, respectively. For both RQ and RL AGNs, the BHFP does not show a significant dependence on redshift and galaxy star-formation properties, while it shows a significant dependence on $\lambda_{Edd}$. The BHFP sheds important light on the accretion physics of central engines. RQ AGNs at $0.01&lt;\lambda_{Edd}&lt;0.1$ agree with the advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) coupled with a synchrotron jet model, while at $0.1&lt;\lambda_{Edd}&lt; 1$, they mainly follow the jet model. RL AGNs are consistent with a combination of ADAF and jet model at $\lambda_{Edd}&lt;0.01$, and agree with the jet model at $0.01&lt;\lambda_{Edd}&lt;0.1$, and follow a combination of the standard thin disc and jet model at $\lambda_{Edd}&gt;0.1$.
