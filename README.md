  The frequency of compact object interactions in AGN discs is naturally tied to the number of objects embedded within it. We investigate the evolution of black holes in the nuclear stellar cluster on inclined orbits to the AGN disc by performing adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc crossings over a range of disc densities and inclinations $i\in[2^\circ,15^\circ]$. We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake that forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We identify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry of the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake morphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The inclination damping $\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as a power law in $\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\text{H,0}$ as $\Delta i/i \propto m_{\rm H,0}^{0.4} \sin(i)^{-2.7}$. The drag on the BH is dominated by the gravity of the wake for the majority of our inclination range until accretion effects become comparable at $\sin(i)\gtrsim30H_0/R_0$, where $H_0/R_0$ is the disc aspect ratio. At low inclinations ($\sin(i)\lesssim3H_0/R_0$) the wake morphology becomes more spherical, leading to a regime change in the inclination damping behaviour. Our results suggest that the inclination damping timescale is shorter than expected from only episodic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttelton accretion events during each transit, implying inclined objects may captured by the AGN disc earlier in its lifetime than previously thought.

  AT2022rze is a luminous, ambiguous transient located South-East of the geometric center of its host galaxy at redshift z = 0.08. The host appears to be formed by a merging galaxy system. The observed characteristics of AT2022rze are reminiscent of active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events (TDEs), and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of -20.2 +- 0.2 mag, showing a sharp rise (trise,1/e = 27.5 +- 0.6 days) followed by a slow decline (tdec,1/e = 382.9 +- 0.6). Its bumpy light curve and narrow Balmer lines indicate the presence of gas (and dust). Its light curve shows rather red colors, indicating that the transient could be affected by significant host extinction. The spectra reveal coronal lines, indicative of high-energy (X-ray/UV) emission. Archival data reveal no prior activity at this location, disfavoring a steady-state AGN, although an optical spectrum obtained prior to the transient is consistent with an AGN classification of the host. Based on this, we conclude that the transient most likely represents a Changing-look AGN at the center of the smallest component of the merging system.

  Intensive reverberation mapping monitoring programs combine ground-based photometric observations from different telescopes, requiring intercalibration of lightcurves to reduce systematic instrumental differences. We present a new iterative algorithm to calibrate photometric time-series data of active galactic nuclei (AGN) using 100s of comparison stars on the same images, building upon the established method of ensemble photometry. The algorithm determines telescope-specific and epoch-specific correction parameters, and simultaneously computes a multi-component noise model to account for underestimated uncertainties based on the scatter in the comparison star data, effectively identifying problematic epochs, telescopes, and stars. No assumptions need to be made about the AGN variability shape, and the algorithm can in principle be applied to any astronomical object. We demonstrate our method on lightcurves taken with ten 1-m telescopes from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) robotic telescope network. Comparing our results to other intercalibration tools, we find that the algorithm can more accurately quantify the uncertainties in the data. We describe additional corrections that can be made for particularly bluer AGNs like Fairall 9, arising due to systematic effects dependent on star colour.

  We present an investigation of the compact structure of the AGN 2021+317 based on multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at 15, 22, and 43 GHz in the period from 2013 through 2024. The VLBI images show a core-jet structure extended to the south, with two stationary components in the northern region, one of which likely to be the core of the source. We also detected two new moving jet components (S4 and S5) in the observations of 2021. Based on these observational findings, we analyzed two distinctive jet models, involving one or another stationary component mentioned above as the jet core. One model assumes a moderate bulk motion velocity, a wider viewing angle, and a lower Doppler factor, with the magnetic field energy density significantly dominating over non-thermal particle energy density. The other model involves a higher bulk motion velocity, a narrower viewing angle, and a higher Doppler factor, with an even greater dominance of magnetic field energy in the core. The position angle of the jet ridge line rotates counter-clockwise over the observed period. The apparent kinematics of the jet components is more consistent with a model of the precessing jet, which has recently completed the first half of the precession cycle. Our results provide constraints on the dynamic evolution of the jet and its interaction with the surrounding medium.

  Knowledge of the broad-band active galactic nuclei (AGN) spectral energy distribution (SED) that ionizes the gas-rich broad emission line region is key to understanding the various radiative processes at play and their importance that eventually leads to the emission line formation. We modeled a spectral energy distribution for highly accreting quasars, also known as extreme population A sources, based mainly on observational data available in astronomical databases, and on accretion disk models for the unobservable far-UV domain. Our selection criterion is the RFeII parameter - the ratio of the optical FeII emission between 4434 A and 4684 A to the H-beta 4861 A intensity, RFeII &gt; 1. This criterion is satisfied by highly-accreting, possibly super-Eddington, black holes. We analyzed 155 sources up to a redshift of approximately 1, previously reported in the literature, to construct a median radio-quiet SED spanning from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We find that the SED of quasars exhibits distinct features compared to lower accreting AGN, including a pronounced big blue bump and strong optical/UV emission along with a steep X-ray continuum. We classify the sources into radio-quiet, radio-intermediate, and radio-loud categories, observing that radio-intermediate and a subsample of radio-quiet AGN show a significant far-IR excess over the radio-quiet SED and the far-IR excess appears to be related to the prominence of Feii emission. There is an overall consistency between the new SED and the one obtained for high Eddington ratio quasars in previous work. We provide the SEDs in digital format for eventual applications.
