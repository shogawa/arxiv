  We present results from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) multi-frequency (1.6, 4.4, 8.6, 22 GHz), high-sensitivity (~25 microJy beam^-1), sub-parsec scale (&lt;1 pc) observations and Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) for a sample of 12 local active galactic nuclei (AGNs), a subset from our previous volume-complete sample with hard X-ray (14-195 keV) luminosities above 10^42 erg s^-1, out to a distance of 40 Mpc. All 12 of the sources presented here were detected in the C (4.4 GHz) and X (8.6 GHz) bands, 75% in the L band(1.6 GHz), and 50% in the K band (22 GHz). Most sources showed compact, resolved/slightly resolved, central sub-parsec scale radio morphology, except a few with extended outflow-like features. A couple of sources have an additional component that may indicate the presence of a dual-core, single or double-sided jet or a more intricate feature, such as radio emission resulting from interaction with nearby ISM. The spectral slopes are mostly GHz-peaked or curved, with a few showing steep, flat, or inverted spectra. We found that in the sub-parsec scale, the GHz-peaked spectra belong to the low-accreting, radio-loud AGNs with a tendency to produce strong outflows, possibly small-scale jet, and/or have a coronal origin. In contrast, flat/inverted spectra suggest compact radio emission from highly-accreting AGNs' central region, possibly associated with radio-quiet AGNs producing winds/shocks or nuclear star formation in the vicinity of black holes.

  The observational data of high redshift galaxies become increasingly abundant, especially since the operation of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which allows us to verify and optimize the galaxy formation model at high redshifts. In this work, we investigate the merging history of massive galaxies at $3 &lt; z &lt; 6$ using a well-developed semi-analytic galaxy formation catalogue. We find that the major merger rate increases with redshift up to 3 and then flattens. The fraction of wet mergers, during which the sum of the cold gas mass is higher than the sum of the stellar mass in two merging galaxies, also increases from $\sim$ 34\% at $z = 0$ to 96\% at $z = 3$. Interestingly, almost all major mergers are wet at $z &gt; 3$ . This can be attributed to the high fraction ($&gt; 50\%$) of cold gas at $z &gt; 3$. In addition, we study some special systems of massive merging galaxies at $3 &lt; z &lt; 6$, including the massive gas-rich major merging systems and extreme dense proto-clusters, and investigate the supermassive black hole-dark matter halo mass relation and dual AGNs. We find that the galaxy formation model reproduces the incidence of those observed massive galaxies, but fails to reproduce the relation between the supermassive black hole mass and the dark matter halo mass at $z \sim 6$. The latter requires more careful estimates of the supermassive black hole masses observationally. Otherwise, it could suggest modifications of the modeling of the supermassive black hole growth at high redshifts.
