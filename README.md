The redshifted 21-cm signal emitted by neutral Hydrogen (HI) is a promising probe to understand the evolution of the topology of ionized regions during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The topology of ionized regions allows us to infer the nature and properties of ionizing sources, i.e., early galaxies and AGNs. Traditional Fourier statistics, such as the power spectrum, help us quantify the strength of fluctuations in this field at different length scales but do not preserve its phase information. Analyzing the 21-cm brightness temperature field in the image domain retains its non-Gaussian characteristics and morphological information. One such approach is to track the coalescence of multiple ionized regions to form one contiguous ionized region spanning the universe. This is referred to as percolation, and its onset is quantified by a sharp rise in the value of the Largest Cluster Statistic (LCS) approaching unity. In this work, we carry out a percolation analysis of 21-cm brightness temperature fields by studying the redshift evolution of the LCS along a lightcone to distinguish between several simulated reionization scenarios. We have extended previous results on reionization model comparison from the analysis of coeval 21-cm maps to understand how the lightcone effect biases the observed percolation behavior and affects the distinguishability of the source models. We estimate the LCS of subvolumes of different sizes in the 21-cm lightcone maps and study their redshift evolution for different reionization scenarios using a moving volume approach. We find that the percolation transition inferred from a lightcone approaches that from the coeval box as we increase the bandwidth of the moving volume in all but one reionization scenario.

We present an in-depth Chandra X-ray analysis of the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0417$-$4748 (hereafter SPT J0417), at z = 0.58, with a focus on its thermodynamic properties and the apparent absence of central star formation. Utilizing a total Chandra exposure of 103 ks, we find that the large-scale X-ray morphology is consistent with a dynamically relaxed, cool-core system. The intracluster medium (ICM) shows a central density of 0.08+/-0.01 cm^{-3}, a central pseudo-entropy of 26^{+6}_{-5} keVcm^{2} and a central cooling time of 515^{+96}_{-75} Myr, values typical of massive cool-core clusters. Despite these conditions, no evidence of recent or ongoing star formation is detected in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of DES photometry indicates that the bulk of the stellar population formed at z~1.25, with no significant star formation over the past ~3 Gyr, while optical spectra from Magellan show no [O II] emission. Complementary ASKAP radio and Spitzer infrared data indicate a lack of strong current AGN activity in the BCG. SPT J0417 exemplifies massive, relaxed, cool-core clusters in which cooling and star formation appear almost completely quenched, providing valuable insights into how AGN feedback regulates the long-term thermal balance of the intracluster medium.

We investigate the growth of central supermassive black holes in galaxies, aiming to distinguish between gas accretion versus BH merger-driven growth modes. By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of $(50 ~ {\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as $10^5 M_{\odot}$ seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to $\sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after $7-9$ Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of $600 - 700$ Myr, when the BH mass increases $10^2 - 10^3$ times, causing their predominant growth from $10^7 M_{\odot}$ to $(10^9 - 10^{10}) M_{\odot}$. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than $10^{10} M_{\odot}$ by $z=0$, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\star}$ relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-$z$ Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion.

We investigate how pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements of the nanoHertz gravitational-wave background (GWB) can constrain models for the growth history of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and how active galactic nucleus (AGN) and stellar feedback models can affect GWB predictions. Feedback regulates supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth, altering the black hole mass function (BHMF). Using BHMFs drawn from multiple cosmological simulation suites including IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, Simba, and CAMELS, and combining these with a quasar-based SMBH binary population framework, we predict the resulting GWB amplitude under a range of different stellar and AGN feedback prescriptions. We find that the choice of both stellar and AGN feedback models alters the high-mass end of the BHMF and changes the predicted GWB amplitude by up to a factor of 2 for the fiducial simulations and a factor 10 for extreme feedback variations in CAMELS. Models with inefficient or absent AGN feedback produce abundant SMBHs and yield GWB amplitudes consistent with PTA data, yet fail in producing realistic galaxies. Fiducial models of AGN and stellar feedback suppress SMBH growth too much and under-predict the expected signal, an effect which could possibly be mitigated by more realistic black hole seeding and growth prescriptions. The mismatch between the GWB amplitudes predicted by cosmological simulations and those observed by PTAs suggests that SMBH growth is more efficient or occurs earlier than captured by current models. This demonstrates that PTA measurements provide a powerful new probe of feedback physics and the SMBH population.
