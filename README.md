  We present polarization images with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in A and B-array configurations at 6 GHz of 7 radio-loud (RL) quasars and 8 BL Lac objects belonging to the Palomar-Green (PG) `blazar' sample. This completes our arcsecond-scale polarization study of an optically-selected volume-limited blazar sample comprising 16 radio-loud quasars and 8 BL Lac objects. Using the VLA, we identify kpc-scale polarization in the cores and jets/lobes of all the blazars, with fractional polarization varying from around $0.8 \pm 0.3$% to $37 \pm 6$%. The kpc-scale jets in PG RL quasars are typically aligned along their parsec-scale jets and show apparent magnetic fields parallel to jet directions in their jets/cores and magnetic field compression in their hotspots. The quasars show evidence of interaction with their environment as well as restarted AGN activity through morphology, polarization and spectral indices. These quasi-periodic jet modulations and restarted activity may be indicative of an unstable accretion disk undergoing transition. We find that the polarization characteristics of the BL Lacs are consistent with their jets being reoriented multiple times, with no correlation between their core apparent magnetic field orientations and pc-scale jet directions. We find that the low synchrotron peaked BL Lacs show polarization and radio morphology features typical of `strong' jet sources as defined by Meyer et al. (2011) for the `blazar envelope scenario', which posits a division based on jet profiles and velocity gradients rather than total jet power.

  Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a promising method for studying sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are a challenging detection target. While extensive searches have been made in the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands, systematic infrared (IR) studies remain limited. Using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), which provides unique decade-long mid-IR light curves with a six-month cadence, we have conducted the first systematic search for SMBHB candidates based on IR periodicity. Analyzing a parent sample of 48,932 objects selected from about half a million AGNs, we have identified 28 candidate periodic AGNs with periods ranging from 1,268 to 2,437 days (in the observer frame) by fitting their WISE light curves with sinusoidal functions. However, our mock simulation of the parent sample indicates that stochastic variability can actually produce a similar number of periodic sources, underscoring the difficulty in robustly identifying real periodic signals with WISE light curves, given their current sampling. Notably, we found no overlap between our sample and optical periodic sources, which can be explained by a distinct preference for certain periods due to selection bias. By combining archived data from different surveys, we have identified SDSS J140336.43+174136.1 as a candidate exhibiting periodic behavior in both optical and IR bands, a phenomenon that warrants further validation through observational tests. Our results highlight the potential of IR time-domain surveys, including future missions such as the Nancy Grace-Roman Space Telescope, for identifying periodic AGNs, but complementary tests are still needed to determine their physical origins such as SMBHBs.

  We report the discovery of a unique quasar-dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) system at $z = 5.63$, consisting of the bright quasar J1133+1603 ($M_{\rm UV} = -27.42$) and its compact, dust-obscured companion, J1133c. ALMA observations reveal a prominent [C II] bridge connecting the quasar and DSFG, indicating ongoing interaction at a projected separation of 1.8 arcsec ($\sim$10 proper kpc). J1133c exhibits unusually bright and broad [C II] emission ($L_{\rm [CII]} &gt; 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, FWHM $&gt; 500$ km s$^{-1}$), with a [C II] luminosity five times that of the quasar, suggesting intense star formation or potential AGN activity. The inferred star formation rate from [C II] is approximately $10^3$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The remarkable properties of this pair strongly suggest that galaxy interactions may simultaneously trigger both starburst and quasar activity, driving rapid evolution in the early universe.

  Context. A series of studies have demonstrated that the Gaia multipeak method (GMP) is a very efficient technique to select active galactic nucleus (AGN) pair candidates. The number of candidates is determined by the size of the input AGN catalogs, usually limited to spectroscopically-confirmed objects. Aims. The objective of this work is to compile a larger and highly reliable catalog of GMP pair candidates extracted from the six million objects the Gaia AGN catalog, the majority of which lack spectroscopic information. Methods. In order to ascertain the differences in the properties of GMP pair candidates compared to normal AGN, we conducted an investigation utilising samples of GMP AGN. These differences were employed to establish the optimal selecting criteria, which ultimately led to the identification of a highly reliable candidate catalog. Results. We found significant differences in astrometry and multi-band colour distribution between normal AGN and GMP pair candidates. A DUal and Lensed AGN candidate catalog with GMP method (DULAG) comprising 5,286 sources was ultimately compiled, accompanied by a highly reliable Golden sample of 1,867 sources. A total of 37 sources in the Golden sample have been identified as dual AGN or lensed AGN. For the majority of sources in the Golden sample, we provide reference redshifts and find three close AGN pair candidates among them.
