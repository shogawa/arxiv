  This study presents the black hole accretion history (BHAH) of obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) identified from the JWST CEERS survey by Chien et al. (2024) using mid-infrared (MIR) SED fitting. We compute black hole accretion rates (BHARs) to estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD), $\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$, across $0 &lt; z &lt; 4.25$. MIR luminosity functions (LFs) are also constructed for these sources, modeled with modified Schechter and double power law forms, and corresponding BHAD, $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$, is derived by integrating the LFs and multiplying by the luminosity. Both $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extend to luminosities as low as $10^7 \, L_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude fainter than pre-JWST studies. Our results show that BHAD peaks between redshifts 1 and 3, with the peak varying by method and model, $z \approx 1$--2 for $\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$ and the double power law, and $z \approx 2$--3 for the modified Schechter function. A scenario where AGN activity peaks before cosmic star formation would challenge existing black hole formation theories, but our present study, based on early JWST observations, provides an initial exploration of this possibility. At $z \sim 3$, $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ appears higher than X-ray estimates, suggesting that MIR observations are more effective in detecting obscured AGNs missed by X-ray observations. However, given the overlapping error bars, this difference remains within the uncertainties and requires confirmation with larger samples. These findings highlight the potential of JWST surveys to enhance the understanding of co-evolution between galaxies and AGNs.

  Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) are crucial for cosmological studies, particularly in understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and the role of dark energy. ELGs form an essential component of the target catalogue for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a major astronomical survey. However, the accurate selection of ELGs for such surveys is challenging due to the inherent uncertainties in determining their redshifts with photometric data. In order to improve the accuracy of photometric redshift estimation for ELGs, we propose a novel approach CNN-MLP that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). This approach integrates both images and photometric data derived from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10. By leveraging the complementary strengths of CNNs (for image data processing) and MLPs (for photometric feature integration), the CNN-MLP model achieves a $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ (normalised median absolute deviation) of 0.0140 and an outlier fraction of 2.57%. Compared to other models, CNN-MLP demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy of ELG photometric redshift estimation, which directly benefits the target selection process for DESI. In addition, we explore the photometric redshifts of different galaxy types (Starforming, Starburst, AGN, Broadline). Furthermore, this approach will contribute to more reliable photometric redshift estimation in ongoing and future large-scale sky surveys (e.g. LSST, CSST, Euclid), enhancing the overall efficiency of cosmological research and galaxy surveys.

  Several models of nuclear dust in active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been presented in the literature to determine its physical and geometrical properties, usually assuming the dust density distribution as the main aspect producing differences in the mid-infrared (MIR) emission of AGNs. We present a study of the MIR emission of nearby AGNs by exploring the effects of dust distribution and chemical composition on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using radiative transfer simulations. Our model grid includes smooth, clumpy, and two-phase dust distributions, combined with two dust compositions: the interstellar medium (ISM) dust composition including large grains (up to $\rm{10 \ \mu m}$), and the oxide/silicate-based composition from Reyes-Amador et al. (2024). A synthetic SED library was generated and analysed both on a model-to-model basis and with observed MIR spectra from 68 AGNs. We found that dust density distribution and dust composition significantly influence the spectral shapes and silicate features at $10$ and $\rm{18 \ \mu m}$, especially at edge-on orientations. The smooth distribution produces stronger and broader silicate absorption features, while the clumpy distribution generates stronger features in emission. The two-phase distributions exhibit intermediate characteristics depending on the clumpiness fraction ($f_{\text{cl}}$) and filling factor ($f_{\text{fill}}$). The ISM dust composition with large grains is more suited to reproduce the observed features and a higher fraction of good fits, particularly with Type-2 SEDs, independently of dust density distributions. The Reyes-Amador et al. (2024) composition provides a larger number of good fits with Type-1 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \leq 0.5$, and with Type-2 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \geq 0.9$. This work shows that no single dust distribution or composition reproduces all observations.

  Bars are considered an efficient mechanism for transporting gas toward the central regions of galaxies, potentially enhancing nuclear activity. However, the extent to which bars influence active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and whether their efficiency varies with environment, remain open questions. In this study, we aim to quantify the role of bars in triggering AGNs by comparing the AGN fraction in barred and non-barred galaxies across different environments. We constructed a sample from the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS catalog, ensuring a control selection where both samples share similar distributions in stellar mass, redshift, magnitude, concentration index, and local density parameter. AGNs were identified using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, yielding 1330 barred AGNs and 1651 unbarred AGNs. We use the [OIII]5007 luminosity (Lum[OIII]) and the accretion rate parameter R as indicators of nuclear activity. Based on these, we applied criteria to distinguish powerful from weak AGNs, allowing a more precise assessment of the bar's impact on the supermassive black hole. Our analysis reveals that barred galaxies tend to host a higher fraction of powerful AGNs. From Lum[OIII], we find that more active nuclei reside in massive, blue galaxies with young stellar populations. We also observe a slight tendency for barred galaxies to host less massive black holes accreting more efficiently. The classification of strong and weak bars shows that more prominent bars correlate with higher nuclear activity. While this trend shows no significant differences in intermediate-density environments, it becomes evident in both low- and high-density regions, where galaxies with strong bars show enhanced AGN activity.

  We investigate the evolution of black holes on orbits with small inclinations ($i &lt; 2^\circ$) to the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei. We perform 3D adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations within a shearing frame, studying the damping of inclination by black hole-gas gravitation. We find that for objects with $i&lt;3H_0R_0^{-1}$, where $H_0R_0^{-1}$ is the disc aspect ratio, the inclination lost per midplane crossing is proportional to the inclination preceding the crossing, resulting in a net exponential decay in inclination. For objects with $i&gt;3H_0R_0^{-1}$, damping efficiency decreases for higher inclinations. We consider a variety of different AGN environments, finding that damping is stronger for systems with a higher ambient Hill mass: the initial gas mass within the BH sphere-of-influence. We provide a fitting formula for the inclination changes as a function of Hill mass. We find reasonable agreement between the damping driven by gas gravity in the simulations and the damping driven by accretion under a Hill-limited Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton prescription. We find that gas dynamical friction consistently overestimates the strength of damping, especially for lower inclination systems, by at least an order of magnitude. For regions in the AGN disc where coplanar binary black hole formation by gas dissipation is efficient, we find that the simulated damping timescales are especially short with $\tau_d &lt; 10P_\mathrm{SMBH}$. We conclude that as the timescales for inclination damping are shorter than the expected interaction time between isolated black holes, the vast majority of binaries formed from gas capture should form from components with negligible inclination to the AGN disc.

  Accretion onto supermassive black holes (BHs) can launch relativistic jets that inject energy and momentum into their surroundings. Understanding how such feedback shapes large-scale accretion is key to bridging observations from galactic scales (e.g., the Bondi radius, $r_{\rm B}$) down to event horizon scales ($r_{\rm g}$), spanning 5-6 orders of magnitude. We tackle this challenge by varying the spatial scale separation across 2-4 orders of magnitude and performing some of the longest contiguous 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to date ($t \lesssim 4\times10^6 r_{\rm g}/c$), of Bondi-like accretion of rotating, non-relativistic gas with weak vertical magnetic fields onto a rapidly spinning BH, achieving inflow equilibrium out to $r \gtrsim 10^3 r_{\rm g}$. We find that, regardless of scale separation or ambient gas rotation, all simulations reach a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the BH becomes magnetically saturated. In this state, the mass inflow rate follows a universal radial scaling: $\dot{M}_{\rm in}(r) \sim r^s$ with $s = 0.66 \pm 0.03$. The MAD state self-regulates through jets, outflows, and magnetic flux eruptions that can disrupt coherent angular momentum inflow, giving rise to a rocking accretion disk (RAD) state. This RAD state features chaotically oriented inflows, weak intermittent jets, and a steeper inflow slope of $s = 0.87 \pm 0.05$. The MAD and RAD BH accretion rates become comparable at typical scale separations, $r_{\rm B}/ r_{\rm g} \gtrsim 10^5$. Weaker RAD outflows allow large-scale inflows to resume, restoring the MAD state and enabling a recurring MAD-RAD cycle. These cycles can last tens of Bondi timescales, $t_{\rm B} \sim 0.2\,\text{Myr} \times (r_{\rm B}/10^{5} r_{\rm g})^{3/2} \times (M_{\rm BH}/10^9M_\odot)$, potentially setting the duty cycle of jetted AGN outbursts, such as in M87*.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consist of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) embedded in a region with both high gas and stellar densities: the gas is present as a thin accretion disc that fuels the central SMBH, while the stars form a dense, roughly isotropic nuclear star cluster. The binaries present in such a cluster could be considered naturally as triples, with the SMBH as a third object, and their dynamics also depend on the interaction with the gas-rich disc. In this paper, we study the evolution of such a binary on an inclined orbit with respect to the disc. The binary experiences both eccentricity excitation via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and drag forces from each time it penetrates the disc. We find that, as the outer orbital inclination decreases, the evolution of inner orbital separation can transition from a regime of gradual hardening to a regime of rapid softening. As such binaries grow wider, their minimum pericentre distances (during ZLK oscillations) decrease. We show that a simple geometric condition, modulated by the complex ZLK evolution, dictates whether a binary expands or contracts due to the interactions with the AGN disc. Our results suggest that the interaction with gas-rich accretion disc could enhance the rate of stellar mergers and formation of gravitational wave sources, as well as other transients. The treatment introduced here is general and could apply, with the proper modifications, to hierarchical triples in other gas-rich systems.

  Intensive reverberation mapping monitoring programs combine ground-based photometric observations from different telescopes, requiring intercalibration of lightcurves to reduce systematic instrumental differences. We present a new iterative algorithm to calibrate photometric time-series data of active galactic nuclei (AGN) using 100s of comparison stars on the same images, building upon the established method of ensemble photometry. The algorithm determines telescope-specific and epoch-specific correction parameters, and simultaneously computes a multi-component noise model to account for underestimated uncertainties based on the scatter in the comparison star data, effectively identifying problematic epochs, telescopes, and stars. No assumptions need to be made about the AGN variability shape, and the algorithm can in principle be applied to any astronomical object. We demonstrate our method on lightcurves taken with ten 1-m telescopes from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) robotic telescope network. Comparing our results to other intercalibration tools, we find that the algorithm can more accurately quantify the uncertainties in the data. We describe additional corrections that can be made for particularly bluer AGNs like Fairall 9, arising due to systematic effects dependent on star colour.

  Absorption outflows in quasars play an important role in understanding active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and their influence on galaxy evolution. The unprecedented spectral data provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) opens new avenues to explore these outflows. We analyze five low-ionization absorption outflow systems in four intermediate-redshift quasars ($2 &lt; z &lt; 3$) using the data obtained by DESI in order to characterize their physical properties and energetics, and also to assess their role in AGN feedback. We use the spectra from DESI's Early Data Release to determine the ionic column densities, total hydrogen column densities, electron number densities, and ionization parameters via photoionization modeling and absorption line analysis. We derive the outflows' distance from the AGN, and its kinematic properties: mass-flow rates, kinetic luminosity, and momentum flux. Our study identifies five distinct mini-broad absorption line outflow systems, hosted by four quasars. The identified outflows exhibit hydrogen column densities of $\log (N_H) = 20.0-20.7$[cm$^{-2}$], ionization parameters of $\log (U_H) = -2.7$ to $-2.1$, and electron number densities of $\log (n_e) =1.45-2.85$[cm$^{-2}$]. The distances of the outflows from the central source are between 4.5 to 31 kpc, and the kinetic luminosities range from $2\times10^{-6}$ to $5\times10^{-3}$ of the Eddington luminosity. The outflows in J1407 and J1032 show the largest kinetic luminosities, with momentum flux ratios ($\dot{p} / \dot{p}_{rad}$) of about 2 and 0.2, respectively. Our findings highlight the vital role of DESI data in uncovering the diversity and significance of quasar outflows in galaxy evolution.
