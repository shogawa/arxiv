We study the spatially resolved star formation, gas ionisation, and outflow properties of 1813 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the MaNGA survey, which we classify into infrared (IR), broad-line (BL), narrow-line (NL), and radio (RD) AGNs based on their mid-infrared colours, optical spectra, and/or radio photometry. We also provide estimations of AGN power at different wavelengths. AGN incidence is found to increase with stellar mass following a power-law, with the high-mass end dominated by RDAGNs and the low-mass end dominated by NLAGNs. Compared to their mass-matched non-AGN counterparts, we find that IRAGNs, BLAGNs, and NLAGNs on average show enhanced specific star formation rates, younger stellar populations, and harder ionisation towards the centre. RDAGNs, in contrast, show radial profiles similar to quiescent galaxies. [OIII] outflows are more common and stronger in BL/IRAGNs, while RDAGNs on average show no outflow features. The outflow incidence increases with [OIII] luminosity, and the features in BL/IRAGNs on average extend to ~2 kpc from the nuclei. We further discuss a possible evolutionary sequence of AGNs and their host galaxies, where AGNs with strong emission lines or dust tori are present in star-forming galaxies. Later, young compact radio jets emerge, the host galaxies gradually quench, and the AGN hosts eventually evolve into globally quiescent systems with larger radio jets that prevent further gas cooling.

Polarization is one of the fundamental natures of electromagnetic radiation. The detection of polarization or polarized photons from distant X-ray radiating systems (such as X-ray binaries (XBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and stars) complements the timing, spectral, and imagining analysis to better understand the physical mechanisms taking place in these sources. Polarization has enhanced the understanding of the internal geometry of these systems and their vicinity. Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field. In this chapter, we have discussed (i) the basic idea of polarization, (ii) some distant sources radiating polarized X-ray photons, (iii) missions dedicated to observing polarized X-ray photons, and (iv) recent breakthroughs and upcoming missions.

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide energetic feedback necessary to `turn off' star formation in high-mass galaxies (M$_{\rm halo} \geq $ 10$^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, $10.4 \leq \log(\frac{M_*}{M_\odot}) \leq 11$) as observed. Cosmic rays (CRs) have been proposed as a promising channel of AGN feedback, but the nature of CR feedback from AGN remains uncertain. We analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of massive galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-3) project including multi-channel AGN feedback, explicitly evolving kinetic/mechanical, radiative, and spectrally-resolved CRs from the central black hole. Specifically, we explore different CR feedback and transport assumptions, calibrated to Milky Way local ISM constraints, and compare them to observed galaxy scaling relations. We find that all parameterizations explored self-regulate within agreement with observed galaxy scaling relations, demonstrating that CR injection efficiencies varied by $\sim$1.5 dex and locally-variable transport produce quenched galaxies with reasonable bulk properties; however, they feature orders-of-magnitude variant circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas properties. Our results indicate that multi-wavelength synthetic observations probing these varied halo properties from larger simulated samples in conjunction with observational comparisons may place novel constraints on how AGN physically quench star formation in massive galaxies.

Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently discovered by JWST, show distinctive Balmer-transition features, including prominent Balmer absorption, pronounced Balmer breaks, and large equivalent widths of broad $\mathrm{H}α$ emission, all of which indicate the presence of dense gas surrounding their central black holes. A further key property of LRDs is their large Balmer decrements with broad $\mathrm{H}α/\mathrm{H}β$ line-flux ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. These ratios of $\mathrm{H}α/\mathrm{H}β&gt;3$ have often been interpreted as evidence for heavy dust extinction ($A_V\gtrsim 3$ mag), however such dust would inevitably produce strong near-to-mid infrared re-emission that is hardly seen in JWST/MIRI observations. To investigate the physical origin of these observed Balmer features, we perform radiation transfer calculations through dust-free, dense gas. We show that the observed large Balmer decrements ($\mathrm{H}α/\mathrm{H}β$ and $\mathrm{H}α/\mathrm{H}γ$) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities ($n_\mathrm{H} \gtrsim 10^{{8}-{10}}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of $\sim O(10~M_\odot)$. Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei.

We present new JWST IFS observations of the active galaxy NGC 1068, combining Mid-IR and optical IFS data from MIRI and MUSE to characterize the multi-phase circumnuclear gas properties and its interaction with the AGN outflow and radio jet. MIRI data trace the multiphase gas emission up to 400 pc from the nucleus at 20--60 pc resolution, unveiling a clumpy ionized structure around the radio hot-spots and a rotating warm molecular disc. Innovative Mid-IR diagnostic diagrams highlight the role of the AGN as the main excitation source for the ionized gas in the entire MIRI field of view, consistent with optical diagnostics, and supporting the AGN-driven wind scenario. Density sensitive [NeV] and [ArV] Mid-IR transitions reveal high-density clumps (n_e &gt; 10**4 cm**-3) along the edges of the jet and outflow, tracing gas compression by the expanding wind. We combined multi-cloud kinematic (MOKA) and photo-ionization (HOMERUN) modeling to characterize the ionized outflow properties and found that [OIV] traces an outflow 300 km/s faster than that inferred from [OIII], showing that the two lines originate from distinct gas components. This kinematic dichotomy is confirmed by the photoionization analysis, which requires a dust-poor component dominating the optical lines and a dust-rich component responsible for the Mid-IR emission. The Mid-IR-revealed dusty component carries a significantly larger ionized-gas mass than what can be inferred from optical lines alone, showing that most of the outflowing mass is hidden from classical optical diagnostics. Our modelling point to a two-stage acceleration scenario, with velocities up to ~2000 km/s, consistent with an energy-driven wind. Our findings indicates that the outflow entrains up to a few 10**6 solar masses of ionized gas and couples efficiently with the surrounding ISM, injecting turbulence and impacting the host-galaxy environment.

We quantify departures from hydrodynamical and centrifugal equilibrium in the gas discs of low-mass ($10^{10.75}&lt;M_\mathrm{200c}/\mathrm{M}_\odot&lt;10^{11}$) galaxies from the COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We evaluate the full Eulerian acceleration balance in the midplane and show that disequilibrium is widespread: equilibrium-based circular velocity estimates typically have errors of $\geq 10$ per cent ($\approx 75$ per cent of midplane gas by mass). Disequilibrium is strongest and the largest associated errors occur in the inner few kiloparsecs that are crucial for constraining the dark matter density profile. Correcting the circular velocity to account for pressure and convective terms does not reliably improve its recovery in strongly perturbed systems where time-dependent forces dominate the residual acceleration budget. Stellar feedback, self-gravitating gas clumps and AGN energy injection account for most strong local perturbations, and large-scale gravitational asymmetries act as a scaffold for disequilibrium. We classify gas discs into coherent, perturbed, and slow/erratic rotators and show that this classification correlates with galaxy properties like mass, morphology and tracers of recent feedback. A majority of galaxies in our sample would be unsuitable for standard rotation curve analysis. Much of the observed diversity in the shapes of dwarf galaxy rotation curves may stem from non-equilibrium gas motions rather than diversity in mass profiles - resolving the discrepancy is then first and foremost a problem in gas dynamics.

Stellar and AGN-driven feedback processes affect the distribution of gas on a wide range of scales, from within galaxies well into the intergalactic medium. Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\rm 200c} &lt; 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution.
