  Cold, substellar objects such as brown dwarfs have long been recognized as contaminants in color-selected samples of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In particular, their near- to mid-infrared colors (1--5 $\mu$m) can closely resemble the V-shaped ($f_{\lambda}$) spectra of highly-reddened accreting supermassive black holes, the little red dots, especially at $6 &lt; z &lt; 7$. Recently, a NIRCam-selected sample of little red dots over 45 arcmin$^2$ has been followed-up with deep NIRSpec multi-object prism spectroscopy through the UNCOVER program. By investigating the acquired spectra, we identify three out of the 13 followed-up objects as brown dwarfs with temperatures between 650 and 1300 K and distances between 0.8 and 4.8 kpc. We identify the remaining 10 objects as extragalactic sources at $z_{\rm spec} &gt; 3$. Given that three of these sources are the strongly lensed images of the same AGN (Abell2744-QSO1), we derive a brown dwarf contamination fraction of 27\% in this NIRCam-selection of little red dots. We find that in the near-infrared filters, brown dwarfs appear much bluer than the highly-reddened AGN, providing an avenue for distinguishing the two and compiling cleaner samples of photometrically-selected highly-reddened AGN.

  The dominant source of radio continuum emissions at low frequencies is synchrotron radiation, which originates from star-forming regions in disk galaxies and from powerful jets produced by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We studied the Bootes field using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 400 MHz, achieving a central minimum off-source RMS noise of 35$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and a catalogue of 3782 sources in $\sim6$ sq. degrees of the sky. The resulting catalogue was compared to other radio frequency catalogues, and the corrected normalised differential source counts were derived. We use standard multi-wavelength techniques to classify the sources in star-forming galaxies (SFGs), radio-loud (RL) AGN, and radio-quiet (RQ) AGN that confirm a boost in the SFGs and RQ\,AGN AGN populations at lower flux levels. For the first time, we investigated the properties of the radio--IR relations at 400\,MHz in this field. The $L_{\rm 400 MHz}$--$L_{\rm TIR}$ relations for SFGs were found to show a strong correlation with non-linear slope values of $1.10\pm0.01$, and variation of $q_{\rm TIR}$ with $z$ is given as, $q_{\rm TIR} = (2.19 \pm 0.07)\ (1+z)^{-0.15 \pm 0.08}$. This indicates that the non-linearity of the radio--IR relations can be attributed to the mild variation of $q_{\rm TIR}$ values with $z$. The derived relationships exhibit similar behaviour when applied to LOFAR at 150 MHz and also at 1.4 GHz. This emphasises the fact that other parameters like magnetic field evolution with $z$ or the number densities of cosmic ray electrons can play a vital role in the mild evolution of $q$ values.

  In several jetted AGNs, structured jets have been observed. In particular spine-sheath configurations where the jet is radially divided into two or more zones of different flow velocities. We present a model based on the particle and radiation transport code CR-ENTREES. Here, interaction rates and secondary particle and photon yields are pre-calculated by Monte Carlo event generators or semi-analytical approximations. These are then used to create transition matrices, that describe how each particle spectrum evolves with time. This code allows for arbitrary injection of primary particles, and the possibility to choose which interaction to include (photo-meson production, Bethe-Heitler pair-production, inverse-Compton scattering, $\gamma$-$\gamma$ pair production, decay of all unstable particles, synchrotron radiation -- from electrons, protons, and all relevant secondaries before their respective decays -- and particle escape). In addition to the particle and radiation interactions taking place in each homogeneous zone, we implement the feedback between the two zones having different bulk velocities. The main mechanism at play when particles cross the boundary between the two zones is shear acceleration. We follow a microscopic description of this acceleration process to create a corresponding transition matrix and include it in our numerical setup. Furthermore, each zone's radiation field can be used as an external target photon field for the other zone's particle interactions. We present here the first results of the effect of a two-zone spine-sheath jet, by applying this model to typical low-luminosity AGNs.

  Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) collaboration presents the first catalog of $\gamma$-ray sources using 508 days LHAASO data from March 2021 to September 2022. This catalog contains five active galactic nuclei (AGNs), of which four are blazars and one is a liner-type AGN. In this work, we establish averaged multi-wavelength SEDs by combining data from $Fermi$-Large Area Telescope, $Swift$, $ZTF$, and $WISE$ with the same period as the LHAASO detection. In general, these five AGNs are found in low states at all wavelengths. To study the multi-wavelength properties of these AGNs, several jet emission models, including the one-zone leptonic model, the one-zone leptonic and hadronuclear ($pp$) model, the one-zone proton-synchrotron model, and the spine-layer model are applied to reproduce their averaged SEDs, respectively. We find that the one-zone leptonic model can reproduce most of the SEDs, except for the high-energy tail of LHAASO spectra. To improve the fitting, emission from $pp$ interactions is favoured in the framework of one-zone model. The spine-layer model, which can be treated as a multi-zone scenario, also can provide good spectra fits. The influence of different extragalactic background light models on fitting LHAASO energy spectrum is also discussed.

  The multiwavelength data of nuclear transient AT2018dyk, initially discovered as a changing-look low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy, has been revisited by us and found being in agreement with a tidal disruption event (TDE) scenario. The optical light curve of AT2018dyk declines as a power-law form approximately with index -5/3 yet its X-ray emission lags behind the optical peak by $\sim140$ days, both of which are typical characteristics for TDEs. The X-ray spectra are softer than normal active galactic nuclei (AGNs) although they show a slight trend of hardening. Interestingly, its rising time scale belongs to the longest among TDEs while it is nicely consistent with the theoretical prediction from its relatively large supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($\sim10^{7.38} M_{\odot}$). Moreover, a prominent infrared echo with peak luminosity $\sim7.4\times10^{42}~\text{erg}~\text{s}^{-1}$ has been also detected in AT2018dyk, implying an unusually dusty subparsec nuclear environment in contrast with other TDEs. In our sample, LINERs share similar covering factors with AGNs, which indicates the existence of the dusty torus in these objects. Our work suggests that the nature of nuclear transients in LINERs needs to be carefully identified and their infrared echoes offer us a unique opportunity for exploring the environment of SMBHs at low accretion rate, which has been so far poorly explored but is crucial for understanding the SMBH activity.

  The Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) program observed the Extended Groth Strip with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2022. In this paper, we discuss the four MIRI pointings that observed with longer wavelength filters, including F770W, F1000W, F1280W, F1500W, F1800W, and F2100W. We compare the MIRI galaxies with the Spitzer/MIPS 24$\mu$m population in the EGS field. We find that MIRI can observe an order of magnitude deeper than MIPS in significantly shorter integration times, attributable to JWST's much larger aperture and MIRI's improved sensitivity. MIRI is exceptionally good at finding faint ($L_{\rm IR}&lt;10^{10} L_\odot$) galaxies at $z\sim1-2$. We find that a significant portion of MIRI galaxies are "mid-IR weak"--they have strong near-IR emission and relatively weaker mid-IR emission, and most of the star formation is unobscured. We present new IR templates that capture how the mid-IR to near-IR emission changes with increasing infrared luminosity. We present two color-color diagrams to separate mid-IR weak galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) from dusty star-forming galaxies and find that these color diagrams are most effective when used in conjunction with each other. We present the first number counts of 10$\mu$m sources and find that there are $\lesssim10$ IR AGN per MIRI pointing, possibly due to the difficulty of distinguishing AGN from intrinsically mid-IR weak galaxies (due to low metallicities or low dust content). We conclude that MIRI is most effective at observing moderate luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}=10^9-10^{10}L_\odot$) galaxies at $z=1-2$, and that photometry alone is not effective at identifying AGN within this faint population.

  Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from X-ray to far-infrared (FIR) wavelengths are presented for a sample of 1246 X-ray luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN; $L_{0.5-10\rm{keV}}&gt;10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$), with $z_{\rm{spec}}&lt;1.2$, selected from Stripe 82X, COSMOS, and GOODS-N/S. The rest-frame SEDs show a wide spread ($\sim2.5$ dex) in the relative strengths of broad continuum features at X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), mid-infrared (MIR), and FIR wavelengths. A linear correlation (log-log slope of 0.7$\pm0.04$) is found between $L_{\rm{MIR}}$ and $L_{\rm{X}}$. There is significant scatter in the relation between the $L_{\rm{UV}}$ and $L_{\rm{X}}$ due to heavy obscuration, however the most luminous and unobscured AGN show a linear correlation (log-log slope of 0.8$\pm0.06$) in the relation above this scatter. The relation between $L_{\rm{FIR}}$ and $L_{\rm{X}}$ is predominantly flat, but with decreasing dispersion at $L_{\rm{X}}&gt;10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The ratio between the "galaxy subtracted" bolometric luminosity and the intrinsic $L_{\rm{X}}$ increases from a factor of $\sim$$10-70$ from log $L_{\rm{bol}}/{\rm(erg\; s}^{-1})=44.5-46.5$. Characteristic SED shapes have been determined by grouping AGN based on relative strengths of the UV and MIR emission. The average $L_{1\mu\rm{m}}$ is constant for the majority of these SED shapes, while AGN with the strongest UV and MIR emission have elevated $L_{1\mu\rm{m}}$, consistent with the AGN emission dominating their SEDs at optical and NIR wavelengths. A strong correlation is found between the SED shape and both the $L_{\rm{X}}$ and $L_{\rm{bol}}$, such that $L_{\rm{bol}}/L_{\rm{X}}=20.4\pm1.8$, independent of the SED shape. This is consistent with an evolutionary scenario of increasing $L_{\rm{bol}}$ with decreasing obscuration as the AGN blows away circumnuclear gas.
