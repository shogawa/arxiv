  Strong both broad and narrow emission lines from central broad emission line regions (BLRs) and narrow emission line regions (NLRs) are fundamental spectroscopic characteristics of broad line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs). Lack of central BLRs leads to the identified true Type-2 AGNs without central hidden BLRs, providing clues on formation/suppression of AGN BLRs. Whether were there BLAGNs with lack of central NLRs is still an open question. Here, in the blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613, both blue continuum emissions and broad emission lines can be clearly detected in its SDSS spectrum, however there are no apparently detected narrow emission lines in the optical/NUV bands, leading to no central normal NLRs in the blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613. In order to explain the lack of NLRs, evolving NLRs is proposed that the radial outflows are carrying materials from BLRs to NLRs and the current narrow line emission materials are lying closer to the outer side of central BLRs in SDSS J1521+0613. The results in this manuscript can indicate a new unique subclass of BLAGNs, the BLAGNs without central normal NLRs, which will provide potential clues on physical origin/evolution of AGN NLRs.

  We present initial results from the 4.8 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Field (TDF). From 106 radio sources found in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations in the TDF, we detected 12 sources (11% detection rate) at 3.3 $\mu$Jy rms sensitivity and 4 mas resolution. Most detections exhibit pc-scale emission (less than 40 pc) with high VLBA/VLA flux density ratios and brightness temperatures exceeding 10$^5$ K, confirming non-thermal AGN activity. Spectral indices ($&gt;$ -0.5) correlate with higher VLBA/VLA flux ratios, consistent with synchrotron emission from AGN coronae or jets. In the majority of our sources star formation contributes less than 50% of the total VLBA radio emission, with a few cases where the emission is almost entirely AGN-driven. Although the radio emission from radio quiet AGN is thought to be primarily driven by star formation, our VLBA observations confirm that there is also often a contribution at various levels from black hole driven AGN. Eight VLBA detections have JWST/NIRCam counterparts, predominantly early-type, bulge-dominated galaxies, which we use to get an estimate of the redshift and star formation rate (SFR). WISE colors indicate that VLBA detections are either AGN or intermediate-disk-dominated systems, while VLBA non-detections correspond to extended, star-forming galaxies. We compare SFRs derived from previous SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m observations with new JWST-based estimates, and discuss the observed discrepancies, highlighting JWST's improved capability to disentangle AGN activity from star formation.

  Astrometry with the very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) allows us to determine the position of a point close to the brightest compact detail of the source at milliarcsecond scales. For most active galactic nuclei (AGNs), this compact detail is the opaque core of the radio jet. Rare cases of sources whose brightest detail is not the core but a prominent jet feature parsecs away from the core have been reported, but such sources remained elusive. In this work, we use a novel method for a systematic search of these sources. We scrutinize the AGNs for which the offset between their coordinates determined with VLBI and Gaia is statistically significant and coincides with the vector between two dominant features in their VLBI images, using publicly available archival multi-frequency data. We find 35 sources whose VLBI coordinates are associated with a bright component of their jet separated by several to tens of mas from the radio core. Their Gaia coordinates, in turn, correspond to the jet origin and are close to the radio jet core. The previously published jet directions of most of them must be reversed. These sources exhibit atypically low brightness temperatures of the radio cores, down to 10^9 K in the host galaxy frame, and, at the same time, extreme brightness of the dominating jet components. We argue that these bright components are standing shock fronts and discuss possible physical reasons for the low core brightness, such as ineffective particle heating, atypical absorption, or differential Doppler boosting.

  [Abridged] We present a multi-line study of the kinematics of the molecular and ionised gas phases in the central 2 kpc of NGC6240, based on JWST/NIRSpec and ALMA observations. We devised a new spectral-line fitting approach to de-blend rotating and non-rotating gas components, which is better tailored to the extreme feedback mechanisms at work in NGC6240. We find that ~65% of the Pa$\alpha$, H$_2$, and [FeII] line fluxes within the NIRSpec field of view arise from gas components that are kinematically decoupled from the stars. The NIR H$_2$ lines show the most deviation from the stars, with peak emission between the two rotating stellar structures. The PAH 3.3$\mu$m feature does not follow the NIR H$_2$ morphology, indicating that the latter does not trace PDRs. In the non-rotating gas components, we identify a biconical wind launched from the northern AGN, expanding along the minor axis of stellar rotation. This wind is dominated by ionised gas and, although it entrains some H$_2$, it does not show a H$_2$/PAH enhancement, suggesting either high UV irradiation or expansion along a relatively gas-free path. Furthermore, we find bright non-rotating gas emission between the two AGN and around the southern AGN, which we interpret as due to an outflow launched from the southern nucleus, coinciding with the molecular outflow previously studied in cold (sub-)millimeter tracers. The strong H$_2$/PAH enhancement measured in this region, coextensive with high velocity redshifted gas ($v\sim900$ km s$^{-1}$), suggests that the shocks responsible for the high H$_2$/PAH ratios are due to the outflow rather than to the collision of media during the merger. Our results show that the bulk of the NIR line emission in NGC6240 is decoupled from the stars, and that most of the warm H$_2$ is shock-excited and embedded in a powerful outflow, where it coexists with colder molecular gas.

  Little is currently known about the physical properties of the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding massive galaxies. Next-generation X-ray observatories will enable detailed studies of the hot CGM in emission. To support these future efforts, we make predictions of the X-ray emission from the hot CGM using a sample of 28 $\sim$Milky Way-mass disk galaxies at $z=0$ from seven cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites incorporating a wide range of galactic feedback prescriptions. The X-ray surface brightness (XSB) morphology of the hot CGM varies significantly across simulations. XSB-enhanced outflows and bubble-like structures are predicted in many galaxies simulated with AGN feedback and in some stellar-feedback-only galaxies, while other galaxies exhibit more isotropic XSB distributions at varying brightnesses. Galaxies simulated without cosmic ray physics exhibit radial XSB profiles with similar shapes ($\propto r^{-3}$ within $20-200$ kpc), with scatter about this slope likely due to underlying feedback physics. The hot CGM kinematics also differ substantially: velocity maps reveal signatures of bulk CGM rotation and high-velocity biconical outflows, particularly in simulations incorporating AGN feedback. Some stellar-feedback-only models also generate similar AGN-like outflows, which we postulate is due to centrally-concentrated star formation. Simulations featuring AGN feedback frequently produce extended temperature enhancements in large-scale galactic outflows, while simulations incorporating cosmic ray physics predict the coolest CGM due to pressure support being provided by cosmic rays rather than hot CGM. Individually-resolved X-ray emission lines further distinguish hot CGM phases, with lower-energy lines (e.g., O VII) largely tracing volume-filling gas, and higher-energy lines (e.g., Fe XVII) highlighting high-velocity feedback-driven outflows.   

Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of
  reverberation-mapped H$β$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line

  We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.
