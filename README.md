  We present new Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 G141 grism observations for COBRA1411+3415, originally identified as a high-redshift cluster candidate in the Clusters Occupied by Bent Radio AGN (COBRA) survey using radio, infrared, and optical data. We spectroscopically identify seven cluster members within a 0.5 Mpc radius with grism redshifts in the range $1.8006 \leq z_{grism} \leq 1.8175$, consistent with COBRA1411+3415 being a high-redshift cluster with a mean redshift of $\langle z_{grism}\rangle = 1.8106 \pm 0.0006$. The detection of seven galaxies within this small redshift range is significant above the background distribution of galaxies at the level of 5$\sigma$. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the cluster is found to be $\sigma_{\parallel} = 701^{+347}_{-138}$ km/s with a virial mass of $M_{200} \approx 2.2^{+3.3}_{-1.3}\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. However, the mass may be lower if the cluster is still in formation. In projected phase-space, we also identify two possible infalling members of COBRA1411+3415 and two additional structures at $z\sim 1.73$ and $z\sim 1.88$. The similar spatial distributions and small projected separation from the main cluster suggest they could be a part of the same large-scale filament and together may form a protocluster system that could eventually merge to form a single, massive cluster. COBRA1411+3415 is the highest redshift cluster to be spectroscopically confirmed using a bent, double-lobed radio source as a cluster tracer.

  This paper presents the first combined detections of CO$_2$, CO, XCN and water ices beyond the local Universe. We find gas-phase CO in addition to the solid phase CO. Our source, SSTXFLS J172458.3+591545, is a $z=0.494$ star-forming galaxy which also hosts a deeply obscured AGN. The profiles of its ice features are consistent with those of other Galactic and local galaxy sources and the implied ice mantle composition is similar to that of even more obscured sources. The ice features indicate the presence of a compact nucleus in our galaxy and allow us to place constraints on its density and temperature ($n&gt;10^5$cm$^{-3}$ and $T=20-90K$). We infer the visual extinction towards this nucleus to be $A_V\approx6-7$. An observed plot of $\tau_{Si}$ vs. $\tau_{CO2}/\tau_{Si}$ can be viewed as a probe for both the total dustiness of a system as well as the clumpiness of the dust along the line of sight. This paper highlights the potential of using {\sl JWST} MIRI spectra to study the dust composition and geometric distribution of sources beyond the local Universe.

  There is a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within AGN J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an electromagnetic counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multi-messenger astronomy.   

Evolution of Shock Structures and QPOs After Halting BHL Accretion onto

  One of the mechanisms responsible for disk formation around the black holes is Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion.The fact that BHL accretion can be interrupted by various astrophysical phenomena, such as stellar winds or astrophysical jets, makes it crucial to study the behavior of shock cones formed by BHL accretion around black holes once the accretion process is halted. Investigating the new plasma structures that emerge in these scenarios can provide insights into observational results. In this context, a new plasma structure forming around the Kerr black hole has been numerically modeled as a function of the black hole spin parameter and the asymptotic velocity of BHL accretion. The numerical analysis revealed that high spin (a/M=0.9) and supersonic flow ( M &gt; 1) are necessary conditions for low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) formation. On the other hand, the fundamental mode of the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) are found to be independent of both the black hole spin and asymptotic velocity and are instead governed by general relativistic effects. Additionally, the study demonstrated that for 3:2 and 2:1 resonance states to form, nonlinear couplings needs to be occurred when the black hole rotates rapidly. These couplings produce harmonic frequencies, providing an explanation for the observed quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) resonances in black hole binaries. These findings align with precession models and nonlinear resonance models, both of which play a crucial role in QPO generation. Finally, the LFQPOs and HFQPOs obtained from numerical simulations are consistent with the observed QPO frequencies in the microquasars GRS 1915+105 and XTE J1550-564, as well as in the AGN REJ1034+396, which harbors a supermassive black hole at its center.   

A remarkable Ruby: Absorption in dense gas, rather than evolved stars,
  drives the extreme Balmer break of a Little Red Dot at $z=3.5$

  The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as `little red dots' (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at $z=3.55$ with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high-redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (H$\alpha\ \rm FWHM\sim1500$km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size ($M_*\sim10^{10.5}\,M_\odot,\ r_{e}\sim40\,$pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H$\alpha$ absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.
