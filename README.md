  Cooling flows are common in galaxy clusters which have cool cores. The soft X-ray emission below 1 keV from the flows is mostly absorbed by cold dusty gas within the central cooling sites. Further evidence for this process is presented here through a more detailed analysis of the nearby Centaurus cluster and some additional clusters. Predictions of JWST near and mid-infrared spectra from cooling gas are presented. [NeVI] emission at 7.65 micron should be an important diagnostic of gas cooling between 6 and 1.5 times 10^5 K. The emerging overall picture of hidden cooling flows is explored. The efficiency of AGN feedback in reducing the total cooling rate in cool cores is shown to be above 50 percent for many clusters but is rarely above 90 per cent. The reduction is mostly in outer gas. Cooling dominates in elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups which have mass flow rates below about 15M/yr and in some massive clusters where rates can exceed 1000M/yr.

  Understanding the evolution of galaxies cannot exclude the important role played by the central supermassive black hole and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Simulations have strongly suggested the negative feedback of AGN Jet/wind/outflows on the ISM/CGM of a galaxy leading to the eventual decline of star formation. However, no "smoking gun" evidence exists so far where relics of feedback, observed in any band, are consistent with the time scale of a major decline in star formation, in any sample of galaxies. Relics of any AGN-driven outflows will be observed as a faint and fuzzy structure which may be difficult to characterise by automated algorithms but trained citizen scientists can possibly perform better through their intuitive vision with additional heterogeneous data available anywhere on the Internet. RAD@home, launched on 15th April 2013, is not only the first Indian Citizen Science Research (CSR) platform in astronomy but also the only CSR publishing discoveries using any Indian telescope. We briefly report 11 CSR discoveries collected over the last eleven years. While searching for such relics we have spotted cases of offset relic lobes from elliptical and spiral, episodic radio galaxies with overlapping lobes as the host galaxy is in motion, large diffuse spiral-shaped emission, cases of jet-galaxy interaction, kinks and burls on the jets, a collimated synchrotron thread etc. Such exotic sources push the boundaries of our understanding of classical Seyferts and radio galaxies with jets and the process of discovery prepares the next generation for science with the upgraded GMRT and Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO).

  AIMS: We studied fast variability of three selected AGNs, IRAS 13224-3809, 1H 0707-495 and Mrk 766, and the cataclysmic variable MV Lyr observed by XMM-Newton and Kepler spacecrafts, respectively. Our goal is to search for common origin of the variability and to test the so-called sandwich model where a geometrically thick corona is surrounding a geometrically thin disc. METHODS: We study substructures of the averaged flare profiles. The flare profile method identifies individual flares in the light curve, and averages them. Direct fitting of the profile substructures identify individual characteristic frequencies seen in standard power density spectra (PDS) as a break frequency or quasi-periodic oscillation. The credibility of flare profile substructures is demonstrated by comparison with autocorrelation function. RESULTS: We found that the flare profiles of AGNs are similar to that of the cataclysmic variable in the low state. We explain this as a consequence of a truncated inner disc in a sandwich model. The same scenario is also able to explain the presence of characteristic break frequencies in X-ray PDS, but not seen in optical. We also searched for substructures in the flare profile of IRAS 13224-3809. In addition to a permanently present main flare, we found transient side-lobe appearing before the main flare and only seen in a high flux period. This complex flare profile of this AGN suggests that an additional source of X-rays appears during the high flux period. We propose a scenario in which an accretion flow fluctuation enters the sandwich corona and propagates further to some very central part of the accretion disc.

  The extragalactic gamma-ray sky is dominated by relativistic jets aligned to the observer's line of sight, i.e., blazars. A few of their misaligned counterparts, e.g., radio galaxies, are also detected with the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) albeit in a small number ($\sim$50), indicating the crucial role played by the jet viewing angle in detecting gamma-ray emission from jets. These gamma-ray emitting misaligned active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide us with a unique opportunity to understand the high-energy emission production mechanisms from a different viewpoint than the more common blazars. With this goal in mind, we have systematically studied the radio morphology of gamma-ray emitting sources present in the fourth data release of the fourth catalog of Fermi-LAT detected gamma-ray sources to identify misaligned AGN. By utilizing the high-resolution and sensitive MHz and GHz frequency observations delivered by the Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low-Frequency Array Two-metre Sky Survey, Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, here we present a catalog of 149 gamma-ray detected misaligned AGN, thus $\sim$tripling the number of known objects of this class. Our sample includes a variety of radio morphologies, e.g., edge-darkened and edge-brightened, hybrids, wide-angle-tailed, bent jets, and giants. Since the gamma-ray emission is thought to be highly sensitive to the jet viewing angle, such an enlarged sample of gamma-ray detected misaligned radio sources will permit us to explore the origin of high-energy emission in relativistic jets and radio lobes and study AGN unification, in general.

  The inter-band lags among the optical broad-band continua of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been intensively explored over the past decade. However, the nature of the lags remains under debate. Here utilizing two distinct scenarios for AGN variability, i.e., the thermal fluctuation of accretion disk and the reprocessing of both the accretion disk and clouds in the broad line region, we show that, owing to the random nature of AGN variability, the inter-band lags of an individual AGN would vary from one campaign with a finite baseline to another. Specifically, the thermal fluctuation scenario implies larger variations in the lags than the reprocessing scenario. Moreover, the former predicts a positive correlation between the lag and variation amplitude, while the latter does not result in such a correlation. For both scenarios, averaging the lags of an individual AGN measured with repeated and non-overlapping campaigns would give rise to a stable lag, which is larger for a longer baseline and gets saturation for a sufficiently long baseline. However, obtaining the stable lag for an individual AGN is very time-consuming. Alternatively, it can be equivalently inferred by averaging the lags of a sample of AGNs with similar physical properties, thus can be properly compared with predictions of AGN models. In addition, discussed are several new observational tests suggested by our simulations as well as the role of the deep high-cadence surveys of the Wide Field Survey Telescope in enriching our knowledge of the lags.

  We investigate active galactic nuclei (AGN) feeding through the molecular gas (CO(2-1) emission) properties of the local Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593, using Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations and other multi-wavelength data. Our study aims to understand the interplay between the AGN and the interstellar medium (ISM) in this galaxy, examining the role of the AGN in steering gas dynamics within its host galaxy, evaluating the energy injected into the ISM, and determining whether gas is inflowing or outflowing from the galaxy. After reducing the ALMA CO(2-1) images, we employed two models, 3D-Barolo and DISCFIT, to construct a disc model and fit its emission to the ALMA data. Additionally, we used photometric data to build a spectral energy distribution (SED) and applied the CIGALE code to derive key physical properties of the AGN and its host. Our analysis reveals a complex interplay within NGC 4593, including a clear rotational pattern, the influence of a non-axisymmetric bar potential, and a central molecular zone (CMZ)-like ring. We observe an outflow of CO(2-1) gas along the minor axis, at a distance of approximately 220 pc from the nucleus. The total molecular gas mass is estimated to be between $1 - 5 \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, with non-circular motions contributing about 10\%. Our SED analysis indicates an AGN fraction of 0.88 and a star formation rate (SFR) of 0.42 $M_{\odot} \, \text{yr}^{-1}$. These findings highlight the complex dynamics in the centre of NGC 4593, which are significantly influenced by the presence of the AGN. The overall physical properties of this system suggest that the AGN has a substantial impact on the evolution of NGC 4593.   

Partially Ionized Gas at Equilibrium Powered by Ultraviolet Irradiation

  We study the formation of a partially ionized zone behind the usual H II zone in photo-ionized gas. While Lyman continuum photons are depleted before reaching this zone, Balmer continuum photons can ionize the $n=2$ hydrogen atoms as those are pumped by scattering-trapped Ly$\alpha$ photons. Ly$\alpha$ photons need to be replenished in a steady state, but fast radiative cooling at high gas temperature makes replenishment through electron collisional excitation of $n=2$ inefficient. Independently of the temperature, Raman scattering of incident continuum photons on the Lyman-series damping wings injects Ly$\alpha$ photons in the line core and pumps the $n=2$ state, which helps realize a partially ionized equilibrium at $5000$--$7000\,$K. Since the ratio between the incident radiation flux and gas density is limited by the dynamic effects of radiation pressure, significant ionization fraction is only realized at densities $n_{\rm H} \gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, intermediate between ordinary H II regions and AGN Broad Line Regions. A large H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ line ratio results from such partially ionized gas as large Balmer line optical depths enhance the $n=3$ population relative to higher $n$ states. Partial ionization also provides the ideal condition for internally forming an intense and very broad Ly$\alpha$ line, which can power strong fluorescent metal emission lines observed from the Weigelt blobs of $\eta$ Carinae in the Galaxy, and from a candidate young super star cluster in the Cosmic Noon Sunburst galaxy. This phenomenon may also have implications for understanding the spectra of high-$z$ galaxies that show unusually dense ionized gas.

  We present results of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive protocluster down to redshift $z\approx4$ (when the halo mass is $\approx10^{13}$ M$_\odot$) using the SWIFT code and the EAGLE galaxy formation model, focusing on supermassive black hole (BH) physics. The BH was seeded with a mass of $10^4$ M$_\odot$ at redshift $z\approx17$. We compare the base model that uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic feedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as well as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows at the Eddington limit from $z=9$ to $z=5.5$, when it becomes massive enough to halt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that allowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH going through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around $z\approx7.5$, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude, before feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By $z\approx4$ the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases, and an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching values of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our simulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass$-$stellar mass relation inferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy formation models using the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology are capable of reproducing the observed massive BHs at high redshift. Allowing jets, either at super- or sub-Eddington rates, has little impact on the host galaxy properties, but leads to lower BH masses as a result of stronger self-regulation, which is itself a consequence of higher feedback efficiencies.

  The Eigenvector 1 schema, or the main sequence of quasars, was introduced as an analogous scheme to the HR diagram that would allow us to understand the more complex, extended sources - active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that harbor accreting supermassive black holes. The study has spanned more than three decades and has advanced our knowledge of the diversity of Type-1 AGNs from both observational and theoretical aspects. The quasar main sequence, in its simplest form, is the plane between the FWHM of the broad H$\beta$ emission line and the strength of the optical FeII emission to the H$\beta$. While the former allows the estimation of the black hole mass, the latter enables direct measurement of the metal content and traces the accretion rate of the AGN. Together, they allow us to track the evolution of AGN in terms of the activity of the central nuclei, its effect on the line-emitting regions surrounding the AGN, and their diversity making them suitable distance indicators to study the expansion of our Universe. This mini-review aims to provide (i) a brief history leading up to the present day in the study of the quasar main sequence, (ii) introduce us to the many possibilities to study AGNs with the main sequence as a guiding tool, and (iii) highlight some recent, exciting lines of researches at the frontier of this ever-growing field.
