  Context. To date, three nuclear transients have been associated with high-energy neutrino events. These transients are generally thought to be powered by tidal disruptions of stars (TDEs) by massive black holes. However, AT2019aalc, hosted in a Seyfert-1 galaxy, was not yet classified due to a lack of multiwavelength observations. Interestingly, the source has re-brightened 4 years after its discovery. Aims. We aim to classify the transient and explain the mechanism responsible for its second optical flare. Methods. We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring program (from radio to X-rays) of AT2019aalc during its re-brightening in 2023. Results. The observations revealed a uniquely bright UV counterpart and multiple X-ray flares during the second optical flaring episode of the transient. The second flare, similarly to the first one, is also accompanied by IR dust echo emission. A long-term radio flare is found with an inverted spectrum. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of Bowen Fluorescence lines and strong high-ionization coronal lines indicating an extreme level of ionization in the system. Conclusions. The results suggest that the transient can be classified as a Bowen Fluorescence Flare (BFF), a relatively new sub-class of flaring active galactic nuclei (AGN). AT2019aalc can be also classified as an extreme coronal line emitter (ECLE). We found that, in addition to AT2019aalc, another BFF AT2021loi is spatially coincident with a high-energy neutrino event. The multi-wavelength properties of these transients suggest a possible connection between ECLEs, BFFs and TDEs in AGN.

  Using the light curve time series data for more than 11.7 million variable sources published in the Gaia Data Release 3, the average magnitudes, colors, and variability parameters have been computed for 0.836 million Gaia CRF objects, which are mostly quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). To mitigate the effects of occasional flukes in the data, robust statistical measures have been employed, namely, the median, median absolute deviation, and Spearman correlation. We find that the majority of the CRF sources have moderate amplitudes of variability in the Gaia $G$ band just below 0.1 mag. The heavy-tailed distribution of variability amplitudes (quantified as robust standard deviations) does not find a single analytical form, but is closer to Maxwell distribution with a scale of 0.078 mag. The majority of CRF sources have positive correlations between $G$ magnitude and $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}$ colors, meaning that these quasars and AGNs become bluer when they are brighter. The variations in the BP and RP bands are also mostly positively correlated. Dependencies of all variability parameters with cosmological redshift are fairly flat for the more accurate estimates above redshift 0.7, while the median color shows strong systematic variations with redshift. Using a robust normalized score of magnitude deviations, a sample of 5000 most variable quasars is selected and published. The intersection of this sample with the ICRF3 catalog shows a much higher rate of strongly variable quasars (mostly, blazars) in ICRF3.

  In the era of massive photometric surveys, we explore several approaches to estimate the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) from optical ground-based imaging, in each case comparing to the independent SMBH mass measurement obtained from spectroscopic data. We select a case-study sample of 28 type 1 AGN hosted by nearby galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We perform multi-component spectral decomposition, extract the AGN component and calculate the SMBH mass from the broad H$\alpha$ emission line width and luminosity. The photometric $g$ and $i$ band data is decomposed into AGN+spheroid(+disc)(+bar) components with careful surface brightness fitting. From these, the SMBH mass is estimated using its relation with the spheroid S\'ersic index or effective radius (both used for the first time on ground-based optical imaging of AGN); and the more widely used scaling relations based on bulge or galaxy stellar mass. We find no correlation between the H$\alpha$-derived SMBH masses and those based on the spheroid S\'ersic index or effective radius, despite these being the most direct methods involving only one scaling relation. The bulge or galaxy stellar mass based methods both yield significant correlations, although with considerable scatter and, in the latter case, a systematic offset. We provide possible explanations for this and discuss the requirements, advantages and drawbacks of each method. These considerations will be useful to optimise stategies for upcoming high quality ground-based and space-borne sky surveys to estimate SMBH masses in large numbers of AGN.

  We present a kinematic analysis based on the large Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) dataset of SDSS-IV MaNGA (10.000 galaxies). We have compiled a diverse sample of 594 unique Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), identified through a variety of independent selection techniques, encompassing radio (1.4 GHz) observations, optical emission line diagnostics (BPT), broad Balmer emission lines, mid-infrared colors, and hard X-ray emission. We investigate how ionized gas kinematics behave in these different AGN populations through stacked radial profiles of the [OIII]~5007 emission-line width across each AGN population. We contrast AGN populations against each other (and non-AGN galaxies) by matching samples by stellar mass, [OIII]~5007 luminosity, morphology, and redshift. We find similar kinematics between AGN selected by BPT diagnostics compared to broad-line selected AGN. We also identify a population of non-AGN with similar radial profiles as AGN, indicative of the presence of remnant outflows (or fossil outflows) of a past AGN activity. We find that purely radio-selected AGN display enhanced ionized gas line widths across all radii. This suggests that our radio-selection technique is sensitive to a population where AGN-driven kinematic perturbations have been active for longer durations (potentially due to recurrent activity) than in purely optically selected AGN. This connection between radio activity and extended ionized gas outflow signatures is consistent with recent evidence that suggests radio emission (expected to be diffuse) originated due to shocks from outflows. We conclude that different selection techniques can trace different AGN populations not only in terms of energetics but also in terms of AGN evolutionary stages. Our results are important in the context of AGN duty cycle and highlight IFU data's potential to deepen our knowledge of AGN and galaxy evolution.

  The energy released by AGN has the potential to heat or remove the gas of the ISM, thus likely impacting the cold molecular gas reservoir of host galaxies at first, with star formation following on longer timescales. Previous works on high-z galaxies have yielded conflicting results, possibly due to selection biases and other systematics. To provide a reliable benchmark for galaxy evolution models at cosmic noon (z=1-3), two surveys were conceived: SUPER and KASHz, both targeting unbiased X-ray-selected AGN at z&gt;1 that span a wide bolometric luminosity range. In this paper, we assess the effects of AGN feedback on the molecular gas content of host galaxies in a statistically robust, uniformly selected, coherently analyzed sample of AGN at z=1-2.6, drawn from the KASHz and SUPER surveys. By using ALMA data in combination with dedicated SED modeling, we retrieve CO and FIR luminosity as well as $M_*$ of SUPER and KASHz AGN. We selected non-active galaxies from PHIBBS, ASPECS and multiple ALMA/NOEMA surveys of sub-mm galaxies. By matching the samples in z, $M_*$ and $L_{FIR}$, we compared the properties of AGN and non-active galaxies within a Bayesian framework. We find that AGN hosts at given $L_{FIR}$ are on average CO depleted compared to non-active galaxies, confirming what was previously found in the SUPER survey. Moreover, the molecular gas fraction distributions of AGN and non-active galaxies are statistically different, with that of of AGN being skewed to lower values. Our results indicate that AGN can indeed reduce the total cold molecular gas reservoir of their host galaxies. Lastly, by comparing our results with predictions from three cosmological simulations (TNG, Eagle and Simba) filtered to match the observed properties, we confirm already known discrepancies and highlight new ones between observations and simulations.[Abridged]
