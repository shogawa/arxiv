  While in massive galaxies active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback plays an important role, the role of AGN feedback is still under debate in dwarf galaxies. With well spatially resolved data obtained from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), we identify a spatially extended ($\rm \sim 3\; kpc$) and fast ($V_{80} \sim 471\; \rm km\;s^{-1}$) AGN-driven outflow in a dwarf galaxy: SDSS J022849.51-090153.8 with $M_{*} \sim 10^{9.6}\;{\rm M_{\odot}}$ that host an intermediate-mass black hole of $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^5\;{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and $L_{\rm AGN}/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.15$. Through the measurement of the rotation curve, we estimate the escape velocity of the halo and the ratio of the outflow velocity to the halo escape velocity to be $1.09\pm0.04$, indicating that the outflow is capable of escaping not only the galaxy disk but the halo. The outflow size of our AGN is found to be larger than AGN in massive galaxies at the given AGN [O III] luminosity, while the size of the photo-ionized narrow-line region is comparable. These results suggest the important role of AGN feedback through outflows in dwarf galaxies when their central intermediate-mass black holes accrete at high-Eddington ratios.

  Dual super massive black holes at sub-kpc to kpc scales, the product of galaxy mergers, are progenitors of eventually coalescing binary SMBHs. If both or one of the dual SMBHs are accreting, they may appear as dual AGNs or off-nucleus AGNs. Studying such systems is essential to learn the dynamical evolution of binary SMBHs as well as the process of galaxy merging. Recently a novel astrometry-based method named varstrometry has been put forward to search for dual SMBHs at high redshift, as the unsynchronized flux variability of dual AGNs (or off-nucleus AGNs) will cause astrometric jitters detectable by Gaia without spatially resolving them. Based on Gaia varstrometry we select a rare sample of 5 radio loud quasars with clear Gaia astrometric jitters. With e-MERLIN observations we have revealed a single compact radio source for each of them. Remarkably all but one exhibit clear Gaia-radio offsets of ~ 9 -- 60 mas. The observed Gaia jitters appear consistent with the expected values. These detected Gaia-radio offsets suggest these candidate dual SMBHs may have projected separations as small as ~ 0.01 -- 0.1'' (~ 0.1 kpc, depending on the optical flux ratio of two SMBHs). Meanwhile, this work highlights the remarkably high efficiency of Gaia varstrometry selection of jittering sources.

  We develop a random forest regressor (RFR) machine learning model to trace the coronal evolution in two highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) IRAS 13224-3809 and 1H 0707-495 observed with XMM-Newton, by probing the X-ray reverberation features imprinted on their power spectral density (PSD) profiles. Simulated PSDs in the form of a power-law, with similar frequency range and bins to the observed data, are produced. Then, they are convolved with relativistic disc-response functions from a lamp-post source before being used to train and test the model to predict the coronal height. We remove some bins that are dominated by Poisson noise and find that the model can tolerate the frequency-bin removal up to $\sim 10$ bins to maintain a prediction accuracy of $R^{2} &gt; 0.9$. The black hole mass and inclination should be fixed so that the accuracy in predicting the source height is still $&gt; 0.9$. The accuracy also increases with the reflection fraction. The corona heights for both AGN are then predicted using the RFR model developed from the simulated PSDs whose frequency range and bins are specifically adjusted to match those from each individual observation. The model suggests that their corona varies between $\sim~5 - 18~r_{\rm g}$, with $R^{2} &gt; 0.9$ for all observations. Such high accuracy can still be obtained if the difference between the true mass and the trained value is $\lesssim 10\%$. Finally, the model supports the height-changing corona under the light-bending scenario where the height is correlated to source luminosity in both IRAS 13224-3809 and 1H 0707-495.

  We investigated a scenario where the presence of a broad absorption line (BAL) feature in quasars (QSOs) is contingent upon the line of sight being situated within an outflow cone emanating from the source. We examined the mechanism of dust-driven winds based on the failed radiatively accelerated dusty outflow (FRADO) model proposed by Czerny &amp; Hryniewicz, letting it be responsible for the formation of massive outflow. We calculated the probability of observing the BAL effect from the geometry of outflow which is a function of global parameters of black hole mass (M$_{BH}$), Eddington ratio ($\alpha_{Edd}$), and metallicity (Z). We then compared the results with prevalence of BAL QSOs in a sample of observational data from SDSS. The consistency of our model with the data supports the interpretation of the BAL phenomenon as a result of source orientation, rather than a transitory stage in AGN evolution

  A large fraction of the accreting supermassive black hole population is shrouded by copious amounts of gas and dust, particularly in the distant ($z\gtrsim1$) Universe. While much of the obscuration is attributed to a parsec-scale torus, there is a known contribution from the larger-scale host galaxy. Using JWST/NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey, we probe the galaxy-wide dust distribution in X-ray selected AGN up to $z\sim2$. Here, we focus on a sample of three AGNs with their host galaxies exhibiting prominent dust lanes, potentially due to their edge-on alignment. These represent 27% (3 out of 11 with early NIRCam data) of the heavily obscured ($N_H&gt;10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGN population. With limited signs of a central AGN in the optical and near-infrared, the NIRCam images are used to produce reddening maps $E(B-V)$ of the host galaxies. We compare the mean central value of $E(B-V)$ to the X-ray obscuring column density along the line-of-sight to the AGN ($N_H\sim10^{23-23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$). We find that the extinction due to the host galaxy is present ($0.6\lesssim E(B-V) \lesssim 0.9$; $1.9 \lesssim A_V \lesssim 2.8$) and significantly contributes to the X-ray obscuration at a level of $N_H\sim10^{22.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ assuming an SMC gas-to-dust ratio which amounts to $\lesssim$30% of the total obscuring column density. These early results, including three additional cases from CEERS, demonstrate the ability to resolve such dust structures with JWST and separate the different circumnuclear and galaxy-scale obscuring structures.

  We explored the parsec-scale nuclear regions of a sample of radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) using the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astronomy (VERA) wideband (at a recording rate of $16\,\mathrm{Gbps}$) polarimetry at 22 and 43 GHz. Our targets include 1H 0323+342, SBS 0846+513, PMN J0948+0022, 1219+044, PKS 1502+036 and TXS 2116-077, which are all known to exhibit $\gamma$-ray emission indicative of possessing highly beamed jets similar to blazars. For the first time, we unambiguously detected Faraday rotation toward the parsec-scale radio core of NLSy1s, with a median observed core rotation measure (RM) of $2.7\times 10^3\,{\rm rad\,m^{-2}}$ (or $6.3\times 10^3\,{\rm rad\,m^{-2}}$ for redshift-corrected). This level of RM magnitude is significantly larger than those seen in the core of BL Lac objects (BLOs; a dominant subclass of blazars), suggesting that the nuclear environment of NLSy1s is more gas-rich than that in BLOs. Interestingly, the observed parsec-scale polarimetric properties of NLSy1s (low core fractional polarization, large core RM and jet-EVPA misalignment) are rather similar to those of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Our results are in accordance with the scenario that NLSy1s are in an early stage of AGN evolution with their central black hole masses being smaller than those of more evolved FSRQs.

  In this work, we study the relation of cosmic environment and morphology with the star-formation (SF) and the stellar population of galaxies. Most importantly, we examine if this relation differs for systems with active and non-active supermassive black holes. For that purpose, we use 551 X-ray detected active galactic nuclei (AGN) and 16,917 non-AGN galaxies in the COSMOS-Legacy survey, for which the surface-density field measurements are available. The sources lie at redshift of $\rm 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.2$, probe X-ray luminosities of $\rm 42&lt;log\,[L_{X,2-10keV}(erg\,s^{-1})]&lt;44$ and have stellar masses, $\rm 10.5&lt;log\,[M_*(M_\odot)]&lt;11.5$. Our results show that isolated AGN (field) have lower SFR compared to non AGN, at all L$_X$ spanned by our sample. However, in denser environments (filaments, clusters), moderate L$_X$ AGN ($\rm log\,[L_{X,2-10keV}(erg\,s^{-1})]&gt;43$) and non-AGN galaxies have similar SFR. We, also, examine the stellar populations and the morphology of the sources in different cosmic fields. For the same morphological type, non-AGN galaxies tend to have older stellar populations and are less likely to have undergone a recent burst in denser environments compared to their field counterparts. The differences in the stellar populations with the density field are, mainly, driven by quiescent systems. Moreover, low L$_X$ AGN present negligible variations of their stellar populations, in all cosmic environments, whereas moderate L$_X$ AGN have, on average, younger stellar populations and are more likely to have undergone a recent burst, in high density fields. Finally, in the case of non-AGN galaxies, the fraction of bulge-dominated (BD) systems increases with the density field, while BD AGN are scarce in denser environments. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which a common mechanism, such as mergers, triggers both the SF and the AGN activity.
