  The James Webb Space Telescope has uncovered a puzzling population of UV-faint broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN), nicknamed ``Little Red Dots'' (LRD) owing to their compact morphology and red rest-frame optical colours. Interpreted as dust attenuated AGN, their inferred intrinsic luminosities and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses rival those of UV-luminous quasars, although they are $&gt;100$ times more abundant. If LRDs and quasars are members of the same underlying population, they should inhabit comparable mass dark matter halos, traced by similar overdensities of galaxies. Otherwise, they represent distinct populations with different physical properties and formation histories. Characterizing LRD environments thus provides a critical test of their nature. Here, we report the discovery of a LRD at $z=7.3$, attenuated by moderate amounts of dust, $A_V = {3.26}\,\rm{mag}$, with an intrinsic bolometric luminosity of $10^{46.7}\,\rm{erg}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ and a SMBH mass of $7\times10^8\,\rm{M}_\odot$. Most notably, this object is embedded in an overdensity of eight nearby galaxies, allowing us to calculate the first spectroscopic estimate of the clustering of galaxies around LRDs. We find a LRD-galaxy cross-correlation length of $r_0\!=\!9\pm2\,\rm{h}^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, comparable to that of $z\!\sim\!6$ UV-luminous quasars. The resulting estimate of their minimum dark matter halo mass of $\log_{10}(M_{\rm{halo, min}}/\rm{M}_{\odot})= 12.3_{-0.8}^{+0.7}$ indicates that nearly all halos above this mass must host actively accreting SMBHs at $z\approx7$, in strong contrast with the far smaller duty cycle of luminous quasars ($&lt;1\%$). Our results, taken at face value, motivate a picture in which LRDs are the obscured counterparts of UV-luminous quasars, which provides a natural explanation for the short UV-luminous lifetimes inferred from both quasar clustering and quasar proximity zones.

  We use the Monte Carlo For AGN (active galactic nucleus) Channel Testing and Simulation (McFACTS, https://www.github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts) code to study the effect of AGN disk and nuclear star cluster parameters on predicted mass distributions for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) compact binaries forming in AGN disks. The assumptions we vary include the black hole (BH) initial mass function, disk model, disk size, disk lifetime, and the prograde-to-retrograde fraction of newly formed black hole binaries. Broadly we find that dense, moderately short-lived AGN disks are preferred for producing a $(q,\chi_{\rm eff})$ anti-correlation like those identified from existing gravitational wave (GW) observations. Additionally, a BH initial mass function (MF $\propto M^{-2}$) is preferred over a more top-heavy MF ($M^{-1}$). The preferred fraction of prograde-to-retrograde is $&gt;90\%$, to produce results consistent with observations.

  We present a detailed analysis of EELG1002: a $z = 0.8275$ EELG identified within archival Gemini/GMOS spectroscopy as part of the COSMOS Spectroscopic Archive. Combining GMOS spectra and available multi-wavelength photometry, we find EELG1002 is a low-mass ($10^{7 - 8}$ M$_\odot$), compact ($\sim 530$ pc), and bursty star-forming galaxy with mass doubling timescales of $\sim 5 - 15$ Myr. EELG1002 has record-breaking rest-frame [OIII]+H$\beta$ EW of $\sim 2800 - 3700$\AA~which is $\sim 16 - 35 \times$ higher than typical $z \sim 0.8$ [OIII] emitters with similar stellar mass and even higher than typical $z &gt; 5$ galaxies. We find no clear evidence of an AGN suggesting the emission lines are star formation driven. EELG1002 is chemically unevolved (direct $T_e$; $12+\log_{10} (\textrm{O/H}) \sim 7.5$ consistent with $z &gt; 5$ galaxies at fixed stellar mass) and may be undergoing a first intense, bursty star formation phase analogous to conditions expected of galaxies in the early Universe. We find evidence for a highly energetic ISM ([OIII]/[OII] $\sim 11$) and hard ionizing radiation field (elevated [NeIII]/[OII] at fixed [OIII]/[OII]). Coupled with its compact, metal-poor, and actively star-forming nature, EELG1002 is found to efficiently produce ionizing photons with $\xi_{ion} \sim 10^{25.70 - 25.75}$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz and may have $\sim 10 - 20\%$ LyC escape fraction suggesting such sources may be important reionization-era analogs. We find dynamical mass of $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ suggesting copious amounts of gas to support intense star-formation activity as also suggested by analogs identified in Illustris-TNG. EELG1002 may be an ideal low-$z$ laboratory of galaxies in the early Universe and demonstrates how archival datasets can support high-$z$ science and next-generation surveys planned with \textit{Euclid} and \textit{Roman}.

  Quenching of star-formation plays a fundamental role in galaxy evolution. This process occurs due to the removal of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) or stabilization against collapse, so that gas cannot be used in the formation of new stars. In this paper, we study the effect of different mechanisms of ISM removal. In particular, we revised the well-known Baldwin-Philips-Terlevich (BPT) and $\mathrm{EW_{H\alpha}}$ vs. $\mathrm{[NII]/H\alpha}$ (WHAN) emission-line ratio diagnostics, so that we could classify all galaxies, even those not detected at some emission lines, introducing several new spectral classes. We use spectroscopic data and several physical parameters of 2409 dusty early-type galaxies in order to find out the dominant ionization source [active galactic nuclei (AGNs), young massive stars, hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES)] and its effect on the ISM. We find that strong AGNs can play a significant role in the ISM removal process only for galaxies with ages lower than $10^{9.4}$ yr, but we cannot rule out the influence of weak AGNs at any age. For older galaxies, HOLMES/planetary nebulae contribute significantly to the ISM removal process. Additionally, we provide the BPT and WHAN classifications not only for the selected sample but also for all 300000 galaxies in the GAMA fields.
