  We present the first statistical investigation of spatially resolved emission-line properties in a sample of 63 low-mass galaxies at $4\leq z&lt;10$, using JWST/NIRSpec MSA data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic (JADES) survey focusing on deep, spatially resolved spectroscopy in the GOODS-S extragalactic field. By performing a stacking of the 2D spectra of the galaxies in our sample, we find an increasing or flat radial trend with increasing radius for [OIII]$\lambda5007$/H$\beta$ and a decreasing one for [NeIII]$\lambda3869$/[OII]$\lambda3727$ (3--4 $\sigma$ significance). These results are still valid when stacking the sample in two redshift bins (i.e., $4\leq z&lt;5.5$ and $5.5\leq z&lt;10$). The comparison with star-formation photoionization models suggests that the ionization parameter increases by $\sim 0.5$ dex with redshift. We find a tentative metallicity gradient that increases with radius (i.e., 'inverted') in both redshift bins. Moreover, our analysis reveals strong negative gradients for the equivalent width of \Hbeta (7$\sigma$ significance). This trend persists even after removing known AGN candidates, therefore, it is consistent with a radial gradient primarily in stellar age and secondarily in metallicity. Taken all together, our results suggest that the sample is dominated by active central star formation, with possibly inverted metallicity gradients sustained by recent episodes of accretion of pristine gas or strong radial flows. Deeper observations and larger samples are needed to confirm these preliminary results and to validate our interpretation.   

Annihilation of positrons from AGN jets as a possible source of cosmic

  The origin of the diffuse gamma-ray background in the range from hundreds keV to several MeV is not known conclusively. From current models and observations it is believed that, at least partially, this background is formed by blazars and remnants of supernovae (SN) of type Ia in distant galaxies. However, these contributions are not sufficient to reproduce the observed level of the signal. In this work we propose another source which could contribute to this background, namely the jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The composition of jets is not known, but there are observational hints that the fraction of positrons there is substantial. Positrons are partially evacuated to the intergalactic medium and partially mix with the circumgalactic medium and annihilate there comparatively quickly. Using the AGN luminosity function, we estimated the positron production rate and the contribution of the positron annihilation to the cosmic background below 511 keV. We also estimated the analogous contribution from positron annihilation within SN Ia remnants in distant galaxies. The contribution of AGNs is estimated to be a factor of 5 - 10 smaller than the observed background intensity, and the contribution from SNe is yet smaller by one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the contribution of AGNs appeared to be larger than the contribution of blazars estimated from Swift-BAT and Fermi-LAT observations. The main uncertainty in our model is the fraction of positrons remaining in the circumgalactic medium which makes our estimation an upper limit.
