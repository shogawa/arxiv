  A key feature of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is their variability across all wavelengths. Typically, AGN vary by a few tenths of a magnitude or more over periods lasting from hours to years. By contrast, extreme variability of AGN -- large luminosity changes that are a significant departure from the baseline variability -- are known as AGN flares. These events are rare and their timescales poorly constrained, with most of the literature focusing on individual events. It has been suggested that extreme AGN variability including flares can provide insights into the accretion processes in the disk. With surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) promising millions of transient detections per night in the coming decade, there is a need for fast and efficient classification of AGN flares. The problem with the systematic detection of AGN flares is the requirement to detect them against a stochastically variable baseline; the ability to define a signal as a significant departure from the ever-present variability is a statistical challenge. Recently, Gaussian Processes (GPs) have revolutionised the analysis of time-series data in many areas of astronomical research. They have, however, seen limited uptake within the field of transient detection and classification. Here we investigate the efficacy of Gaussian Processes to detect AGN flares in both simulated and real optical light curves. We show that GP analysis can successfully detect AGN flares with a false-positive rate of less than seven per cent, and we present examples of AGN light curves that show extreme variability.

  Extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could be detected by space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), TianQin and Taiji. In general, locating EMRIs by space-borne GW detectors can help us select the candidate host galaxies which can be used to infer the cosmic expansion history. In this paper, we show that the localization information of EMRIs can also be used to select the candidate host AGNs which can be used to infer the formation channel of the EMRIs and extract more precisely the redshift probability distributions of the EMRIs. Using the EMRIs that are expected to be detected by TianQin and LISA and the galaxy catalog that can be provided by the Chinese Space Station Telescope for the analysis, we find that TianQin can constrain the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ to a precision of about $3\%-8\%$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ to about $10\%-40\%$, the network composed of TianQin and LISA can improve the precisions of $H_0$ and $w_0$ to about $0.4\% - 7\%$ and $4\%-20\%$, respectively, without considering the effects of AGNs. Furthermore, combining the detected EMRIs with AGN catalog by the statistical framework of likelihood-ratio-based, we find TianQin can establish the EMRI-AGN correlation with about $500$ EMRIs if all of the EMRIs indeed originate in AGNs, and the TianQin+LISA network can reduce this required number to about $30$. Once the EMRI-AGN correlation is confirmed, the combination of the EMRIs and AGN catalog can significantly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters. These results demonstrate the potentials of using EMRIs as well as galaxy and AGN catalogs to constrain the cosmological parameters and astrophysical models.

  We present the results of a search for Extended Emission-Line Regions (EELRs) ionized by extant or recently-faded active galactic nuclei (AGN), using [O III] narrowband imaging and spectroscopic followup. The sample includes 198 galaxies in 92 strongly interacting or merging galaxy systems in the range z=0.009-0.0285. Among these, three have EELRs extended beyond 10 kpc in projection from the nucleus detected in previous studies. We identify a single new distant emission region, projected 35 kpc from UGC 5941. Our optical spectrum does not detect He II, but its strong-line ratios put this in the same class as securely characterized EELR clouds. The nucleus of UGC 5941 is dominated by recent star formation, preventing detection of any weak ongoing AGN. Overall counts of distant EELRs in this and the previous TELPERION samples give incidence 2-5% depending on galaxy and AGN selection, 20-50 times higher than the Galaxy Zoo EELR survey with its higher surface-brightness threshold and much larger input sample. AGN in interacting and merging systems have an increased detection rate $12+/-6$%, while none are detected around noninteracting AGN. Some of these AGN are at luminosity low enough to require additional X-ray or far-infrared information to tell whether the EELR ionization level suggests long-term fading.

  We present the High-$z$ Evolution of Large and Luminous Objects (HELLO) project, a set of more than 30 high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulations aimed to study Milky Way analogues ($M_\star\sim10^{10-11}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$) at high redshift, namely at $z=3.6$ (age $\sim$ 1.7 Gyr) and $z=2$ (age $\sim$ 3.3 Gyr). The HELLO project features an updated scheme for chemical enrichment and the addition of local photoionization feedback processes. Independently of redshift and stellar mass, all galaxies follow a similar evolutionary path: (i) first a smooth progression along the star formation main sequence, where galaxies grow in both stellar mass and size, (ii) a (short) period of intense star formation, which causes a contraction phase in the stellar size, until the galaxies reach their peak star formation rate (SFR), during this period we also witness a significant black hole growth, and (iii) the onset of declining SFRs, which is due to a mix of gas consumption, stellar feedback, and AGN feedback, but with AGN feedback still being subdominant with respect to stellar feedback for energy deposition. The exact phase in which a galaxy in our mass range can be found at a given redshift is set by its gas reservoir and assembly history. Finally, our galaxies are in excellent agreement with several various scaling relations observed with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, and hence can be used to provide the theoretical framework to interpret current and future observations from these facilities and shed light on the transition from star-forming to quiescent galaxies.

  We present new optical GTC/MEGARA seeing-limited (0.9") integral-field observations of NGC 5506, together with ALMA observations of the CO(3-2) transition at a 0.2" (25 pc) resolution. NGC 5506 is a luminous (bolometric luminosity of $\sim 10^{44}$ erg/s) nearby (26 Mpc) Seyfert galaxy, part of the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We modelled the CO(3-2) kinematics with 3D-Barolo, revealing a rotating and outflowing cold gas ring within the central 1.2 kpc. We derived an integrated cold molecular gas mass outflow rate for the ring of 8 M$_{\odot}$/yr. We fitted the optical emission lines with a maximum of two Gaussian components to separate rotation from non-circular motions. We detected high [OIII]$\lambda$5007 projected velocities (up to 1000 km/s) at the active galactic nucleus (AGN) position, decreasing with radius to an average 330 km/s around 350 pc. We also modelled the [OIII] gas kinematics with a non-parametric method, estimating the ionisation parameter and electron density in every spaxel, from which we derived an ionised mass outflow rate of 0.076 M$_{\odot}$/yr within the central 1.2 kpc. Regions of high CO(3-2) velocity dispersion, extending to projected distances of 350 pc from the AGN, appear to be the result from the interaction of the AGN wind with molecular gas in the galaxy's disc. Additionally, we find the ionised outflow to spatially correlate with radio and soft X-ray emission in the central kiloparsec. We conclude that the effects of AGN feedback in NGC 5506 manifest as a large-scale ionised wind interacting with the molecular disc, resulting in outflows extending to radial distances of 610 pc

  The connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host dark matter halos provides powerful insights into how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow and coevolve with their host galaxies. Here we investigate the impact of observational AGN selection on the AGN halo occupation distribution (HOD) by forward-modeling AGN activity into cosmological N-body simulations. By assuming straightforward relationships between the SMBH mass, galaxy mass, and (sub)halo mass, as well as a uniform broken power law distribution of Eddington ratios, we find that luminosity-limited AGN samples result in biased HOD shapes. While AGN defined by an Eddington ratio threshold produce AGN fractions that are flat across halo mass (unbiased by definition), luminosity-limited AGN fractions peak around galaxy-group-sized halo masses and then decrease with increasing halo mass. With higher luminosities, the rise of the AGN fraction starts at higher halo masses, the peak is shifted towards higher halo masses, and the decline at higher halo masses is more rapid. These results are consistent with recent HOD constraints from AGN clustering measurements, which find (1) characteristic halo mass scales of $\log M_{Vir}\sim$ 12 - 13 [$h^{-1}M_{\odot}$] and (2) a shallower rise of the number of satellite AGN with increasing halo mass than for the overall galaxy population. Thus the observational biases due to AGN selection can naturally explain the constant, characteristic halo mass scale inferred from large-scale AGN clustering amplitudes over a range of redshifts, as well as the measured inconsistencies between AGN and galaxy HODs. We conclude that AGN selection biases can have significant impacts on the inferred AGN HOD, and can therefore lead to possible misinterpretations of how AGN populate dark matter halos and the AGN-host galaxy connection.
