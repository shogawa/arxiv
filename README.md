  We present ALMA CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) observations of a powerful young radio galaxy, PKS 0023-26, hosted by a far-infrared bright galaxy. The galaxy has a luminous optical AGN and a very extended distribution of molecular gas. We used these observations (together with available CO(2-1) data) to trace the impact of the AGN across the extent of the radio emission and beyond on scales of a few kpc. Despite the strength of the optical AGN, the kinematics of the cold molecular gas is strongly affected only in the central kpc, and is more weakly affected around the northern lobe. We found other signatures of the substantial impact of the radio AGN, however. Most notably, extreme line ratios of the CO transitions in a region aligned with the radio axis indicate conditions very different from those observed in the undisturbed gas at large radii. The non-detection of CO(1-0) at the location of the core of the radio source implies extreme conditions at this location. Furthermore, on the scale of a few kpc, the cold molecular gas appears to be wrapped around the northern radio lobe. This suggests that a strong jet-cloud interaction has depleted the northern lobe of molecular gas, perhaps as a result of the hot wind behind the jet-induced shock that shreds the clouds via hydrodynamic instabilities. The higher gas velocity dispersion and molecular excitation that we observed close to this location may then be the result of a milder interaction in which the expanding jet cocoon induces turbulence in the surrounding interstellar medium. These results highlight that the impact of an AGN can manifest itself not only in the kinematics of the gas, but also in molecular line ratios and in the distribution of the gas. Although the radio plasma and the cold molecular gas are clearly coupled, the kinetic energy that is transferred to the ISM is only a small fraction of the energy available from the AGN.

  Molecular gas plays a critical role in regulating star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies. Sulphur bearing molecules, such as H2S, are sensitive to the physical and chemical environments in which they reside and are potential tracers of shocked, dense gas in galactic outflows and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We aim to investigate the origin of H2S emission and its relation to dense gas and outflow activity in the central regions of nearby infrared luminous galaxies. We present ALMA Band 5 observations of the ortho H2S 1(1,0) 1(0,1) transition in three nearby galaxies: NGC 1377, NGC 4418, and NGC 1266. We perform radiative transfer modelling using RADEX to constrain the physical conditions of the H2S emitting gas and compare the results to ancillary CO and continuum data. We detect compact H2S emission in all three galaxies, arising from regions smaller than approximately 150 parsecs. The H2S spectral profiles exhibit broad line wings, suggesting an association with outflowing or shocked gas. In NGC 4418, H2S also appears to be tracing gas that is counterrotating. A peculiar red shifted emission feature may correspond to inflowing gas, or possibly a slanted outflow. RADEX modelling indicates that the H2S emitting gas has high densities (molecular hydrogen density greater than 10^7 cm^-3) and moderately warm temperatures (between 40 and 200 Kelvin). The derived densities exceed those inferred from CO observations, implying that H2S traces denser regions of the interstellar medium.

  Follow-up observations of neutrino events have been a promising method for identifying sources of very-high-energy cosmic rays. Neutrinos are unambiguous tracers of hadronic interactions and cosmic rays. On June 15, 2020, IceCube detected a neutrino event with an 82.8% probability of being astrophysical in origin. To identify the astrophysical source of the neutrino, we used X-ray tiling observations to identify potential counterpart sources. We performed additional multiwavelength follow-up with NuSTAR and the VLA in order to construct a broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the most likely counterpart. From the SED, we calculate an estimate for the neutrinos we expect to detect from the source. While the source does not have a high predicted neutrino flux, it is still a plausible neutrino emitter. It is important to note that the other bright X-ray candidate sources consistent with the neutrino event are also radio-quiet AGN. A statistical analysis shows that 1RXS J093117.6+033146 is the most likely counterpart (87.5%) if the neutrino is cosmic in origin and if it is among X-ray detectable sources. This results adds to previous results suggesting a connection between radio-quiet AGN and IceCube neutrino events.

  Modelling the gravitational interaction between an eccentric perturber and a differentially shearing gas disc is a longstanding problem with various astrophysical applications, ranging from the evolution of planetary systems to the migration of black holes embedded in AGN discs. Recent work has promoted the use of a global, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the resulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we perform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this linear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In particular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for which the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We find remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology across a range of diagnostics -- lending support to the predicted wake morphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal phenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local scale height. In contrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable discrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which explore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures. Our simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced angular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear variations with eccentricity. Finally, this careful comparison between linear theory and numerics provides a detailed benchmark for planet-disc interaction problems and therefore we have provided a repository of our linear calculations for use as a rigorous test of future numerical investigations.   

Perturbing AGN Accretion Disks with Stars and Moderately Massive Black
  Holes: Implications for Changing-Look AGN and Quasi-Periodic Eruptions

  We present a model that explains some extreme variability phenomena observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this model, an orbiting companion interacts with the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This interaction excites spiral density waves, leading to bursts of mass inflow lasting a few orbital timescales, whose mass content depends sensitively on the sphere of influence of the orbiting companion. To explain changing-look (CL) AGN, we find that lighter SMBH companions are necessary, while we generally exclude stellar companions. The moderately massive black hole perturber must be on a highly eccentric orbit in order to account for the non-repeating nature of most CL AGN. When applied to quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), we find that stars with highly eccentric orbits and close pericenter passages can produce accretion flares with QPE-like characteristics. For many QPEs, low-mass main-sequence stars or stripped-envelope stars are required. Although moderately massive black hole perturbers could also match the observed properties of QPEs, the gravitational-wave merger timescales of such binary systems are prohibitively short.

  Clusters of galaxies host spectacular diffuse radio sources, extending over scales from 100 kpc to several Mpcs. These sources, with extremely faint surface brightness ($\mu$Jy/arcsec$^2$ level), are not tied to individual galaxies but trace synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic fields and relativistic particles within the intracluster environment. Here, we report the discovery of a candidate radio mini-halo in SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, the most distant cool-core galaxy cluster identified to date at $z=1.709$, using deep LOFAR 120-168 MHz observations. We show that this emission originates from diffuse cluster-associated processes rather than unresolved AGN or star-forming galaxies. The diffuse radio emission coincides spatially with the X-ray emission of the hot intracluster medium and has a radio power of $P_{\rm 150~MHz}=49.8^{+14.7}_{-11.7} \times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, exhibiting striking similarities to low-redshift radio mini-halos. This discovery doubles the redshift of previously known mini-halos, challenging models of inverse Compton losses and indicating the presence of strong magnetic fields, enhanced turbulence in high-redshift clusters, or active hadronic processes that require a cosmic ray-to-thermal energy ratio of 0.07 within 200 kpc, assuming a clumped distribution with spatial correlations among the gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic field that partially compensate for cosmological redshift dimming. It further implies that magnetic fields are efficiently amplified to $\sim$$10~\mu$G levels within a Mpc$^3$ volume during the epoch of cluster formation before $z\sim2$. These findings provide critical insights into high-redshift cluster physics and emphasize the transformative potential of next-generation radio surveys, such as those with the SKA and ngVLA, in exploring the early evolution of galaxy clusters.

  Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow primarily through gas accretion, observed as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While mergers can drive luminous AGN episodes, secular processes may fuel a substantial portion of cosmic BH growth. Whether these mechanisms can sustain high BH accretion rates remains uncertain. This study aims to identify the secular mechanism driving high BH accretion rates, by targeting a galaxy with moderately massive SMBH, high central gas densities, accretion rates of a few percent of the Eddington limit, and gas kinematics resolved close to black hole-dominated scales. A blind search led to the identification of NGC 4593, which is representative of the AGN population driving BH mass density growth since $z=1$. A prominent single-arm ("$m=1$") molecular gas spiral with ${\rm log}\,M_{\rm mol}/{\rm M}_\odot=8.1\pm0.3$ extends from 1.3$\,$kpc down to the SMBH's sphere of influence ($1.7^{+0.5}_{-0.2}\,{\rm pc}$). Star formation in the spiral is inefficient (${\rm SFR} = 4.9 \times 10^{-2} \,{\rm M}_\odot {\rm /yr}$, $\langle t_{\rm dep}\rangle=3.9 \pm 0.6\,\rm{Gyr}$), whereas inflow rate exceeds the SFR by two orders of magnitude and is sufficient to sustain the current BH accretion rate for $\geq$35$\,$Myr, enabling $\sim$10% SMBH growth. A young, lopsided stellar component (${\rm log}\,M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot=7.5-9.3$) exerts torques on the molecular gas, likely driving the gas inflow. This young stellar component may serve as both a cause and a product of sustained gas funnelling towards the SMBH. These findings provide evidence for the sustained secular $m=1$ feeding mode at high BH accretion rates, linking kpc-scale gas dynamics to the black hole's sphere of influence. This mechanism, consistent with simulation predictions, may represent a key contributor to SMBH growth in luminous AGNs since cosmic noon.
