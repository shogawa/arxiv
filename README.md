  X-ray bright optically normal galaxies (XBONGs) are galaxies with X-ray luminosities consistent with those of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) but no evidence of AGN optical emission lines. Crossmatching the Chandra Source Catalog version 2 (CSC2) with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sample of spectroscopically classified galaxies, we have identified 817 XBONG candidates with LX &gt; 1042 erg s-1 and X-ray to optical flux ratio FXO &gt; 0.1. Comparisons with WISE colors and NIR, optical, UV, and radio luminosities show that the loci of XBONGs are in-between those of control samples of normal galaxies and quasars and are consistent with low-luminosity quasars. We find that 43% of the XBONG sample have X-ray colors suggesting NH &gt; 1022 cm-2, double the fraction in the QSO sample, suggesting that a large fraction of XBONG are highly obscured AGNs. However, ~50% of the XBONGs are not obscured and have X-ray colors harder than those of normal galaxies. Some of these XBONGs have spatially extended X-ray emission. These characteristics suggest that they may be unidentified galaxy groups and clusters. Using the X-ray luminosity functions of QSOs and galaxies/groups/clusters, we estimate the approximate fraction of extended XBONGs to be &lt; 20%. We also assess the approximate fraction of XBONGs whose AGN signatures are diluted by stellar light of host galaxies to be ~30%, based on their redshift and deviation from the extrapolation of the QSO LX-Lr relation.

  In recent years, automatic classifiers of image cutouts (also called "stamps") have shown to be key for fast supernova discovery. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory will distribute about ten million alerts with their respective stamps each night, which it is expected to enable the discovery of approximately one million supernovae each year. A growing source of confusion for these classifiers is the presence of satellite glints, sequences of point-like-sources produced by rotating satellites or debris. The currently planned Rubin stamps will have a size smaller than the typical separation between these point sources. Thus, a larger field of view image stamp could enable the automatic identification of these sources. However, the distribution of larger field of view stamps would be limited by network bandwidth restrictions. We evaluate the impact of using image stamps of different angular sizes and resolutions for the fast classification of events (AGNs, asteroids, bogus, satellites, SNe, and variable stars), using available data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. We compare four scenarios: three with the same number of pixels (small field of view with high resolution, large field of view with low resolution, and a proposed multi-scale strategy) and a scenario with the full ZTF stamp that has a larger field of view and higher resolution. Our multi-scale proposal outperforms all the scenarios, with a macro f1-score of 87.39. We encourage Rubin and its Science Collaborations to consider the benefits of implementing multi-scale stamps as a possible update to the alert specification.

  Gravitational redshift is a classical effect of Einstein's General Relativity, already measured in stars, quasars and clusters of galaxies. We here identify the signature of gravitational redshift in the emission lines of active galaxies due to supermassive black holes and discuss their impact on cosmological inference from type Ia supernovae. Firstly, from the full width at half maximum of $H_{\beta}$ lines of 75 Seyfert type I galaxies of the AGN Black Hole Mass Database, we derive a gravitational redshift $z_g = (2.4 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{-4}$. Expanding this analysis to 86755 quasars from DR14 of SDSS we have a mean value $z_g \approx 2.7 \times 10^{-4}$. Then, by comparing the redshifts of 34 lines measured at the central and outer regions of LINER galaxies in the SAMI survey we obtain $z_g = (0.68 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{-4}$. These numbers are compatible with central black holes of $\approx 10^9$ solar masses and broad line regions of $\approx 1$~pc. For non-AGN galaxies the gravitational redshift is compatible with zero and, as they constitute most of SNe Ia host galaxies, the impact on the cosmological parameters is negligible.
