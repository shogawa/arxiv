  Hot dust in the proximity of AGNs strongly emits in the Near Infrared producing a red excess that, in type 2 sources, can be modeled to measure its temperature. In the era of high spatial-resolution multi-wavelength data, mapping the hot dust around Supermassive Black Holes is important for the efforts to achieve a complete picture of the dust role and distribution around these compact objects.   In this work we propose a methodology to detect the hot dust emission in the proximity of Type 2 AGNs and measure its temperature using K-band spectra ($\lambda_c$ = 2.2\,$\mu$m).   To achieve this, we have developed NIRDust, a Python package for modeling K-band spectra, estimate the dust temperature and characterize the involved uncertainties. We tested synthetic and real spectra in order to check the performance and suitability of the physical model over different types of data.   Our tests on synthetic spectra demonstrated that the obtained results are influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the input spectra. However, we accurately characterized the uncertainties, which remained below $\sim$150 K for an average S/N per pixel exceeding 20. Applying NIRDust to NGC 5128 (Centaurus A), observed with the Gemini South Telescope, we estimated a dust temperature of 662 and 667 K from Flamingos-2 spectra and 697 and 607 K from GNIRS spectra using two different approaches.

  The astrophysical origin of binary black hole (BBH) mergers remains uncertain though many events have been observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. Such mergers are predicted to originate in the vicinity of massive black holes (MBHs). Especially, GW190814, due to its secondary mass and mass ratio being beyond the expectations of isolated stellar evolution theories, is a promising event that has happened in an active galactic nucleus(AGN) disk. In this model, a compact object resides in the vicinity of a merging BBH. Here we report multiple pieces of evidence pointing to the fact that GW190814 is a BBH merging near a compact object. The orbital motion of BBHs around the third body produces a line-of-sight acceleration (LSA) and induces a varying Doppler shift. Using a waveform template that considers LSA, we perform Bayesian inference on a few BBH events with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC). Compared to the model for isolated BBH mergers, we obtain significantly higher network signal-to-noise ratios for GW190814 by that with the LSA and constrain the LSA to $a = 0.0014^{+0.0014}_{-0.0022} ~c~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. In addition, the logarithmic Bayes factor for the LSA case over the isolated case is $16.6$, which means the LSA model is significantly preferred by the GW data. We conclude that this is the first indication showing merging BBHs are located near a compact object.

  Most tidal disruption events (TDEs) are currently found in time-domain optical and soft X-ray surveys, both of which are prone to significant obscuration. The infrared (IR), however, is a powerful probe of dust-enshrouded environments, and hence, we recently performed a systematic search of NEOWISE mid-IR data for nearby, obscured TDEs within roughly 200 Mpc. We identified 18 TDE candidates in galactic nuclei, using difference imaging to uncover nuclear variability amongst significant host galaxy emission. These candidates were selected based on the following IR light curve properties: (1) $L_\mathrm{W2}\gtrsim10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak, (2) fast rise, followed by a slow, monotonic decline, (3) no significant prior variability, and (4) no evidence for AGN activity in WISE colors. The majority of these sources showed no variable optical counterpart, suggesting that optical surveys indeed miss numerous obscured TDEs. Using narrow line ionization levels and variability arguments, we identified 6 sources as possible underlying AGN, yielding a total of 12 TDEs in our gold sample. This gold sample yields a lower limit on the IR-selected TDE rate of $2.0\pm0.3\times10^{-5}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$ ($1.3\pm0.2\times10^{-7}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ year$^{-1}$), which is comparable to optical and X-ray TDE rates. The IR-selected TDE host galaxies do not show a green valley overdensity nor a preference for quiescent, Balmer strong galaxies, which are both overrepresented in optical and X-ray TDE samples. This IR-selected sample represents a new population of dusty TDEs that have historically been missed by optical and X-ray surveys and helps alleviate tensions between observed and theoretical TDE rates and the so-called missing energy problem.

  Iron K$\alpha$ (Fe K$\alpha$) emission is observed ubiquitously in AGN, and it is a powerful probe of their circumnuclear environment. Examinations of the emission line play a pivotal role in understanding the disk geometry surrounding the black hole. It has been suggested that the torus and the broad line region (BLR) are the origins of emission. However, there is no universal location for the emitting region relative to the BLR. Here, we present an analysis of the narrow component of the Fe K$\alpha$ line in the Seyfert AGN MCG-5-23-16, one of the brightest AGN in X-rays and in Fe K$\alpha$ emission, to localize the emitting region. Spectra derived from Chandra/HETGS observations show asymmetry in the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line, which has only been confirmed before in the AGN NGC 4151. Models including relativistic Doppler broadening and gravitational redshifts are preferred over simple Gaussians and measure radii consistent with $R \simeq$ 200-650 r$_g$. These results are consistent with those of NGC 4151 and indicate that the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line in MCG-5-23-16 is primarily excited in the innermost part of the optical broad line region (BLR), or X-ray BLR. Characterizing the properties of the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line is essential for studying the disk geometries of the AGN population and mapping their innermost regions.
