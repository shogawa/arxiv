  X-ray spectroscopy of heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) offers a unique opportunity to study the circum-nuclear environment of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, individual models describing the obscurer have unique parameter spaces that give distinct parameter posterior distributions when fit to the same data. To assess the impact of model-specific parameter dependencies, we present a case study of the nearby heavily obscured low-luminosity AGN NGC 3982, which has a variety of column density estimations reported in the literature. We fit the same broadband XMM-Newton + NuSTAR spectra of the source with five unique obscuration models and generate posterior parameter distributions for each. By using global parameter exploration, we traverse the full prior-defined parameter space to accurately reproduce complex posterior shapes and inter-parameter degeneracies. The unique model posteriors for the line-of-sight column density are broadly consistent, predicting Compton-thick $N_{\rm H}$ $&gt;1.5\times10^{24}\rm cm^{-2}$ at the 3$\sigma$ confidence level. The posterior median intrinsic X-ray luminosity in the 2-10 keV band however was found to differ substantially, with values in the range log $L_{ 2-10\,{\rm keV}}$ergs$^{-1}$ = 40.9-42.1 for the individual models. We additionally show that the posterior distributions for each model occupy unique regions of their respective multi-dimensional parameters spaces, and how such differences can propagate into the inferred properties of the central engine. We conclude by showcasing the improvement in parameter inference attainable with the High Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P) with a uniquely broad simultaneous and high-sensitivity bandpass of 0.2-80 keV.

  We present the multi-epoch analysis of 13 variable, nearby (z&lt;0.1), Compton-thin (22&lt;logN_H&lt;24) active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected from the 105-month BAT catalog. Analyzing all available archival soft and hard X-ray observations, we investigate the line-of-sight hydrogen column density (N_H) variability on timescales ranging from a few days to approximately 20 years. Each source is analyzed by simultaneously modeling the data with three physical torus models, providing tight constraints on torus properties, including the covering factor, the cloud dispersion, and the torus average hydrogen column density (N_H,av). For each epoch, we measure the N_H and categorize the source as `N_H Variable', `Non-variable in N_H', or `Undetermined' based on the degree of variability. Our final sample includes 27 variable, Compton-thin AGN after implementing another 14 AGN analyzed in our previous work. We find that all sources require either flux or N_H variability. We classify 37% of them as `N_H Variable', 44% as `Non-variable in N_H', and 19% as `Undetermined'. Noticeably, there is no discernible difference between geometrical and intrinsic properties among the three variability classes, suggesting no intrinsic differences between the N_H-variable and non-variable sources. We measure the median variation in N_H between any observation pair of the same source to be 25% with respect to the lowest N_H measure in the pair. Furthermore, 48% of the analyzed sources require the inclusion of a Compton-thick reflector in the spectral fitting. Among these, the 30% exhibits recorded 22 GHz water megamaser emission, suggesting a potential shared nature between the two structures.

  We investigated the gas obscuration and host galaxy properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN) during the peak of cosmic accretion growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshift 0.8-1.8 using X-ray detected AGN with mid-infrared and far-infrared detection. The sample was classified as type-1 and type-2 AGN using optical spectral and morphological classification while the host galaxy properties were estimated with multiwavelength SED fitting. For type-1 AGN, the black hole mass was determined from MgII emission lines while the black hole mass of type-2 AGN was inferred from the host galaxy's stellar mass. Based on the derived parameters, the distribution of the sample in the absorption hydrogen column density ($N_{\rm H}$) vs. Eddington ratio diagram is examined. Among the type-2 AGN, $28\pm5$\% are in the forbidden zone, where the obscuration by dust torus cannot be maintained due to radiation pressure on dusty material. The fraction is higher than that observed in the local universe from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) data release 2 ($11\pm3$\%). The higher fraction implies that the obscuration of the majority of AGN is consistent with the radiation pressure regulated unified model but with an increased incidence of interstellar matter (ISM) obscured AGN. We discuss the possibility of dust-free absorption in type-1 AGN and heavy ISM absorption in type-2 AGN. We also find no statistical difference in the star-formation activity between type-1 and type-2 AGN which may suggest that obscuration triggered by a gas-rich merging is not common among X-ray detected AGN in this epoch.
