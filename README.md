  Magnetic fields regulate black hole (BH) accretion, governing both the inflow and outflow dynamics. When a BH becomes saturated with large-scale vertical magnetic flux, it enters a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD) state. The dynamically-important BH magnetic flux powers highly efficient relativistic outflows (or jets) and sporadically erupts from the BH into the disk midplane. Here we explore the evolution of MADs when the BH and gas angular momentum are misaligned, which is expected to be more common. Using numerical simulations, we find that jets from rapidly spinning, prograde BHs force the inner accretion flow into alignment with the BH spin via the magneto-spin alignment mechanism for disks initially misaligned at $\mathcal{T}\lesssim 60^{\circ}$. Extremely misaligned MAD disks, on the other hand, exhibit intermittent jets that blow out parts of the disk to $\approx 100$ gravitational radii before collapsing, leaving behind hot cavities and magnetized filaments. These intermittent jet mechanism forms a mini-feedback cycle and could explain some cases of X-ray and radio quasi-periodic eruptions observed in dim AGN. Further, we find that (i) for BHs with low power jets, the BH spin and initial disk tilt angle changes the amount of horizon magnetic flux, and (ii) geometrically-thick, misaligned accretion flows do not undergo sustained Lense-Thirring (LT) precession. Thereby, we suggest that low-luminosity accreting BHs ($\dot{M}\ll 10^{-3} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$) are not likely to exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations in lightcurves due to LT precession, in agreement with observations of BH X-ray binaries and AGN in the low-hard/quiescent state. Instead, we suggest that magnetic flux eruptions can mimic precession-like motion, such as observed in the M87 jet, by driving large-scale surface waves in the jets.

  We present a multi-wavelength study of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in a sample of the 95 most massive galaxy clusters selected from South Pole Telescope (SPT) Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) survey. Our sample spans a redshift range of 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.7, and is complete with optical spectroscopy from various ground-based observatories, as well as ground and space-based imaging from optical, X-ray and radio wavebands. At z~0, previous studies have shown a strong correlation between the presence of a low-entropy cool core and the presence of star-formation and a radio-loud AGN in the central BCG. We show for the first time that a central entropy threshold for star formation persists out to z~1. The central entropy (measured in this work at a radius of 10 kpc) below which clusters harbor star-forming BCGs is found to be as low as $K_\mathrm{10 ~ kpc} = 35 \pm 4$ keV cm$^2$ at z &lt; 0.15 and as high as $K_\mathrm{10 ~ kpc} = 52 \pm 11$ keV cm$^2$ at z~1. We find only marginal (~1$\sigma$) evidence for evolution in this threshold. In contrast, we do not find a similar high-z analog for an entropy threshold for feedback, but instead measure a strong evolution in the fraction of radio-loud BCGs in high-entropy cores as a function of redshift. This could imply that the cooling-feedback loop was not as tight in the past, or that some other fuel source like mergers are fueling the radio sources more often with increasing redshift, making the radio luminosity an increasingly unreliable proxy for radio jet power. We also find that our SZ-based sample is missing a small (~4%) population of the most luminous radio sources ($\nu L_{\nu} &gt; 10^{42}$ erg/s), likely due to radio contamination suppressing the SZ signal with which these clusters are detected.

  We report a new, rare detection of HI 21-cm absorption associated with a quasar (only six known at $1&lt;z&lt;2$) here towards J2339-5523 at $z_{em}$ = 1.3531, discovered through the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS). The absorption profile is broad ($\sim 400$ km/s), and the peak is redshifted by $\sim 200$ km/s, from $z_{em}$. Interestingly, optical/FUV spectra of the quasar from Magellan-MIKE/HST-COS spectrographs do not show any absorption features associated with the 21-cm absorption. This is despite the coincident presence of the optical quasar and the radio `core' inferred from a flat spectrum component of flux density $\sim 65$ mJy at high frequencies ($&gt;5$ GHz). The simplest explanation would be that no large HI column (N(HI)$&gt;10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) is present towards the radio `core' and the optical AGN. Based on the joint optical and radio analysis of a heterogeneous sample of 16 quasars ($z_{median}$ = 0.7) and 15 radio galaxies ($z_{median}$ = 0.3) with HI 21-cm absorption detection and matched in 1.4 GHz luminosity (L$_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}$), a consistent picture emerges where quasars are primarily tracing the gas in the inner circumnuclear disk and cocoon created by the jet-ISM interaction. These exhibit L$_{1.4\,\rm GHz}$ - $\Delta V_{\rm null}$ correlation, and frequent mismatch between the radio and optical spectral lines. The radio galaxies show no such correlation and likely trace the gas from the cocoon and the galaxy-wide ISM outside the photoionization cone. The analysis presented here demonstrates the potential of radio spectroscopic observations to reveal the origin of the absorbing gas associated with AGN that may be missed in optical observations.   

Covering factor in AGNs: evolution versus selection

  In every proposed unification scheme for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), an integral element is the presence of circumnuclear dust arranged in torus-like structures. A crucial model parameter in this context is the covering factor (CF), defined as the ratio between the infrared luminosity of the dusty torus $L_{\rm IR}$, and the accretion disk bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm agn}$. Our study aims to determine whether CF evolution is genuine or if selection effects significantly influence it. Based on cross-matched multiwavelength photometrical data from the five major surveys (SDSS, GALEX, UKIDSS, WISE, SPITZER), a sample of almost 2,000 quasars was derived. The main parameters of quasars, such as black hole masses and the Eddington ratios, were calculated based on the spectroscopic data. The data were divided into two redshift bins: Low-$z$ (redshift ~1) and High-$z$ (redshift ~2) quasars.   We identified an issue with the accuracy of the WISE W4 filter. Whenever feasible, it is recommended to utilize SPITZER MIPS 24 $\mu$m data. The calculated median CF values for the highest quality SPITZER data are comparable within errors $\log$ CF$_{\textrm{low}-z} = -0.19\pm 0.11$ and $\log$ CF$_{\textrm{high}-z}= -0.18\pm 0.11$. The Efron &amp; Petrosian test confirmed the presence of luminosity evolution with redshift for both $L_{\rm IR}$ and $L_{\rm agn}$. Both the Low-$z$ and High-$z$ samples exhibit a similar correlation between $L_{\rm agn}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$. No discernible evolution of the CF was observed in the subsample of quasars with high SMBH mass bin or high luminosities. The relationship between $L_{\rm IR}$ and $L_{\rm agn}$ deviates slightly from the expected 1:1 scaling. However, no statistically significant dependence of CF on luminosities could be claimed across the entire dataset.

  We conduct a statistical study of black hole masses of barred and unbarred galaxies in the IllustrisTNG100 cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. This work aims to understand the role of the bars in the growth of central supermassive black hole mass and its implications on AGN fueling. Our sample consists of 1191 barred galaxies and 2738 unbarred galaxies in the IllustrisTNG100 simulations. To have an unbiased study, we perform our analysis with an equal number of barred and unbarred galaxies by using various controlled parameters like total galaxy mass, stellar mass, gas mass, dark matter halo mass, etc. Except for the stellar mass controlling, we find that the median of the black hole mass distribution for barred galaxies is higher than that of the unbarred ones indicating that stellar mass is a key parameter influencing the black hole growth. The higher mean accretion rate of the black holes in barred galaxies, averaged since the bar forming epoch (z~2 ), explains the higher mean black hole masses in barred galaxies. Further, we also test that these results are unaffected by other environmental processes like minor/major merger histories and neighboring gas density of black hole. Although the relationship between stellar mass, bar formation, and black hole growth is complex, with various mechanisms involved, our analysis suggests that bars can play a crucial role in feeding black holes, particularly in galaxies with massive stellar disks.
