  The Virgo cluster is the nearest massive galaxy cluster and thus a prime target to study astrophysical processes in dense large-scale environments. In the radio band, we can probe the non-thermal components of the inter-stellar medium (ISM), intracluster medium (ICM) and of active galactic nuclei (AGN). With the ViCTORIA (Virgo Cluster multi-Telescope Observations in Radio of Interacting galaxies and AGN) project, we are carrying out multiple wide-field surveys of the Virgo cluster at different frequencies. We aim to investigate the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies and the contribution of AGN to the ICM-heating, from the inner cluster regions out to beyond the virial radius. We present a survey of the cluster at 120-168 MHz using LOFAR. We image a 132 deg$^2$ region of the cluster, reaching an order of magnitude greater sensitivity than existing wide-field radio surveys of this field at three times higher spatial resolution compared to other low-frequency observations. We developed a tailored data processing strategy to subtract the bright central radio galaxy M87 from the data. This allowed us to correct for the systematic effects due to ionospheric variation as a function of time and direction. In the final mosaic with a resolution of 9"x5", we reach a median noise level of 140 ${\mu}$Jy/beam inside the virial radius and 280 ${\mu}$Jy/beam for the full area. We detect 112 Virgo member galaxies and 114 background galaxies. In at least 18 cases, the radio morphology of the cluster member galaxies shows clear signs of ram-pressure stripping. This includes three previously unreported candidates. In addition, we reveal for the first time 150 kpc long tails from a previous epoch of AGN activity for NGC 4472 (M 49). While no cluster-scale diffuse radio sources are discovered, we find the presence of an extended radio signature of the W$'$-group.

  Observations of ionized AGN outflows have provided compelling evidence that the radiation field transfers both momentum and energy to the plasma. At parsec scale distances in AGN, energy transfer can dominate, in which case the only force needed to launch an outflow is that from gas pressure. Much closer to the black hole, gravity dominates thermal energy due to insufficient heating by the radiation and the gas is in the so-called `cold' regime. Only magnetic or radiation forces can then lead to outflow, but it is unclear at what temperature and ionization state the radiation force weakens, as these properties depend on the spectral energy distribution (SED). In this work, we survey the parameter space of radiation forces due to spectral lines resulting from blackbody SEDs with varying temperatures in the range $\sim 10^4 - 10^6$~K to identify the radiation temperature at which line-driving begins to lose efficiency. We find that the temperature $\lesssim4\times10^5$~K marks the transition to inefficient line driving. We also self-consistently compute the heating and cooling balance to estimate the gas temperature, so that our parameter survey covers the transition where thermal driving goes from negligible to comparable to line driving. We summarize a large set of hydrodynamical simulations of radial flows to illustrate how the wind properties change during the transition and the dependence of these properties on the assumed SED and governing flow parameters.

  We introduce the Virgo Consortium's FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations for cosmology and galaxy cluster physics. To ensure the simulations are sufficiently realistic for studies of large-scale structure, the subgrid prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback are calibrated to the observed low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions. The calibration is performed using machine learning, separately for three resolutions. This approach enables specification of the model by the observables to which they are calibrated. The calibration accounts for a number of potential observational biases and for random errors in the observed stellar masses. The two most demanding simulations have box sizes of 1.0 and 2.8 Gpc and baryonic particle masses of $1\times10^8$ and $1\times10^9 \text{M}_\odot$, respectively. For the latter resolution the suite includes 12 model variations in a 1 Gpc box. There are 8 variations at fixed cosmology, including shifts in the stellar mass function and/or the cluster gas fractions to which we calibrate, and two alternative implementations of AGN feedback (thermal or jets). The remaining 4 variations use the unmodified calibration data but different cosmologies, including different neutrino masses. The 2.8 Gpc simulation follows $3\times10^{11}$ particles, making it the largest ever hydrodynamical simulation run to $z=0$. Lightcone output is produced on-the-fly for up to 8 different observers. We investigate numerical convergence, show that the simulations reproduce the calibration data, and compare with a number of galaxy, cluster, and large-scale structure observations, finding very good agreement with the data for converged predictions. Finally, by comparing hydrodynamical and `dark-matter-only' simulations, we confirm that baryonic effects can suppress the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum by up to $\approx20$ per cent.   

Outflow densities and ionisation mechanisms in the NLRs of the

  Despite being thought to play an important role in galaxy evolution, the true impact of outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) on their host galaxies is unclear. In part, this may be because electron densities of outflowing gas are often underestimated: recent studies that use alternative diagnostics have measured much higher densities than those from commonly used techniques, and consequently find modest outflow masses and kinetic powers. Furthermore, outflow ionisation mechanisms - which are often used to probe acceleration mechanisms - are also uncertain. To address these issues, we have analysed archival HST/STIS spectra of the inner regions (r&lt;160pc) of the nearby prototypical Seyfert galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 4151, which show evidence of warm-ionised outflows driven by the central AGN. We derive high electron densities ($10^{3.6}$&lt;$n_e$&lt;$10^{4.8}$cm$^{-3}$) using the transauroral [OII] and [SII] emission lines ratios for the first time with spatially-resolved observations. Moreover, we find evidence that the gas along the radio axis in NGC 1068 has a significant AGN-photoionised matter-bounded component, and there is evidence for shock-ionisation and/or radiation-bounded AGN-photoionisation along the radio axis in NGC 4151. We also note that the outflow extents are similar to those of the radio structures, consistent with acceleration by jet-induced shocks. Taken together, our investigation demonstrates the diversity of physical and ionisation conditions in the narrow line regions of Seyfert galaxies, and hence reinforces the need for robust diagnostics of outflowing gas densities and ionisation mechanisms.
