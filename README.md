  We re-examine the interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with photons from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) under a changed, locally non-linear temperature redshift relation $T(z)$. This changed temperature redshift relation is motivated by the postulate of subjecting thermalised and isotropic photon gases such as the CMB to an SU(2) rather than a U(1) gauge group. This modification of $\Lambda$CDM is called SU(2)$_{\rm CMB}$, and some cosmological parameters obtained by SU(2)$_{\rm CMB}$ seem to be in better agreement with local measurements of the same quantities. In this work, we apply the reduced CMB photon density under SU(2)$_{\rm CMB}$ to the propagation of UHECRs. This leads to a higher UHECR flux just below the ankle in the cosmic ray spectrum and slightly more cosmogenic neutrinos under otherwise equal conditions for emission and propagation. Most prominently, the proton flux is significantly increased below the ankle ($5\times10^{18}$ eV) for hard injection spectra and without considering the effects of magnetic fields. The reduction in CMB photon density also favours a decreased cosmic ray source evolution than the best fit using $\Lambda$CDM. In consequence, it seems that SU(2)$_{\rm CMB}$ favours sources that evolve as the star formation rate (SFR), like star burst galaxies (SBG) and gamma ray bursts (GRB), over active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as origins of UHECRs. We conclude that the question about the nature of primary sources of UHECRs is tightly-knit with the actual temperature redshift relation of the CMB.

  Jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the principal extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources. Fermi-detected high-redshift ($z&gt;3$) blazars are jetted AGNs thought to be powered by massive, rapidly spinning supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe ($&lt;2$ Gyr). They provide a laboratory to study early black hole (BH) growth and super-Eddington accretion -- possibly responsible for the more rapid formation of jetted BHs. However, previous virial BH masses of $z&gt;3$ blazars were based on C IV in the observed optical, but C IV is known to be biased by strong outflows. We present new Gemini/GNIRS near-IR spectroscopy for a sample of nine $z&gt;3$ Fermi $\gamma$-ray blazars with available multi-wavelength observations that maximally sample the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We estimate virial BH masses based on the better calibrated broad H$\beta$ and/or Mg II . We compare the new virial BH masses against independent mass estimates from SED modeling. Our work represents the first step in campaigning for more robust virial BH masses and Eddington ratios for high-redshift Fermi blazars. Our new results confirm that high-redshift Fermi blazars indeed host overly massive SMBHs as suggested by previous work, which may pose a theoretical challenge for models of the rapid early growth of jetted SMBHs.

  Optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are the most preferred signs of sub-pc binary black hole (BBH) systems in AGN. In this manuscript, robust optical QPOs are reported in quasar SDSS J1609+1756 at $z=0.347$. In order to detect reliable optical QPOs, four different methods are applied to analyze the 4.45 years-long ZTF g/r/i-band light curves of SDSS J1609+1756, direct fitting results by sine function, Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Auto-Cross Correlation Function and Weighted Wavelet Z-transform method. The Four different methods can lead to well determined reliable optical QPOs with periodicities $\sim340$ days with confidence levels higher than 5$\sigma$, to guarantee the robustness of the optical QPOs in SDSS J1609+1756. Meanwhile, based on simulated light curves through CAR process to trace intrinsic AGN activities, confidence level higher than $3\sigma$ can be confirmed that the optical QPOs are not mis-detected in intrinsic AGN activities, re-confirming the robust optical QPOs and strongly indicating a central sub-pc BBH system in SDSS J1609+1756. Furthermore, based on apparent red-shifted shoulders in broad Balmer emission lines in SDSS J1609+1756, space separation of the expected central BBH system can be estimated to be smaller than $107\pm60$ light-days, accepted upper limit of total BH mass $\sim(1.03\pm0.22)\times10^8{\rm M_\odot}$. Therefore, to detect and report BBH system expected optical QPOs with periodicities around 1 year is efficiently practicable through ZTF light curves, and combining with peculiar broad line emission features, further clues should be given on space separations of BBH systems in broad line AGN in the near future.

  Supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to launch relativistic jets, which are observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum and are thought to be efficient particle accelerators. Their primary radiation mechanism for radio emission is polarized synchrotron emission produced by a population of non-thermal electrons. In this Letter, we present a global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulation of a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). After the simulation reaches the MAD state, we show that waves are continuously launched and propagate along the shear layer, where they shear magnetic field lines and alter the shear layer geometry. We then perform polarized radiation transfer calculations of our GRMHD simulation and find signatures of the waves in both total intensity and linear polarization, effectively lowering the fully resolved polarization fraction. The tell-tale polarization signatures of the waves could be observable by future Very Long Baseline Interferometric observations, e.g., by the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope.
