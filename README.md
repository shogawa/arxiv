  Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that emit non-thermal radiation through relativistic jets, characterized by rapid flux and polarization variability. Extreme high synchrotron-peaked blazars (EHSPs), with synchrotron peaks exceeding 10$^{17}$ Hz, are essential for understanding the full range of blazar phenomena and testing jet physics models. However, the number of known extreme blazars is small, so this class of objects remains poorly studied. This work aims to systematically identify and characterize the most extreme $\gamma$-ray blazars using data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The focus is on spectral hardening, where the $\gamma$-ray spectrum becomes harder at higher energies, particularly during flaring episodes. This represents the first dedicated analysis of spectral hardening across a population of EHSPs, as previous studies explored it only in individual sources. We analyze 138 blazars selected from the 4FGL-DR2 catalog with high synchrotron peak frequencies and well-sampled light curves. Flaring periods are automatically identified, and each flare is analyzed, with the significance of spectral hardening assessed through a test statistic based on the likelihood ratio of two spectral models. We identify two flaring episodes with indications of spectral hardening, in 4FGL J0238.4$-$3116 and PKS 2155$-$304, the latter detected independently by both methods but referring to the same period. These events are consistent with expectations from statistical fluctuations, suggesting that spectral hardening is a rare occurrence (&lt; 0.1 %). These results constrain its frequency and support a smoothly varying power-law blazar emission model, motivating future multi-wavelength studies to clarify whether these rare flares reflect distinct physical processes within blazar jets.

  Spherically symmetric accretion incorporating self-gravity constitutes a three-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) governed by constraints at the outer boundary, sonic point, and accretor surface. Previous studies have two limitations: either employing an incorrect formula for self-gravity potential in analytical treatments, or introducing additional input parameters in numerical implementations to circumvent solving the full TPBVP. To address these issues, we present a self-consistent TPBVP formulation, solved using the relaxation method. We also derive approximate analytical formulae that enable rapid estimates of self-gravity effects. Our analysis identifies a dimensionless parameter $\beta \equiv 2G \bar{\rho} r_\mathrm{out}^2/a_\mathrm{out}^2$ that characterizes the strength of self-gravity, where $\bar{\rho}$ and $r_\mathrm{out}$ are the mean density and outer radius of the flow, respectively, and $a_\mathrm{out}$ is the adiabatic sound speed of the external medium. For practical estimation, $\bar{\rho}$ may be approximated by the external medium density $\rho_\mathrm{out}$. We identify an upper limit for $\beta$, beyond which steady accretion becomes unsustainable -- a behavior consistent with classical gravitational instability that previous studies failed to capture. The accretion rate enhancement decreases monotonically as the adiabatic index $\gamma$ increases. For $\gamma=5/3$, self-gravity ceases to augment the accretion rate. These theoretical predictions are validated by our numerical solutions. We further apply our results to two astrophysical scenarios: hyper-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black hole seeds in the early Universe, where self-gravity is significant; and accretion onto stellar-mass objects embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, where self-gravity is non-negligible under certain conditions and should be evaluated using $\beta$.

  The accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are widely considered the ideal environments for binary black hole (BBH) mergers and the only plausible sites for their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. Graham et al.(2023) identified seven AGN flares that are potentially associated with gravitational-wave (GW) events detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration during the third observing run. In this article, utilizing an additional three years of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public data after their discovery, we conduct an updated analysis and find that only three flares can be identified. By implementing a joint analysis of optical and GW data through a Bayesian framework, we find two flares exhibit a strong correlation with GW events, with no secondary flares observed in their host AGN up to 2024 October 31. Combining these two most robust associations, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_{0}= 72.1^{+23.9}_{-23.1} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and incorporating the multi-messenger event GW170817 improves the precision to $H_{0}=73.5^{+9.8}_{-6.9} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. Both results are consistent with existing measurements reported in the literature.

  The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way interstellar medium. However, we also show that the high-energy neutrinos co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with IceCube-Gen2.

  NGC 4527 is a nearby edge-on spiral galaxy with both starburst and AGN features, hosting a LINER nucleus. We present a radio study of the large-scale structure and nuclear region of this galaxy, based on new uGMRT observations at 700 and 1230 MHz. Our continuum maps reveal extended emission tracing the stellar disk, with no evidence of a radio halo. The spectral index distribution and the presence of PAHs across the disk are consistent with ongoing star formation. In the nuclear region we resolve three compact sources: one at the galactic centre and two symmetrically aligned with the major axis at $\sim400$ pc. The spectral index values and the destruction of PAHs in the central source, together with previously detected X-rays emission, suggest the presence of a low-luminosity AGN. The two off-centre sources are consistent with a star formation ring, coincident with a molecular gas ring previously reported. We explore a scenario where super-Eddington accretion onto the black hole drives a dense wind that falls back onto the disk, triggering star formation in a circumnuclear ring.

  The vast amount of energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGN) is increasingly recognized as a key driver of evolution not only in massive galaxies and clusters, but also in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Despite this, their role in the early stages of galaxy formation and in self-regulating the rapid growth of the first and abundant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains poorly understood. Through new high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations, we follow the co-evolution of $10^5 M_\odot$ black hole seeds with their host galaxy. The simulated suite progressively spans physics ranging from no AGN feedback and Eddington-limited thermal feedback, to more complex setups including non-Eddington-limited thermal, kinetic and radiative feedback. Across all our models, we find that black hole seeds efficiently reach masses of $\sim10^7 M_\odot$ by z=8. Although they exhibit notably different mass growth histories, these latter seem unimpeded by the presence of AGN feedback. The simulation including radiative feedback is the most distinct, with super-Eddington episodes driving fast and mass-loaded gas outflows (exceeding 2500 km $s^{-1}$) up to $\sim$50 kpc, along with minor stellar mass suppression in the host galaxy. Our measurements are in broad agreement with moderate luminosity quasars recently observed by JWST, producing overmassive black holes, dynamical masses of $\sim10^{9.5} M_\odot$, and high, though short-lived, Eddington fraction accretion rates. These results advocate for a scenario where AGN feedback allows for rapid SMBH growth during the reionisation era, while driving winds that extend deep into the intergalactic medium - shaping host galaxies as well as more distant surroundings.
