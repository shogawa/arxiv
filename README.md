  AT2019qiz is the first standard optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with detection of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), providing strong evidence for TDE-QPE association. Moreover, it belongs to the rare subset of optical TDEs with prominent infrared (IR) echoes revealed by the multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The IR light curve shows an early bump, followed by a steady rise until the second-to-last epoch, after which it appears to enter a plateau phase. The dust temperature decreased until the fourth epoch and remains approximately constant for the subsequent five epochs. We have fitted the last five epochs using a convex dust ring model, resulting in an inner radius $&gt;1.2$ pc. Such a large radius greatly exceeds the inner radius of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus for a $10^6\,M_{\odot}$ black hole and thus could be a torus remnant with the inner part having vanished, further supporting the unified scenario of recently faded AGNs, TDEs, and QPEs. Consequently, a connection between QPEs and IR-bright TDEs is naturally expected. Moreover, the echo requires at least a peak bolometric luminosity of $(6.6, 9.5, 1.0)\times 44 \,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ assuming silicate, silicon carbide, and graphite dust grains, respectively, all of which are significantly higher than the peak optical blackbody luminosity. It adds to the accumulating evidence that the missing energy of TDEs may lie in the unobservable extreme UV. This work highlights the unique value of IR echoes in the study of TDEs and QPEs, and a promising prospect in the era of the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, the successor to WISE.

  Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a powerful tool for probing the structure of the innermost accretion flow and corona around supermassive black holes. RE~J1034+396, the most prominent AGN known to host an X-ray QPO, exhibits both short-term and long-term QPO evolution, offering a unique opportunity to investigate accretion disk and corona physics through its temporal behavior. We report a possible long-term ($\sim 92.2$ days) cyclic evolution of the QPO in RE~J1034+396, joining the detected QPO ($\sim 3730$ s) and its short-term ($\sim 17$ ks) modulation to form a possible QPO triplet, which is potentially the first such structure identified in an AGN. By applying the relativistic precession model to the QPO triplet, we constrain the black hole mass to $1.7^{+0.9}_{-0.8} \times 10^{6}\ M_\odot$, consistent with independent estimates, and find a low dimensionless black hole spin of $0.017^{+0.028}_{-0.012}$. We propose an exploratory model that involves a quasiperiodic ultra-fast outflow (UFO) within the framework of the relativistic precession model, explaining the QPO lag reversal, the modulation of hard-band QPO amplitude by soft-band flux, and the long-term evolution of timing properties. Supporting evidence includes blueshifted emission and absorption lines indicating a strong UFO at $\sim 0.3c$. This work provides new insights into the inner regions of AGN accretion disks and motivates further efforts in both numerical modeling and high-cadence timing observations.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as ''Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free $10^6 \, M_\odot$ SMS. We establish that its luminosity ($L_\lambda \approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \mu\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the extreme, V-shaped Balmer break is an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$\beta$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) emit radiation via accretion across the entire energy spectrum. While the standard disk and corona model can somewhat describe this emission, it fails to predict specific features such as the soft X-ray excess, the short-term optical/UV variability, and the observed UV/X-ray correlation in AGN. In this context, the fraction of AGN emission in different bands (i.e., bolometric corrections) can be useful to better understand the accretion physics of AGN. Past studies have shown that the X-ray bolometric corrections are strongly dependent on the physical properties of AGN, such as their luminosities and Eddington ratios. However, since these two parameters depend on each other, it has been unclear which is the main driver of the X-ray bolometric corrections. We present here results from a large study of hard X-ray-selected (14-195 keV) nearby ($z&lt;0.1$) AGN. Based on our systematic analysis of the simultaneous optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions of 236 unobscured AGN, we found that the primary parameter controlling the X-ray bolometric corrections is the Eddington ratio. Our results show that while the X-ray bolometric correction increases with the bolometric luminosity for sources with intermediate Eddington ratios ($0.01-1$), this dependence vanishes for sources with lower Eddington ratios ($&lt;0.01$). This could be used as evidence for a change in the accretion physics of AGN at low Eddington ratios.

  We characterize the magnetic field properties of 352 massive galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation with a focus on central magnetic field morphology in cool-core (CC) vs non-cool-core (NCC) clusters. We present the central values and radial profiles of magnetic field strength and plasma parameter as a function of mass, cooling status and redshift. Compared to low-redshift observations, TNG-Cluster produces reasonable magnetic field amplitudes in the central regions of clusters spanning a range of 1-200 muG. We then discuss the main finding of this work: z=0 cool-core clusters have preferentially tangential magnetic fields at a characteristic scale of ~ 0.1 r500c. These strongly tangential field orientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster population, magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and redshifts. As individual halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field topologies is diverse: tangential features can be short-lived, persist over large cosmological time-scales, or periodically appear, vanish, and reappear towards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and possible physical scenarios to explain the origin of these structures. We argue that both AGN feedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot explain the population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation. Instead, we propose that the trapping of internal gravity waves is responsible for the tangentially biased magnetic field topologies that we find in cool-core TNG-Cluster halos, due to the strong entropy gradient in these clusters.
