  Binaries in dense environments are traditionally classified as soft or hard based on their binding energy relative to the kinetic energy of surrounding stars. Heggie's law suggests that stellar encounters tend to soften soft binaries and harden hard binaries, altering their separations. However, interactions with gas in such environments can significantly modify this behavior. This study investigates the impact of gas on binary softening and its consequences. We find that gas interactions can actually harden binaries, extending the soft-hard boundary to larger separations. This introduces a "shielding radius" within which binaries are likely to harden due to gas interactions, surpassing the traditional soft-hard limit. Consequently, a notable portion of binaries initially classified as "soft" may become "hard" when both gas and stars are considered. We propose a two-stage formation process for hard binaries: initial soft binary formation, either dynamically or through gas-assisted capture, followed by gas-induced hardening before eventual disruption. In environments with low gas density but high gas content, the shielding radius could exceed the typical hard-soft limit by an order of magnitude, leading to a significant fraction of originally soft binaries effectively becoming hard. Conversely, in high gas-density environments, gas-induced hardening may dominate, potentially rendering the entire binary population hard. Gas hardening emerges as a crucial factor in shaping binary populations in gas-rich settings, such as clusters, star-forming regions, and possibly AGN disks. This highlights the complex interplay between gas dynamics and stellar interactions in binary evolution within dense environments.   

Kicking time back in black-hole mergers: Ancestral masses, spins, birth

  Pair-instability supernova (PISN) is thought to prevent the formation of black holes from stellar collapse within the approximate mass range $M\in [65,130]M_\odot$. However, such black holes may form through hierarchical formation channels, as the result of merging "ancestor" black holes, whose properties determine those of the ``child'' black hole, namely its mass, spin, and recoil velocity (or kick). Crucially, the child black hole will be expelled from its host environment if its "birth kick" exceeds the corresponding escape velocity, preventing it from undergoing further mergers. In this work, we exploit tight relations between the final kick and final spin of quasi-circular black-hole mergers to obtain posterior probability distributions for the hypothetical ancestral masses, spins and birth kicks of the component black holes of GW190521, assuming both quasi-circular (with generic spins) eccentric (aligned-spin) scenarios for the latter. With this, we evaluate the probability $p_{2g}$ that the GW190521 components formed from the merger of stellar-origin black holes, being retained by the host environment. For the primary component BH1, which falls squarely in the PISN mass gap, we find that such scenario is strongly suppressed if GW190521 happened in a Globular Cluster, unless GW190521 was quasi-circular and BH1 had aligned-spin ancestors, characteristic of isolated black-hole binary formation scenarios. Similarly, for denser host environments (excluding AGNs), we only obtain probabilities $p_{2g} &gt; 0.5$ if GW190521 was quasi-circular and BH1 had aligned-spin ancestors. If GW190521 was eccentric, we find maximal values $p_{2g}$ of only $p_{2g} \simeq 0.1$ which require ancestral mass ratios $q\geq 2$, untypical of isolated formation scenarios. Our results seem consistent with an AGN origin for GW190521, especially if this was eccentric.

  The growth of supermassive black holes is strongly linked to their galaxies. It has been shown that the population mean black-hole accretion rate ($\overline{\mathrm{BHAR}}$) primarily correlates with the galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) and redshift for the general galaxy population. This work aims to provide the best measurements of $\overline{\mathrm{BHAR}}$ as a function of $M_\star$ and redshift over ranges of $10^{9.5}&lt;M_\star&lt;10^{12}~M_\odot$ and $z&lt;4$. We compile an unprecedentedly large sample with eight thousand active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and 1.3 million normal galaxies from nine high-quality survey fields following a wedding-cake design. We further develop a semiparametric Bayesian method that can reasonably estimate $\overline{\mathrm{BHAR}}$ and the corresponding uncertainties, even for sparsely populated regions in the parameter space. $\overline{\mathrm{BHAR}}$ is constrained by X-ray surveys sampling the AGN accretion power and UV-to-infrared multi-wavelength surveys sampling the galaxy population. Our results can independently predict the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) from the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF), and the prediction is consistent with the observed XLF. We also try adding external constraints from the observed SMF and XLF. We further measure $\overline{\mathrm{BHAR}}$ for star-forming and quiescent galaxies and show that star-forming $\overline{\mathrm{BHAR}}$ is generally larger than or at least comparable to the quiescent $\overline{\mathrm{BHAR}}$.
