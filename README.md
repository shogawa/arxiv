  Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit variability across a wide range of time scales. Traditionally, this variability can often be modeled well as a stochastic process. However, in certain cases, jetted AGN variability displays regular patterns, enabling us to conduct investigations aimed at understanding its origins. Additionally, a novel type of variability has emerged in jetted AGN lightcurves, specifically, the observation of a long-term trend characterized by a linear increase of the flux with time in blazars such as PG 1553+113, which is among the objects most likely to display periodic behavior. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for long-term trends, spanning $\approx$10\, years, utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations. The study is focused on detecting the presence of linear or quadratic long-term trends in a sample of 3308 jetted AGN. Our analysis has identified 40 jetted AGN that exhibit long-term trends, each with distinct properties, which we also characterize in this study. These long-term trends may originate from the dynamics of a supermassive black hole binary system, or they could be the result of intrinsic phenomena within the jet itself. Our findings can help in addressing questions pertaining to the astrophysical origins of variability and periodicity within jetted AGN.

  We study the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day Green Valley (GV) galaxies across redshift $z=10-0$ using data from the EAGLE simulations. We identify the present-day green valley galaxies using entropic thresholding and track the evolution of the physical properties of their progenitors up to $z=10$. Our study identifies three distinct phases in their evolution: (i) an early growth phase ($z=10-6$), where progenitors are gas-rich, efficiently form stars, and experience AGN feedback regulating star formation in massive galaxies, (ii) a transition phase ($z=6-2$), marked by frequent interactions and mergers in higher-density environments, driving starbursts, depleting gas reservoirs, and strengthening correlations between cold gas and halo properties, and (iii) a quenching phase ($z=2-0$), dominated by environmental and mass-dependent processes that suppress star formation and deplete cold gas. Our analysis shows that at $z&lt;1$, environmental factors and cold gas depletion dominate quenching, with tighter correlations between stellar mass, SFR, and cold gas content. The interplay between mass and environmental density during this period drives diverse and distinct evolutionary pathways. Low-mass progenitors evolve gradually in low-density regions due to secular processes and slow gas depletion, while those in high-density environments quench rapidly via environmental mechanisms. High-mass progenitors in low-density environments exhibit prolonged green valley phases driven by internal processes. In contrast, those in dense environments undergo quenching more quickly due to the combined effects of internal and external processes. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the mechanisms shaping the GV population across cosmic time.

  3C 216 is an extra-galactic radio source classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) object, associated with the source 4FGL J0910.0+4257 detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The source exhibits extended radio structures as well as an inner relativistic jet. In general, jets accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are efficient sources of non-thermal radiation, spanning from the radio band to X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Due to relativistic beaming, much of this radiation, particularly in the high-energy domain, is concentrated within a narrow cone aligned with the jet's direction. Consequently, high-energy emission is more easily detected in blazars, where the jet is closely aligned with the line of sight of the observer. Beginning in November 2022, Fermi-LAT observed increased gamma-ray activity from 3C 216, culminating in a strong outburst in May 2023. This event was followed up by observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory telescope. In this work, we perform a careful analysis of the multifrequency data (gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical) collected during this observational campaign. We find that the spectral energy distribution of the flaring source evolves in a coherent way, suggesting a common origin for the multifrequency emission. These results support the interpretation of the gamma-ray emission within a single zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, with important implications for the mechanisms powering high-energy radiation in AGN jets.

  The changing-look blazars (CLBs) are the blazars that their optical spectral lines at different epochs show a significant changes and present a clear transition between the standard FSRQ and BL Lac types. The changing-look phenomena in blazars are highly significant for enhancing our understanding of certain physical problems of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), such as the potential mechanism of the state transition in the accretion process of the supermassive black holes in the central engine of AGNs, the possible intrinsic variation of the jet, and the connection between the accretion disk and the jet. Currently, the CLBs reported in the literature are still rare astronomical objects. In our previous work, we found that there are 8 physical properties parameters of CLBs located between those of FSRQs and those of BL Lacs. In order to search more CLB candidates (CLBCs), we employed the $mclust$ Gaussian Mixture Modelling clustering algorithm to perform clustering analysis for the 255 subsets of the 8 physical properties parameters with 2250 blazars from the 4FGL-DR3. We find that there are 29 subsets with 3 groups (corresponding to bl lacs, fsrqs, and CLBCs), in which there are 4 subsets with the adjusted Rand index greater then 0.610 (ARI $&gt;$ 0.610). The combined clustering results from 4 subsets report that there are 111 CLBCs that includes 44 CLBs reported in previous literature and 67 new CLBCs, where 11 CLBCs labeled as BL Lac and 56 CLBCs labeled as FSRQ in 4FGL catalog.
