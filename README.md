  We investigate the nature of low-luminosity radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGN) selected from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) first data release (DR1). Using optical, mid-infrared, and radio data, we have conservatively selected 55 radiative AGN candidates from DR1 within the redshift range $0.03&lt;z&lt;0.1$. We show using high-frequency {\it Karl G. Jansky} Very Large Array (VLA) observations that 10 out of 55 objects show radio emission on scales $&gt;$$1-3$ kpc, 42 are compact at the limiting resolution of 0.35 arcsec (taking an upper limit on the projected physical size, this corresponds to less than 1 kpc), and three are undetected. The extended objects display a wide range of radio morphologies: two-jet (5), one-jet (4), and double-lobed (1). We present the radio spectra of all detected radio sources which range from steep to flat/inverted and span the range seen for other compact radio sources such as compact symmetric objects (CSOs), compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources, and gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) sources. Assuming synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) for flat/inverted radio spectrum sources, we predict small physical sizes for compact objects to range between $2-53$ pc. Alternatively, using free-free absorption (FFA) models, we have estimated the free electron column depth for all compact objects, assuming a homogeneous absorber. We find that these objects do not occupy a special position on the power/linear size ($P-D$) diagram but some share a region with radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and so-called `FR0' sources in terms of radio luminosity and linear size.

  We report on the finding of a newborn AGN, i.e. current AGN activity in a galaxy previously classified as non-active, and characterize its evolution. Black hole ignition event candidates were selected from a parent sample of spectrally classified non-active galaxies (2.394.312 objects), that currently show optical flux variability indicative of a type I AGN, according to the ALeRCE light curve classifier. A second epoch spectrum for a sample of candidate newborn AGN were obtained with the SOAR telescope to search for new AGN features. We present spectral results for the most convincing case of new AGN activity, for a galaxy with a previous star-forming optical classification, where the second epoch spectrum shows the appearance of prominent, broad Balmer lines without significant changes in the narrow line flux ratios. Long term optical lightcurves show a steady increase in luminosity starting 1.5 years after the SDSS spectrum was taken and continuing for at least 7 years. MIR colors from the WISE catalog have also evolved from typical non active galaxy colors to AGN-like colors and recent X-ray flux detections confirm its AGN nature.

  We discuss recent results in neutrino astronomy and their implications for the cosmic-ray acceleration in relativistic outflows, such as in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) jets, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs). We especially focus on challenges at the interface to particle acceleration which can be inferred from the multi-messenger context, such as the paradigm that the sources power the Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). We demonstrate that both AGN blazars (in the context of neutrino observations) and GRBs (as UHECR sources in the context of neutrino-non-observations) point towards acceleration spectra harder than $E^{-2}$, or relatively high minimal cosmic-ray injection energies, to meet the respective energy budget requirements. We furthermore speculate that neutrino flares in AGN blazars may be related to super-Eddington accretion flares, or that GRBs are powered by significantly higher kinetic energies than typically assumed in electromagnetic models. For internal shock models, the UHECR paradigm for GRBs can only be maintained in the light of neutrino stacking limits in multi-zone models. While relativistic outflows in TDEs have become recently interesting per se and models for the neutrino emission from jetted TDEs exist, a direct connection between TDE jets pointing in our direction and astrophysical neutrinos has not been identified yet.

  Aims. The X-ray luminous and radio-loud AGN SRGE J170245.3+130104 discovered at z $\sim$ 5.5 provides unique chances to probe the SMBH growth and evolution with powerful jets in the early Universe. Methods. We present 1.35 - 5.1 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) results on the radio continuum emission and spectrum analysis for this quasar in a low flux density state. Results. This source is unresolved at three frequencies with the total flux densities of 8.35$\pm$0.09 mJy beam-1, 7.47$\pm$0.08 mJy beam-1, and 6.57$\pm$0.02 mJy beam-1 at 1.73 GHz, 2.26 GHz, and 4.87 GHz, respectively. Meanwhile, the brightness temperature is higher than 109 K. Conclusions. Compared with previous radio observations with arcsec-scale resolution, nearly all the radio emission from this source concentrates in the very central milli-arcsecond (mas) scale area. We confirm this source is a bright blazar at z &gt; 5. This young AGN provide us the great chances to understand the first generation of strong jets in the early Universe.

  Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes with estimated masses of $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim7-9$. Some reside in overmassive systems with higher AGN to stellar mass ratios than locally. Understanding how massive black holes could form so early in cosmic history and affect their environment to establish the observed relations today are some of the major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology. One model to create these massive objects is through direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) that provide massive seeds ($\sim10^5-10^6$ M$_\odot$), able to reach high masses in the limited time available. We use the cosmological simulation code GIZMO to study the formation and growth of DCBH seeds in the early Universe. To grow the DCBHs, we implement a gas swallowing model that is set to match the Eddington accretion rate as long as the nearby gaseous environment, affected by stellar and accretion disk feedback, provides sufficient fuel. We find that to create massive AGN in overmassive systems at high redshifts, massive seeds accreting more efficiently than the fiducial Bondi-Hoyle model are needed. We assess whether the conditions for such enhanced accretion rates are realistic by considering limits on plausible transport mechanisms. We also examine various DCBH growth histories and find that mass growth is more sustained in overdense cosmological environments, where high gas densities are achieved locally. We discuss the exciting prospect to directly probe the assembly history of the first SMBHs with upcoming, ultra-deep JWST surveys.
