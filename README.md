  Recent studies suggest that high-energy neutrinos can be produced in the jets of blazars, radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets pointing close to the line of sight. Due to the relatively poor angular resolution of current neutrino detectors, several sources can be regarded as the possible counterpart of a given neutrino event. Therefore, follow-up observations of counterpart candidates in the electromagnetic regime are essential. Since the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique provides the highest angular resolution to study the radio jets of blazars, a growing number of investigations are being conducted to connect individual blazars to given high-energy neutrino events. We analyzed more than 20 years of available archival VLBI data of the blazar CTD 74, which has been listed as a possible counterpart of a neutrino event. Using cm-wavelength data, we investigated the jet structure, determined the apparent speed of jet components, and the core flux density before and after the neutrino event. Our results indicate stationary jet features and a significant brightening of the core after the neutrino event.

  The innermost regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are critical for understanding galaxy evolution and the dynamics of matter near a Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH). Yet, due to smaller angular projections, it is very difficult to resolve these regions. This thesis explores indirect methods to understand these objects. We use the reverberation mapping technique to estimate accretion disk sizes for a sample of AGN, finding that the computed disk sizes are, on average, 3.9 times larger than the Shakura Sunyev (SS) standard disk model predictions. We also find a weak correlation between the obtained accretion disk sizes and the SMBH mass. We present initial results from a new accretion disk monitoring program to probe the accretion disk structure of Super Eddington Accreting AGN. We report that the disk sizes are about 4 times larger than the SS disk model. We calibrate the narrow-band photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) technique to develop tools for a large systematic narrow-band PRM project. We use simulations to test the effect of cadence, variability of the light curves, and the length of light curves in recovering the reverberation lags. We study the dichotomy between AGNs with and without detected jets using the method of microvariability observed in the accretion disk continuum. We find that AGNs with confirmed jets are about 3 times more variable on short time scales than the AGNs without a confirmed jet. By performing statistical analysis on a large sample of low luminosity AGNs, we find that the NLSy1 galaxies are more likely to have outflow signatures than their broad-line counterparts, hinting toward the disk wind origin of the material in BLR. We find that the principal components for NLSy1 galaxies differ from the BLSy1 galaxies, suggesting that the NLSy1 galaxies could be occupying their own parameter space.

  Some high-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are found to reside in extreme star-forming galaxies, such as hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs), with AGN-removed $L_{\rm{IR}}$ of $&gt;10^{13} L_{\rm{\odot}}$. In this paper, we report NOEMA observations of six apparent starburst HyLIRGs associated with optical quasars at $z\sim2-3$ in the Stripe 82 field, to study their dust and molecular CO properties. Five out of the six candidates are detected with CO(4-3) or CO(5-4) emission, and four in 2mm dust continuum. Based on the linewidth-$L'_{\rm{CO(1-0)}}$ diagnostics, we find that four galaxies are likely unlensed or weakly lensed sources. The molecular gas mass is in the range of $\mu M_{\rm{H_2}} \sim0.8-9.7\times10^{10} M_{\odot}$ (with $\alpha = 0.8 M_{\odot} (\rm{K km s^{-1} pc^2})^{-1}$ and $\mu$ is the unknown possible gravitational magnification factor). We fit their SEDs, after including the observed 2mm fluxes and upper limits, and estimate their apparent (uncorrected for possible lensing effect) star formation rates ($\mu$SFRs) to be $\sim400-2500$ $M_{\rm{\odot}} \rm{yr^{-1}}$ with depletion time of $\sim20-110$ Myr. We notice interesting offsets, of $\sim10-40$ kpc spatially or $\sim1000-2000$ km s$^{-1}$ spectroscopically, between the optical quasar and the mm continuum or CO emissions. The observed velocity shift is likely related to the blueshifted broad-emission-line region of quasars, though mergers or recoiling black holes are also possible causes, which can explain the spatial offset and the high intrinsic SFRs in the HyLIRG-quasar systems.

  The first "seeds" of supermassive black holes (BH) can range from $\sim10^2-10^6~M_{\odot}$. However, the lowest mass seeds ($\lesssim10^3 M_{\odot}$) are inaccessible to most cosmological simulations due to resolution limitations. We present our new BRAHMA suite of cosmological simulations that uses a novel flexible seeding approach to represent low mass seeds. Our suite consists of two types of boxes that model $\sim10^3~M_{\odot}$ seeds using two distinct but mutually consistent seeding prescriptions at different simulation resolutions. First, we have the highest resolution $[9~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ (BRAHMA-9-D3) boxes that directly resolve $\sim10^3~M_{\odot}$ seeds and place them within halos with dense and metal poor gas. Second, we have lower-resolution and larger-volume $[18~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ (BRAHMA-18-E4) and $\sim[36~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ (BRAHMA-36-E5) boxes that seed their smallest resolvable $\sim10^4~\&amp;~10^5~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ BH descendants using new stochastic seeding prescriptions calibrated using the BRAHMA-9-D3 results. The three boxes together probe BHs between $\sim10^3-10^7 M_{\odot}$ at $z&gt;7$ and we predict their key observables. The variation in the AGN luminosity functions is small (factors of $\sim2-3$) at the anticipated detection limits of potential future X-ray facilities ($\sim10^{43} \mathrm{ergs~s^{-1}}$ at $z\sim7$). Our simulations predict BHs $\sim10-100$ times heavier than expectations from local $M_*$ vs $M_{bh}$ relations, consistent with several JWST-detected AGN. For different seed models, our simulations merge BH binaries at $\sim1-15~\mathrm{kpc}$, with rates of $\sim200-2000$ per year for $\gtrsim10^3 M_{\odot}$ BHs, $\sim6-60$ per year for $\gtrsim10^4~M_{\odot}$ BHs, and up to $\sim10$ per year amongst $\gtrsim10^5 M_{\odot}$ BHs. These results suggest that the LISA mission has promising prospects for constraining seed models.   

Multiphase gas in elliptical galaxies: the role of Type Ia supernovae

  Massive elliptical galaxies harbor large amounts of hot gas ($T\gtrsim10^6~\mathrm{K}$) in their interstellar medium (ISM) but are typically quiescent in star formation. Active-galactic nuclei (AGNs) jets and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) inject energy into the ISM which offsets its radiative losses and keeps it hot. SNIa deposit their energy locally within the galaxy compared to the larger few$\times10~\mathrm{kpc}$-scale AGN jets. In this study, we perform high-resolution ($512^3$) hydrodynamic simulations of a local ($1~\mathrm{kpc}^3$) density-stratified patch of massive galaxies' ISM. We include radiative cooling and shell-averaged volume heating, as well as randomly exploding SNIa. We study the effect of different fractions of supernova heating (with respect to the net cooling rate), different initial ISM density/entropy (which controls the thermal-instability growth time $t_\mathrm{ti}$) and different degrees of stratification (which affects the free-fall time $t_\mathrm{ff}$). We find that the SNIa drive predominantly compressive turbulence in the ISM with a velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ up to $40~\mathrm{km}s^{-1}$ and logarithmic density dispersion $\sigma_s\sim0.2$--$0.4$. These fluctuations trigger multiphase condensation in regions of the ISM where $\min(t_\mathrm{ti})/t_\mathrm{ff}\lesssim 0.6\exp(6 \sigma_s)$, in agreement with theoretical expectations that large density fluctuations efficiently trigger multiphase gas formation. Since the SNIa rate is not self-adjusting, when the net cooling drops below the net heating rate the SNIa drive a hot wind which sweeps out most of the mass in our local model. Global simulations are required to assess the ultimate fate of this gas.

  In anticipation of the Euclid Wide and Deep Surveys, we present optical emission-line predictions at intermediate redshifts from 0.4 to 2.5. Our approach combines a mock light cone from the GAEA semi-analytic model to self-consistently model nebular emission from HII regions, narrow-line regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and evolved stellar populations. Our analysis focuses on seven optical emission lines: H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [SII]$\lambda\lambda 6717, 6731$, [NII]$\lambda 6584$, [OI]$\lambda 6300$, [OIII]$\lambda 5007$, and [OII]$\lambda\lambda 3727, 3729$. We find that Euclid will predominantly observe massive, star-forming, and metal-rich line-emitters. Interstellar dust, modelled using a Calzetti law with mass-dependent scaling, may decrease observable percentages by a further 20-30% with respect to our underlying emission-line populations from GAEA. We predict Euclid to observe around 30-70% of H$\alpha$-, [NII]-, [SII]-, and [OIII]-emitting galaxies at redshift below 1 and under 10% at higher redshift. Observability of H$\beta$-, [OII]-, and [OI]- emission is limited to below 5%. For the Euclid-observable sample, we find that BPT diagrams can effectively distinguish between different galaxy types up to around redshift 1.8, attributed to the bias toward metal-rich systems. Moreover, we show that the relationships of H$\alpha$ and [OIII]+H$\beta$ to the star-formation rate, and the [OIII]-AGN luminosity relation, exhibit minimal changes with increasing redshift. Based on line ratios [NII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/[OII], and [NII]/[SII], we further propose novel z-invariant tracers for the black hole accretion rate-to-star formation rate ratio. Lastly, we find that commonly used metallicity estimators display gradual shifts in normalisations with increasing redshift, while maintaining the overall shape of local calibrations. This is in tentative agreement with recent JWST data.
