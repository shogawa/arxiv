  We have studied the accreting black hole binary GX 339-4 using two highly accurate broad-band X-ray data sets in very soft spectral states from simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations. Simultaneous fitting of both data sets with relativistic models of the disk, its Comptonization and reflection allows us to relatively accurately determine the black-hole mass and spin, and the distance and inclination. However, we find the measured values strongly depend on the used disk model. With the widely used thin-disk Kerr models kerrbb and kerrbb2 (which employ color corrections), we find relatively low masses and strongly negative spins. Then, the models utilizing detailed disk atmospheric spectra, bhspec and slimbh, predict moderately positive spins and high masses. When adding a warm corona above the disk (as proposed before for both AGNs and accreting binaries), we find the spin is weakly constrained, but consistent with zero. In all cases, the fitted inclination is low, $\approx$30-$34^\circ$. For the spin aligned with the binary orbit, the mass function for this binary implies large values of the mass, consistent only with those obtained with either slimbh or warm corona. We also test the disk models for an assumed set of mass, distance and inclination. We find that, e.g., kerrbb yields values of the spin parameter lower than bhspec or slimbh by $\sim$0.2-0.3. Our results confirm previously found strong disk-model dependencies of the measured black-hole spin, now for a low-mass X-ray binary.

  In this manuscript, optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with 550 day periodicity related to a candidate of sub-pc binary black hole (BBH) system are reported in the reverberation mapped broad line quasar PG 1411+442 but with different line profile of broad H$\alpha$ from that of broad H$\beta$ in its rms spectrum. First, considering sine function to describe the 18.8years-long light curves from the CSS, ASAS-SN and ZTF, 550days periodicity can be confirmed with confidence level higher than 5$\sigma$. Second, the stable 550days optical QPOs can be re-confirmed with confidence levels higher than 5$\sigma$ by the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the sine-like phase-folded light curves and the WWZ technique determined power maps. Third, based on simulated light curves by CAR process, confidence level higher than $3.5\sigma$ can be confirmed for the optical QPOs not related to intrinsic AGN variability. Moreover, considering spatial separation of central two BH accreting systems smaller than expected sizes of broad emission line regions (BLRs), central total BH mass higher than $10^6{\rm M_\odot}$ could lead to few effects of supposed BBH systems on estimated virial BH masses. Meanwhile, disk precession is not preferred due to the similar estimated sizes of optical and NUV emission regions, and jet precession can be ruled out due to PG 1411+442 as a radio quiet quasar. The results strongly indicate it would be practicable by applying very different line profiles of broad Balmer emission lines to detect candidates of BBH systems in normal broad line AGN in the near future.
