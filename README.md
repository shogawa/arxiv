Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit variability in their luminosities with timescales that correlate with the mass of the black hole at the centre of the AGN. Presently, the empirical correlation lacks sufficient precision to confidently convert these timescales into black hole masses, especially at the low-mass end. To find more AGNs with timescale measurements, we study a very large catalog of AGNs from the Gaia Data Release 3 called GLEAN (Gaia variabLE AgN; 872228 objects). We identify GLEAN objects with optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR17 and light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR21. After fitting the light curves with a damped random walk model, we find that the GLEAN light curves have insufficient sampling to extract reliable amplitude and timescale measurements outside the range of 50-100 days. On the other hand, well-sampled ZTF light curves allow more accurate estimations of these parameters. The fractional variability amplitude is an effective, model-independent metric for measuring variability amplitude, but only when derived from high-quality light curves. We provide a catalog of 127 GLEAN AGNs with spectroscopic virial black hole masses, and variability amplitudes and timescales. Though we do not find any low-mass black holes in this AGN sample, we confirm a relationship between the damped random walk timescale and the black hole mass that is consistent with previous studies.

We present a comprehensive kinematic and ionization analysis of the warm ionized filaments ($10^4$ K) in M87, the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, using new integral field spectroscopy from MEGARA (GTC) and SITELLE (CFHT). MEGARA targets the southeastern (SE) filaments (3 kpc from the nucleus), coincident with the only known molecular gas clump, and the far eastern (FE) filament (15 kpc), spatially isolated within an old radio lobe. SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$α$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases. However, the FE filament deviates from this trend, possibly due to uplift from past AGN outbursts or limitations in the analysis method.
