  In this letter, we measure the rest-frame optical and near-infrared sizes of ten quiescent candidates at 3&lt;z&lt;5, first reported by Carnell et al. (2023a). We use $\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}$ (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) F277W and F444W imaging obtained through the public CEERS Early Release Science (ERS) program and $\textbf{imcascade}$, an astronomical fitting code that utilizes Multi-Gaussian Expansion, to carry out our size measurements. When compared to the extrapolation of rest-optical size-mass relations for quiescent galaxies at lower redshift, eight out of ten candidates in our sample (80%) are on average more compact by $\sim$40%. Seven out of ten candidates (70%) exhibit rest-frame infrared sizes $\sim$10% smaller than rest-frame optical sizes, indicative of negative color gradients. Two candidates (20%) have rest-frame infrared sizes $\sim$1.4$\times$ larger than rest-frame optical sizes; one of these candidates exhibits signs of ongoing or residual star formation, suggesting this galaxy may not be fully quenched. The remaining candidate is unresolved in both filters, which may indicate an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Strikingly, we observe three of the most massive galaxies in the sample (log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 10.74 - 10.95) are extremely compact, with effective radii ${\sim}$0.7 kpc. Our results indicate that quiescent galaxies may be more compact than previously anticipated beyond z&gt;3, even after correcting for potential color gradients. This suggests that the size evolution of quiescent galaxies is steeper than previously anticipated and our current understanding is biased by the limited wavelength capabilities of the $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ (HST) and the presence of negative color gradients in quiescent galaxies.

  A fundamental goal of modern-day astrophysics is to understand the connection between supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth and galaxy evolution. Merging galaxies offer one of the most dramatic channels for galaxy evolution known, capable of driving inflows of gas into galactic nuclei, potentially fueling both star formation and central SMBH activity. Dual active galactic nuclei (dual AGNs) in late-stage mergers with nuclear pair separations $&lt;10$ kpc are thus ideal candidates to study SMBH growth along the merger sequence since they coincide with the most transformative period for galaxies. However, dual AGNs can be extremely difficult to confirm and study. Hard X-ray ($&gt;10$ keV) studies offer a relatively contamination-free tool for probing the dense obscuring environments predicted to surround the majority of dual AGN in late-stage mergers. To date, only a handful of the brightest and closest systems have been studied at these energies due to the demanding instrumental requirements involved. We demonstrate the unique capabilities of HEX-P to spatially resolve the soft and - for the first time - hard X-ray counterparts of closely-separated ($\sim2''-5''$) dual AGNs in the local Universe. By incorporating state-of-the-art physical torus models, we reproduce realistic broadband X-ray spectra expected for deeply embedded accreting SMBHs. Hard X-ray spatially resolved observations of dual AGNs - accessible only to HEX-P - will hence transform our understanding of dual AGN in the nearby Universe.

  In this manuscript, strong evidence is reported to support unobscured broad line regions (BLRs) in Type-1.9 AGN SDSS J1241+2602 with reliable broad H$\alpha$ but no broad H$\beta$. Commonly, disappearance of broad H$\beta$ can be explained by the AGN unified model expected heavily obscured BLRs in Type-1.9 AGN. Here, based on properties of two kinds of BH masses, the virial BH mass and the BH mass through the \msig relation, an independent method is proposed to test whether are there unobscured central BLRs in a Type-1.9 AGN. By the reliable measurement of stellar velocity dispersion about 110$\pm$12km/s through the host galaxy absorption features in \obj, the BH mass through the \msig relation is consistent with the virial BH mass $(3.43\pm1.25)\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ determined through properties of the observed broad H$\alpha$ without considering effects of obscurations in SDSS J1241+2602. Meanwhile, if considering heavily obscured BLRs in SDSS J1241+2602, the reddening corrected virial BH mass is tens of times larger than the \msig expected value, leading SDSS J1241+2602 to be an outlier in the \msig space with confidence level higher than $5\sigma$. Therefore, the unobscured BLRs are preferred in the Type-1.9 AGN SDSS J1241+2602. The results indicate that it is necessary to check whether unobscured central BLRs are common in Type-1.9 AGN, when to test the AGN unified model of AGN by properties of Type-1.9 AGN.

  We develop a model for galaxy formation and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), based on the fact that cold dark matter (CDM) halos form their gravitational potential wells through a fast phase with rapid change in the potential, and that the high universal baryon fraction makes cooled gas in halos self-gravitating and turbulent before it can form rotation-supported disks. Gas fragmentation produces sub-clouds so dense that cloud-cloud collision and drag on clouds are not significant, producing a dynamically hot system of sub-clouds that form stars and move ballistically to feed the central SMBH. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) and supernova (SN) feedback is effective only in the fast phase, and the cumulative effects are to regulate star formation and SMBH growth, as well as to reduce the amount of cold gas in halos to allow the formation of globally stable disks. Using a set of halo assembly histories, we demonstrate that the model can reproduce a number of observations, including correlations among SMBH mass, stellar mass of galaxies and halo mass, the number densities of galaxies and SMBH, as well as their evolution over the cosmic time.

  The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is the main radiation field responsible for attenuating extragalactic gamma-ray emission at very high energies, but its precise spectral intensity is not fully determined. Therefore, disentangling propagation effects from the intrinsic spectral properties of gamma-ray sources (such as active galactic nuclei, AGN) is the primary challenge to interpreting observations of these objects. We present a Bayesian and Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to simultaneously infer parameters characterizing the EBL and the intrinsic spectra in a combined fit of a set of sources, which has the advantage of easily incorporating the uncertainties of both sets of parameters into one another through marginalization of the posterior distribution. Taking a sample of synthetic blazars observed by the ideal CTA configuration, we study the effects on the EBL constraints of combining multiple observations and varying their exposure. We also apply the methodology to a set of 65 gamma-ray spectra of 36 different AGNs measured by current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo as a solution to the difficult task of sampling in spaces with a high number of parameters. We find robust constraints in the mid-IR region while simultaneously obtaining intrinsic spectral parameters for all of these objects. In particular, we identify Markarian 501 (Mkn 501) flare data (HEGRA/1997) as essential for constraining the EBL above 30$\mu$m.

  We report the discovery of a large-scale structure at z=3.44 revealed by JWST data in the EGS field. This structure, dubbed "Cosmic Vine", consists of 20 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts at $3.43&lt;z&lt;3.45$ and six galaxy overdensities with consistent photometric redshifts, making up a vine-like structure extending over a ~4x0.2 pMpc^2 area. The two most massive galaxies (M*~10^10.9 Msun) of the Cosmic Vine are found to be quiescent with bulge-dominated morphologies ($B/T&gt;70\%$). Comparisons with simulations suggest that the Cosmic Vine would form a cluster with halo mass &gt;10^14 Msun at z=0, and the two massive galaxies are likely forming the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). The results unambiguously reveal that massive quiescent galaxies can form in growing large-scale structures at z&gt;3, thus disfavoring the environmental quenching mechanisms that require a virialized cluster core. Instead, as suggested by the interacting and bulge-dominated morphologies, the two galaxies are likely quenched by merger-triggered starburst or AGN feedback before falling into a cluster core. Moreover, we found that the observed specific star formation rates of massive quiescent galaxies in z&gt;3 dense environments are two orders of magnitude lower than that of the BCGs in the TNG300 simulation. This discrepancy potentially poses a challenge to the models of massive cluster galaxy formation. Future studies comparing a large sample with dedicated cluster simulations are required to solve the problem.

  Ever since the discovery of the first Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), substantial observational and theoretical effort has been invested into understanding how massive black holes have evolved across cosmic time. Circum-nuclear obscuration is now established as a crucial component, with almost every AGN observed known to display signatures of some level of obscuration in their X-ray spectra. But despite more than six decades of effort, substantial open questions remain: How does the accretion power impact the structure of the circum-nuclear obscurer? What are the dynamical properties of the obscurer? Can dense circum-nuclear obscuration exist around intrinsically weak AGN? How many intermediate mass black holes occupy the centers of dwarf galaxies? In this paper, we showcase a number of next-generation prospects attainable with the High Energy X-ray Probe (https://hexp.org) to contribute towards solving these questions in the 2030s. The uniquely broad (0.2--80 keV) and strictly simultaneous X-ray passband of HEX-P makes it ideally suited for studying the temporal co-evolution between the central engine and circum-nuclear obscurer. Improved sensitivities and reduced background will enable the development of spectroscopic models complemented by current and future multi-wavelength observations. We show that the angular resolution of HEX-P both below and above 10 keV will enable the discovery and confirmation of accreting massive black holes at both low accretion power and low black hole masses even when concealed by thick obscuration. In combination with other next-generation observations of the dusty hearts of nearby galaxies, HEX-P will hence be pivotal in paving the way towards a complete picture of black hole growth and galaxy co-evolution.
