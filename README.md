  The effect of baryon physics associated with galaxy formation onto the large-scale matter distribution of the Universe is a key uncertainty in the theoretical modelling required for the interpretation of Stage IV cosmology surveys. We use the FLAMINGO suite of simulations to study the baryon response due to galaxy formation of the total matter power spectrum. We find that it is only well converged for simulation volumes in excess of $(200~Mpc)^3$. We report results for simulations of varying feedback intensity, which either match the X-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters and the z=0 stellar mass function, or shifted versions of the data, as well as for different implementations of AGN feedback. We package our results in the form of a Gaussian process emulator which can rapidly reproduce all the simulations' predictions to better than 1% up to the comoving wavenumber $k = 10~h/Mpc$ and up to z=2 for all the feedback models present in the FLAMINGO suite. We find that the response becomes stronger, the range of scales affected increases, and the position of the minimum of the response moves to smaller scales as the redshift decreases. We find that lower gas fractions in groups and clusters lead to a stronger response and that the use of collimated jets instead of thermally driven winds for AGN feedback enhances the effect. Lowering the stellar masses at fixed cluster gas fractions also increases the magnitude of the response. We find only a small (1% at $k&lt;10~h/Mpc$) dependence of our results on the background cosmology, but a wider range of cosmology variations will be needed to confirm this result. The response we obtain for our strongest feedback models is compatible with some of the recent analyses combining weak lensing with external data. Such a response is, however, in strong tension with the X-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters used to calibrate the FLAMINGO model.

  We report the HST WFC3 G141 grism slitless spectroscopy observation of the core region of the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$. We analyzed the spectra of all objects in a $\sim 2 \times 2 \text{ arcmin}^2$ field of view and identified 40 protocluster members, recovering 19 previously identified H$\alpha$-emitters in addition to revealing 21 new members. The spectra allowed us to identify 11 galaxies with quiescent spectra. Three galaxies with quiescent spectra are possibly still star-forming according to SED fitting, indicating a possible left-over or dust-obscured star formation. We estimate a quiescent fraction of $\sim 50\%$ for $M_\star &gt; 10^{11} M_\odot$. About half of the quiescent galaxies possibly host AGN, hinting at AGN's key role in quenching galaxies in the protocluster environment. These quiescent galaxies have relatively more compact and concentrated light profiles than the star-forming members, but they are not yet as bulge-dominated as local ellipticals. These results are consistent with previous studies that indicate the Spiderweb protocluster is in the maturing stage, with a red sequence that has begun forming.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are a promising source of the binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in gravitational waves with LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK). Constraining the AGN channel allows us to limit AGN parameter space (disk density, size, average lifetime) and nuclear star cluster (NSC) parameter space. Constraints on AGN and NSCs have implications for $\Lambda$CDM models of AGN feedback and models of AGN-driven SMBH merger and growth. Here we present several qualitative studies of the AGN channel using new public, open-source, fast, reproducible code \texttt{McFACTS}\footnote{https://github.com/mcfacts}:Monte Carlo for AGN channel Testing \&amp; Simulation. We demonstrate several important features for testing the AGN channel, including: i) growth to large mass IMBH is helped by the presence of migration traps or disk boundaries, ii) flat BH initial mass functions highlight hierarchical merger features in the mass spectrum, iii) high rates of dynamical encounters strongly inhibit BBH formation and merger at migration traps, iv) the ($q,\chi_{\rm eff}$) anti-correlation is a strong test of the bias to prograde mergers in the AGN channel, v) spheroid encounters can drive a fraction of mergers with high in-plane spin components ($\chi_{\rm p}$), vi) a high rate of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are driven by an initial population of embedded retrograde BH, vii) Both LVK and LISA are powerful probes of models of AGN disks and their embedded populations.

  The baryonic physics shaping galaxy formation and evolution are complex, spanning a vast range of scales and making them challenging to model. Cosmological simulations rely on subgrid models that produce significantly different predictions. Understanding how models of stellar and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback affect baryon behavior across different halo masses and redshifts is essential. Using the SIMBA and IllustrisTNG suites from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, we explore the effect of parameters governing the subgrid implementation of stellar and AGN feedback. We find that while IllustrisTNG shows higher cumulative feedback energy across all halos, SIMBA demonstrates a greater spread of baryons, quantified by the closure radius and circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas fraction. This suggests that feedback in SIMBA couples more effectively to baryons and drives them more efficiently within the host halo. There is evidence that different feedback modes are highly interrelated in these subgrid models. Parameters controlling stellar feedback efficiency significantly impact AGN feedback, as seen in the suppression of black hole mass growth and delayed activation of AGN feedback to higher mass halos with increasing stellar feedback efficiency in both simulations. Additionally, AGN feedback efficiency parameters affect the CGM gas fraction at low halo masses in SIMBA, hinting at complex, non-linear interactions between AGN and SNe feedback modes. Overall, we demonstrate that stellar and AGN feedback are intimately interwoven, especially at low redshift, due to subgrid implementation, resulting in halo property effects that might initially seem counterintuitive.

  The circumgalactic medium (CGM) in $\gtrsim 10^{12}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos is dominated by a hot phase ($T \gtrsim 10^{6}$ K). While many models exist for the hot gas structure, there is as yet no consensus. We compare cooling flow models, in which the hot CGM flows inward due to radiative cooling, to the CGM of $\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos in galaxy formation simulations from the FIRE project at $z\sim0$. The simulations include realistic cosmological evolution and feedback from stars but neglect AGN feedback. At both mass scales, CGM inflows are typically dominated by the hot phase rather than by the `precipitation' of cold gas. Despite being highly idealized, we find that cooling flows describe $\sim 10^{13}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos very well, with median agreement in the density and temperature profiles of $\sim 20\%$ and $\sim 10\%$, respectively. This indicates that stellar feedback has little impact on CGM scales in those halos. For $\sim 10^{12}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos, the thermodynamic profiles are also accurately reproduced in the outer CGM. For some of these lower-mass halos, cooling flows significantly overpredict the hot gas density in the inner CGM. This could be due to multidimensional angular momentum effects not well captured by our 1D cooling flow models and/or to the larger cold gas fractions in these regions. Turbulence, which contributes $\sim 10-40\%$ of the total pressure, must be included to accurately reproduce the temperature profiles. Overall, cooling flows predict entropy profiles in better agreement with the FIRE simulations than other idealized models in the literature.

  In this paper, we attempt to explain the TeV-PeV neutrinos observed by IceCube assuming that their sources are active galactic nuclei (AGN). The results are obtained in the model where the accretion disc emits in the UV-optical range inside the electron plasma cloud. Using the Monte-Carlo approach to model photopion interactions in jets and then after taking into account the cosmological evolution it is shown that the resulting spectrum can explain the observed neutrino flux.
