  For the first time, a calibration between the HeI $\lambda5876$/H$\beta$ emission line ratio and the helium abundance $y$=12+log(He/H) for Narrow line regions (NLRs) of Seyfert~2 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is proposed. In this context, observational data (taken from the SDSS-DR15 and from the literature) and direct abundance estimates (via the $T_{\rm e}$-method) for a sample of 65 local ($z \: &lt; \: 0.2$) Seyfert~2 nuclei are considered. The resulting calibration estimates the $y$ abundance with an average uncertainty of 0.02 dex. Applying our calibration to spectroscopic data containing only strong emission lines, it yields a helium abundance distribution similar to that obtained via the $T_{\rm e}$-method. Some cautions must be considered to apply our calibration for Seyfert~2 nuclei with high values of electron temperature ($\gtrsim\: 20\,000$ K) or ionization parameter ($\log U &gt; -2.0$).

  We present a study of $1347$ galaxies at $z&lt;0.35$ with detected nuclear X-ray emission and optical emission line diagnostics in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. This sample was obtained by cross-matching the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission Observatory - Newton (XMM-Newton) DR10 catalogue with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 galaxies with well-measured line ratios. The distribution of these sources in the BPT diagram covers all three excitation regimes: Ionized Hydrogen (HII) regions (23\%), `composites' (30\%), and Seyfert galaxies with the low ionization nuclear emission line regions (LINERs) (47\%). In contrast, the fraction of objects classified as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the SDSS subsample selected for cross-match with XMM-Newton is only 13\%. This fact illustrates that X-ray emission from galaxies commonly points towards the presence of AGN. Our data show, for the first time, a clear dependence of the BPT position on the ratio of the X-ray to $H\alpha$ fluxes. Sources dominated by X-ray emission lie in the Seyfert and LINER regimes of the BPT diagram. Most sources with a low X-ray-to-$H\alpha$-luminosity ratio, $log_{10}(L_X/L_{H\alpha}) &lt; 1.0$, lie in the HII regime. In our sample, there are even 45 galaxies that have $L^{Star}_{XR}/L^{Total}_{Xray}&gt;0.5$. In contrast, the positions of the sample members in the BPT diagram exhibit {no} dependence on the X-ray hardness ratio. Our finding suggests that the X-ray-to-$H\alpha$ ratio can help us to differentiate galaxies whose X-ray flux is dominated by an AGN {from galaxies with} central X-ray binaries and other stellar X-ray sources.

  High-redshift blazars provide valuable input to studies of the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and provide constraints on cosmological models. Detections at high energies ($0.1&lt;\mathrm{E}&lt;100$ GeV) of these distant sources are rare, but when they exhibit bright gamma-ray flares, we are able to study them. However, contemporaneous multi-wavelength observations of high-redshift objects ($z&gt;4$) during their different periods of activity have not been carried out so far. An excellent opportunity for such a study arose when the blazar TXS 1508+572 ($z=4.31$) exhibited a $\gamma$-ray flare in 2022 February in the $0.1-300$ GeV range with a flux 25 times brighter than the one reported in the in the fourth catalog of the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope. Our goal is to monitor the morphological changes, spectral index and opacity variations that could be associated with the preceding $\gamma$-ray flare in TXS 1508+572 to find the origin of the high-energy emission in this source. We also plan to compare the source characteristics in the radio band to the blazars in the local Universe ($z&lt;0.1$). In addition, we aim to collect quasi-simultaneous data to our multi-wavelength observations of the object, making TXS 1508+572 the first blazar in the early Universe ($z&gt;4$) with contemporaneous multi-frequency data available in its high state. In order to study the parsec-scale structure of the source, we performed three epochs of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) follow-up observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) supplemented with the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope at 15, 22, and 43 GHz, which corresponds to 80, 117, and 228 GHz in the rest frame of TXS 1508+572. In addition, one 86 GHz (456 GHz) measurement was performed by the VLBA and the Green Bank Telescope during the first epoch.

  In the past five years, six quasi-periodic X-ray eruption (QPE) sources have been discovered in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. Their origin remains an open question. We present MUSE integral field spectroscopy of five QPE host galaxies to characterize their properties. We find that 3/5 galaxies host extended emission line regions (EELRs) up to 10 kpc in size. The EELRs are photo-ionized by a non-stellar continuum, but the current nuclear luminosity is insufficient to power the observed emission lines. The EELRs are decoupled from the stars both kinematically and in projected sky position, and the low velocities and velocity dispersions ($&lt;$ 100 km s$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim 75$ km s$^{-1}$ respectively) are inconsistent with being AGN- or shock-driven. The origin of the EELRs is likely a previous phase of nuclear activity. The QPE host galaxy properties are strikingly similar to those of tidal disruption events (Wevers et al. submitted). The preference for a very short-lived (the typical EELR lifetime is $\sim$15000 years), gas-rich phase where the nucleus has recently faded significantly suggests that TDEs and QPEs may share a common formation channel, disfavoring AGN accretion disk instabilities as the origin of QPEs. In the assumption that QPEs are related to extreme mass ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs; stellar-mass objects on bound orbits about massive black holes), the high incidence of EELRs and recently faded nuclear activity can be used to aid in the localization of the host galaxies of EMRIs discovered by low frequency gravitational wave observatories.   

Extended emission line regions in post-starburst galaxies hosting tidal
  disruption events

  We report the discovery of an extended emission line region (EELR) in MUSE observations of Markarian 950, a nearby ($z=0.01628$) post-starburst (PSB) galaxy that hosted the tidal disruption event (TDE) iPTF-16fnl. The EELR requires a non-stellar ionizing continuum with a luminosity L$_{\rm ion, min} \gtrsim 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, inconsistent with the current weak state (L$_{\rm IR,AGN} &lt; 2.5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the galactic nucleus. The ionized gas has low velocity ($\sim$-50 km s$^{-1}$) and low turbulence ($\sigma_{\rm gas} \lesssim$ 50 km s$^{-1}$), and is kinematically decoupled from the stellar motions, indicating that the gas kinematics are not AGN driven. Markarian 950 is the third post-starburst galaxy to host a weak nuclear ionizing source as well as an EELR and a TDE. The overall properties of these three galaxies, including the kinematics and accretion history, are unusual but strikingly similar. We estimate that the incidence of EELRs in PSB-TDE hosts is a factor of $\sim 10 \times$ higher than in other PSB galaxies. This suggests that a gas-rich post-merger environment is a key ingredient in driving elevated TDE rates. Based on the current observations, we cannot rule out that the EELRs may be powered through an elevated TDE rate in these galaxies. If the EELRs are not TDE-powered, the presence of intermittent AGN activity, and in particular the fading of the AGN, may be associated with an increased TDE rate and/or an increased rate of detecting TDEs.   

Discrepancies Between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched

  Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses $9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &lt; 12$. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ compared to JWST observations by up to $\sim 2$ dex. This fact highlights the necessity for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. In both simulations, the high-$z$ quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the standard $M_{BH}-M_\star$ relation, implying that the AGN feedback plays a crucial role in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are $\sim 200-600$ Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-$z$ massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of $z=0$ brightest cluster galaxies.
