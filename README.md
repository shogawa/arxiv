  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) influence their host galaxies through winds and jets that can drive molecular outflows, traceable with CO line emissions using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). Recent studies leveraging ALMA data have proposed a three-dimensional outflow geometry in the nearby Seyfert II galaxy NGC 1068, a key target for AGN unification theories. Using ALMA observations of CO(2-1), CO(3-2), and CO(6-5) transitions at roughly 0.1 arcseconds (approximately 7 parsecs) resolution, we analyzed the temperature, density, and kinematics of NGC 1068's circumnuclear disk (CND), focusing on the molecular outflow. Through local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we derived column densities and rotational temperatures, indicating optically thin gas and CO-to-H2 (XCO) conversion factors between 4.8 and 9.6 times smaller than the Milky Way value. The inferred molecular mass outflow rate is mostly below 5.5 solar masses per year, with the dominant contribution northeast of the AGN. After subtracting the rotation curve of the CND, we modeled averaged line profiles in each region using single and multi-component Gaussian fits. Several profiles within or near the AGN wind bicone required multiple components with significant velocity shifts, suggesting multi-component complex outflow kinematics. We observe lateral variation in CO kinematics along the AGN wind bicone and a misalignment between the molecular and ionized outflow directions. These results imply that the dynamic impact of the ionized AGN wind on the molecular gas in the CND may be limited. However, the molecular outflow shows a complex, asymmetric structure.

  Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulate the evolution of their host galaxies through powerful outflows and multi-phase feedback. This process plays a crucial role in shaping SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, but direct evidence linking nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows, particularly in high-redshift quasars, has remained elusive. Here we present statistical evidence of a connection between nuclear winds and large-scale cold gas outflows in quasars at $z \sim 5.5$. Using stacked [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, we compare broad absorption line (BAL) quasars -- tracing parsec- to sub-kiloparsec-scale nuclear winds -- with non-BAL quasars. The BAL stack reveals a significant (S/N=4.45) broad component in the [C II] emission, indicating high-velocity neutral gas outflows with a velocity offset of $\Delta v_{\rm b} = -2.1 \times 10^2 \, \rm km\,s^{-1}$ and a full width at half maximum of $1.18 \times 10^3 \, \rm km\,s^{-1}$, while the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent up to one-quarter of the BAL wind energy is transferred to neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These findings provide direct observational evidence that nuclear winds couple with galactic-scale neutral gas flows, supporting multi-phase AGN feedback models. This mechanism may contribute to explaining the diversity of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$ ratios observed in some luminous AGN recently observed by JWST, compared to the Magorrian relation.
