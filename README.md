  We report on a remarkable change in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Mrk 841, providing new insights on how the soft X-ray excess emission in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is produced. By Swift monitoring of a sample of Seyfert-1 galaxies, we found an X-ray spectral hardening event in Mrk 841. We thereby triggered our XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST observations in 2022 to study this event. Our previous investigations of such events in other AGNs had shown that they are caused by obscuring winds. However, the event in Mrk 841 has different spectral characteristics and origin. We find it is the soft X-ray excess component that has become dimmer. This is, importantly, accompanied by a similar decline in the optical/UV continuum, suggesting a connection to the soft X-ray excess. In contrast, there is relatively little change in the X-ray power-law and the reflection components. Our SED modeling suggests that the soft X-ray excess is the high-energy extension of the optical/UV disk emission, produced by warm Comptonization. We find the temperature of the disk dropped in 2022, explaining the observed SED dimming. We then examined the Swift data, taken over 15 years, to further decipher the UV and X-ray variabilities of Mrk 841. A significant relation between the variabilities of the X-ray spectral hardness and that of the UV continuum is found, again suggesting that the soft excess and the disk emission are interlinked. This is readily explicable if the soft excess is produced by warm Comptonization.

  Radio-mode feedback is a key ingredient in galaxy formation and evolution models, required to reproduce the observed properties of massive galaxies in the local Universe. We study the cosmic evolution of radio-AGN feedback out to $z\sim2.5$ using a sample of 9485 radio-excess AGN. We combine the evolving radio luminosity functions with a radio luminosity scaling relationship to estimate AGN jet kinetic powers and derive the cosmic evolution of the kinetic luminosity density, $\Omega_{\rm{kin}}$ (i.e. the volume-averaged heating output). Compared to all radio-AGN, low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) dominate the feedback activity out to $z\sim2.5$, with both these populations showing a constant heating output of $\Omega_{\rm{kin}} \approx 4-5 \times 10^{32}\,\rm{W\,Mpc^{-3}}$ across $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$. We compare our observations to predictions from semi-analytical and hydrodynamical simulations, which broadly match the observed evolution in $\Omega_{\rm{kin}}$, although their absolute normalisation varies. Comparison to the Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) model suggests that radio-AGN may provide sufficient heating to offset radiative cooling losses, providing evidence for a self-regulated AGN feedback cycle. We integrate the kinetic luminosity density across cosmic time to obtain the kinetic energy density output from AGN jets throughout cosmic history to be $\sim 10^{50}\,\rm{J\,Mpc^{-3}}$. Compared to AGN winds, the kinetic energy density from AGN jets dominates the energy budget at $z \lesssim 2$; this suggests that AGN jets play an important role in AGN feedback across most of cosmic history.
