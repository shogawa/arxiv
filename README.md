  We propose a mechanism to explain the low-frequency QPOs observed in X-ray binary systems and AGNs. To do this, we perturbed stable accretion disks around Kerr and EGB black holes at different angular velocities, revealing the characteristics of shock waves and oscillations presented on the disk. Applying this perturbation to scenarios with different alpha values for EGB black holes and different spin parameters for Kerr black holes, we numerically observed changes in the dynamic structure of the disk and oscillations. Through various numerical modeling, we found that the formation of one- and two-armed spiral shock waves on the disk serves as a mechanism for the generation of QPOs. We compared the QPOs obtained from numerical calculations with the low-frequency QPOs observed in $X-$ray binary systems and AGN sources. We found that the results obtained are highly consistent with observations. We observed that the shock mechanism on the disk, which leads to quasi-periodic oscillations, explains the X-ray binaries and AGNs studied in this article. As a result of the numerical findings, we find that QPOs are more strongly dependent on the EGB constant rather than the black hole's spin parameter However, we highlighted that the primary impact on oscillations and QPOs is driven by the perturbation's angular velocity. According to the results obtained from the models, it has been observed that the perturbation's asymptotic speed at V_{\infty}=0.2 is responsible for generating QPO frequencies independently of the black hole's spin parameter and the EGB coupling constant. Therefore, for the moderate value of V_{\infty}, a two-armed spiral shock wave formed on the disk is suggested as a decisive mechanism in explaining low-frequency QPOs.

  We report the discovery of broad components with P-Cygni profiles of the hydrogen and helium emission lines in the two low-redshift low-metallicity dwarf compact star-forming galaxies (SFG), SBS 1420+540 and J1444+4840. We found small stellar masses of 10^{6.24} and 10^{6.59} M$_\odot$, low oxygen abundances 12+log O/H of 7.75 and 7.45, high velocity dispersions reaching $\sigma$ ~700 and ~1200km/s, high terminal velocities of the stellar wind of ~1000 and ~1000-1700km/s, respectively, and large EW(H$\beta$) of ~300A for both. For SBS 1420+540, we succeeded in capturing an eruption phase by monitoring the variations of the broad-to-narrow component flux ratio. We observe a sharp increase of that ratio by a factor 4 in 2017 and a decrease by about an order of magnitude in 2023. The peak luminosity of ~10^{40}ergs/s of the broad component in $L$(H$\alpha$) lasted for about 6 years out of a three-decades monitoring. This leads us to conclude that there is probably a LBV candidate (LBVc) in this galaxy. As for J1444+4840, its very high $L$(H$\alpha$) of about 10^{41}ergs/s, close to values observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and Type IIn Supernovae (SNe), and the variability of no more than 20 per cent of the broad-to-narrow flux ratio of the hydrogen and helium emission lines over a 8-year monitoring do not allow us to definitively conclude that it contains a LBVc. On the other hand, the possibility that the line variations are due to a long-lived stellar transient of type LBV/SNIIn cannot be ruled out.

  We constrain cosmology and baryonic feedback scenarios with a joint analysis of weak lensing, galaxy clustering, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing, and their cross-correlations (so-called 6$\times$2) using data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 and the Planck satellite mission. Noteworthy features of our 6$\times$2 pipeline are: We extend CMB lensing cross-correlation measurements to a band surrounding the DES Y1 footprint (a $\sim 25\%$ gain in pairs), and we develop analytic covariance capabilities that account for different footprints and all cross-terms in the 6$\times$2 analysis. We also measure the DES Y1 cosmic shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) down to $0.^\prime 25$, but find that going below $2.^\prime 5$ does not increase cosmological information due to shape noise. We model baryonic physics uncertainties via the amplitude of Principal Components (PCs) derived from a set of hydro-simulations. Given our statistical uncertainties, varying the first PC amplitude $Q_1$ is sufficient to model small-scale cosmic shear 2PCF. For DES Y1+Planck 6$\times$2 we find $S_8=0.799\pm0.016$, comparable to the 5$\times$2 result of DES Y3+SPT/Planck $S_8=0.773\pm0.016$. Combined with our most informative cosmology priors -- baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and Planck 2018 EE+lowE, we measure $S_8=0.817\pm 0.011$. Regarding baryonic physics constraints, our 6$\times$2 analysis finds $Q_1=2.8\pm1.8$. Combined with the aforementioned priors, it improves the constraint to $Q_1=3.5\pm1.3$. For comparison, the strongest feedback scenario considered in this paper, the cosmo-OWLS AGN ($\Delta T_\mathrm{heat}=10^{8.7}$ K), corresponds to $Q_1=5.84$.

  The nature and origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remain an open matter of debate within the scientific community. While various theoretical scenarios have been proposed, each with specific observational signatures, the lack of sufficiently sensitive X-ray observations hinders the progress of observational tests. In this white paper, we present how AXIS will contribute to solving this issue. With an angular resolution of 1.5$^{\prime\prime}$ on-axis and minimal off-axis degradation, we have designed a deep survey capable of reaching flux limits in the [0.5-2] keV range of approximately 2$\times$10$^{-18}$ \fcgs~ over an area of 0.13 deg$^2$ in approximately 7 million seconds (7 Ms). Furthermore, we have planned an intermediate depth survey covering approximately 2 deg$^2$ and reaching flux limits of about 2$\times$10$^{-17}$ \fcgs ~ in order to detect a significant number of SMBHs with X-ray luminosities (L$_X$) of approximately 10$^{42}$ \lx up to z$\sim$10. These observations will enable AXIS to detect SMBHs with masses smaller than 10$^5$ \ms, assuming Eddington-limited accretion and a typical bolometric correction for Type II AGN. AXIS will provide valuable information on the seeding and population synthesis models of SMBH, allowing for more accurate constraints on their initial mass function (IMF) and accretion history from z$\sim$0-10. To accomplish this, AXIS will leverage the unique synergy of survey telescopes such as JWST, Roman, Euclid, LSST, and the new generation of 30m class telescopes. These instruments will provide optical identification and redshift measurements, while AXIS will discover the smoking gun of nuclear activity, particularly in the case of highly obscured AGN or peculiar UV spectra as predicted and recently observed in the early Universe.

  Pairs of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are observational flags of merger-driven SMBH growth, and represent an observable link between galaxy mergers and gravitational wave (GW) events. Thus, studying these systems across their various evolutionary phases can help quantify the role mergers play in the growth of SMBHs as well as future GW signals expected to be detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). At the earliest stage, the system can be classified as a "dual AGN" where the SMBHs are gravitationally unbound and have typical separations &lt;30 kpc, and at the latest stage the system can be classified as a "binary AGN" where the two massive host galaxies have likely been interacting for hundreds of megayears to gigayears. However, detecting and confirming pairs of AGN is non-trivial, and is complicated by the unique characteristics of merger-environments. To date, there are less than 50 X-ray confirmed dual AGN and only 1 strong binary AGN candidate. AXIS will revolutionize the field of dual AGN: the point-spread-function (PSF), field-of-view (FOV), and effective area (Aeff) are expected to result in the detection of hundreds to thousands of new dual AGN across the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 4. The AXIS AGN surveys will result in the first X-ray study that quantifies the frequency of dual AGN as a function of redshift up to z = 3.5.
