  Context. We present high-resolution MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum images of star-forming spirals in the nearby galaxy groups around NGC 6221, NGC 3256/3263 and NGC 2434. This sample spans the evolutionary timeline for galaxy groups, encompassing early, intermediate, and late stages, respectively. The NGC 6221 group contains an interacting galaxy pair with tidal debris, along with at least three dwarf galaxies. In contrast, the NGC 3256/3263 group represents a loose group consisting of several spiral as well as dwarf galaxies, while a massive elliptical galaxy dominates the NGC 2434 group. Aims. We study the star formation activity in all detected galaxies, as it is one of the dominant physical processes in their formation and evolution, seeking evidence of environmental impact. Methods. We use MeerKAT radio continuum data and archival WISE infrared data to locate and measure the star formation rate in all group members. In particular, we used polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as tracers of gas heated due to star formation activity. Furthermore, we create in-band spectral index maps, providing insights into the underlying physical processes associated with the detected star-forming regions. Results. We found that galaxies are distributed differently in the WISE colour-colour diagram depending on their evolutionary group stage, as expected. Except for ESO 059-G012, the galaxies in our sample follow the radio-W3PAH correlation. A possible scenario that explains the ESO 059-G012 result is that the galaxy has already consumed the gas. We also found evidence that the interaction among the spiral galaxies NGC 3263, NGC 3256B and NGC 3256C is causing the Vela Cloud complex and that the galaxies NGC 6221 and NGC 3256 might host a low-luminosity AGN, as was previously proposed in the literature.

  Observing the interplay between galaxies and their gaseous surroundings is crucial for understanding how galaxies form and evolve, including the roles of long-lived cool gas reservoirs, starburst and AGN driven outflows. We use stacked Mg II absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars to study the cool gas out to 9Mpc from massive quiescent, star-forming and post-starburst galaxies with stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{gal}}/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.4$ and $0.4 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.8$ selected from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS galaxies. Consistent with previous studies, we observe a decline in absorption strength indicating a decrease in cool gas content with increasing distance from the galaxies, as well as decreasing star formation rate of the galaxies. Beyond 1Mpc, this decline levels off to the same absorption strength in all galaxy types, suggesting a transition from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to the intergalactic medium (IGM) at approximately the virial radius of the host dark matter haloes. We find that post-starburst galaxies, that have experienced a recent burst of star formation that has rapidly quenched, exhibit significantly stronger Mg II absorption within 1Mpc than star-forming or quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass. Because post-starburst galaxies are a potentially significant pathway for the formation of quiescent elliptical galaxies, our results have wide reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms involved in quenching star formation in galaxies. We speculate that the excess cool gas absorption out to 1Mpc around post-starburst galaxies is related to their observed high velocity ($\sim$1000\,km/s) cool gas outflows. Thus, strong, short-lived bursts of star formation impact the CGM around galaxies on Mpc distances and Gyr timescales.

  We estimated radiative efficiency, spin and SMBH mass values for sample of 33 distant low luminosity AGNs. The distribution of the estimated spin values (majority of objects have a spin greater than 0.8) is fairly typical for many types of AGNs. The dependence of the estimated spin values on the estimated SMBH masses shows strong correlation between them, which suggests a rapid increase in spin with mass, i.e. that the main mechanism of mass growth in this case is disk accretion. We did not find any significant qualitative differences in the spin characteristics between our objects and objects of other types considered in the paper.

  JWST has revealed a large population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the distant universe, which are challenging our understanding of early massive black hole seeding and growth. We expand the exploration of this population to lower luminosities by stacking $\sim 600$ NIRSpec grating spectra from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) at $3&lt;z&lt;7$, in bins of redshift, [OIII]5007 luminosity and equivalent width, UV luminosity and stellar mass. In various stacks, we detect a broad component of H$\alpha$ without a counterpart in [OIII], implying that it is not due to outflows but is tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of a large population of low-luminosity AGN not detected in individual spectra. We also consider the possible contribution from Supernovae (SNe) and Very Massive Stars and conclude that while this is very unlikely, we cannot exclude some potential contribution by SNe to some of the stacks. The detection, in some stacks, of high [OIII]4363/H$\gamma$, typical of AGN, further confirms that such stacks reveal a large population of AGN. We infer that the stacks probe black holes with masses of a few times $10^6~M_\odot$ accreting at rates $L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.02-0.1$, i.e. a low mass and dormant parameter space poorly explored by previous studies on individual targets. We identify populations of black holes that fall within the scatter of the local $M_{BH}-M_{*}$ scaling relation, indicating that there is a population of high-z BHs that are not overmassive relative to their host galaxies and which have been mostly missed in previous JWST observations. Yet, on average, the stacks are still overmassive relative the local relation, with some of them 1-2 dex above it. We infer that the BH mass function (BHMF) at $3&lt;z&lt;5$ rises steeply at low masses. The BHMF is consistent with models in which BHs evolve through short bursts of super-Eddington accretion.

  Feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a key process in the evolution of massive halos in the Universe. New observational information on feedback is crucial for improving the implementation of the physics in numerical models. In this work, we apply a novel image-manipulation technique, termed 'X-arithmetic', to a sample of 15 galaxy clusters and groups deeply observed with Chandra. This technique decomposes perturbations in feedback-dominated regions into images excluding either (1) weak shocks and sound waves, (2) bubbles inflated by jets, or (3) cooling and slow gas motions (isobaric perturbations), enabling efficient spatial identification of these features without involving spectroscopic analysis. We confirm the nature of previously (spectroscopically-)identified features and newly establish the origin of other structures. We find that feedback produces multiple shocks in groups and massive galaxies, but only one to two shocks in clusters. Prominent isobaric structures are abundant around inner cavities in clusters, compared to almost no such structures in groups. These differences suggest that feedback effects are stronger in smaller-mass systems, possibly due to the shallower gravitational potential of groups or more violent feedback. Follow-up spectroscopy, guided by the X-arithmetic results, suggests that earlier-identified "isothermal shocks" could be a mix of isobaric and adiabatic structures. We applied X-arithmetic to galaxy cluster simulations, demonstrating its straightforward application and future potential for testing the feedback physics details in simulations. Our feasibility study shows that imaging data from future X-ray observatories like AXIS will be ideal for expanding X-arithmetic application to a larger sample of objects.

  We present a multiwavelength study of the gas distribution, kinematics and excitation of the OH megamaser galaxy IRAS 09320+6134 (UGC 5101) using Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph Integral Field Unit, Hubble Space Telescope, and Very Large Array observations. The HST ACS F814W i-band and H$\alpha$ + [N II] $\lambda\lambda$ 6548,84 narrow-band images indicate that this galaxy is a late-stage merger. The ionized gas emission in the inner $\sim$ 2 kpc radius, traced by the GMOS data, is consistent with two kinematic components: (i) a rotating disk, observed as a narrow component in the emission-line profiles, with velocity dispersion of $\sigma$ $\leq$ 200 km s$^{-1}$, and (ii) an outflow, traced by a broad component in the emission-line profiles, with $\sigma\geq$ 500 km s$^{-1}$. The disk component is well reproduced by a model of rotation in a plane with similar orientation to that of the large-scale galaxy disk. The outflow component presents bulk velocities of up to -500 km s$^{-1}$ and corresponds to a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}_o = 0.122 \pm 0.026 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Emission-line ratio diagrams indicate that the gas excitation is mainly due to an active galactic nucleus, likely the driver of the outflow. The VLA radio image reveals a dominant radio core with two-sided emission along the NE-SW direction. The radio core's spectral index and brightness temperature indicate AGN emission, with the extended emission resembling both in morphology and spectral index the emission observed in radio-quiet quasars. Combined with previous similar studies of other OHM galaxies, the present work supports that this phase is linked to the triggering of an AGN, that seems to occur in the final stages of a merger.

  We present morphological classifications for the hosts of 1189 hard X-ray selected (14-195 keV) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Swift-BAT 105-month catalog as part of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). BASS provides a powerful all-sky census of nearby AGN, minimizing obscuration biases and providing a robust dataset for studying AGN-host galaxy connections. Classifications are based on volunteer-based visual inspection on the Zooniverse platform, adapted from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (GZD). Dual-contrast grz color composite images, generated from public surveys (e.g., NOAO Legacy Survey, Pan-STARRS, SDSS) and dedicated observations enabled key morphological features to be identified. Our analysis reveals that, with respect to a control sample of inactive galaxies matched in redshift and i-band magnitude, BASS AGN hosts show a deficiency of smooth ellipticals (~70%) and disks with prominent arms (~80%), while displaying an excess of mergers or disturbed systems (~400%), and disk galaxies without a spiral structure (~300%). These trends suggest a preference for AGN activity in gas-rich, dynamically disturbed environments or transitional disk systems. We also find a higher bar fraction among AGN hosts than the control sample (~50% vs. ~30%). We further explore the relations between AGN properties (e.g., X-ray luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio) and host morphology, and find that high-luminosity and high-accretion AGN preferentially reside in smooth or point-like hosts. In parallel, lower-luminosity AGN are more common in disk galaxies. These results underscore the importance of morphological studies in understanding the fueling and feedback mechanisms that drive AGN activity and their role in galaxy evolution. Our dataset provides a valuable benchmark for future multiwavelength surveys (e.g. LSST, Roman, and Euclid) and automated morphological classification efforts.

  The process of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) fuelling relies on the transport of gas across several orders of magnitude in physical scale until the gas reaches the supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy. This work explores the role of kinematically misaligned gas in the fuelling of AGN in a sample of 4769 local galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We investigate for the first time the relative role of external interactions and the presence of kinematic misalignment as mechanisms to explain the observed increase in AGN fraction in galaxies with large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment ($&gt;$45 degrees). Using a sample of galaxies with evidence of recent external interactions we find that there is a significantly higher fraction of AGN in those where a large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment is observed (20$^{+6}_{-4}\%$) compared with 6.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\%$ in galaxies where no kinematic misalignment is observed. We determine that gas to stellar misalignment has an important role in the fraction of AGN observed, increasing the AGN fraction beyond the potential effect of external interactions. This result demonstrates the importance of misaligned structures to the fuelling of supermassive black holes.

  The large-scale environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) reveal important information on the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Previous AGN clustering measurements using 2-point correlation functions have hinted that AGN with massive black holes preferentially reside in denser cosmic regions than AGN with less-massive SMBHs. At the same time, little to no dependence on the accretion rate is found. However, the significance of such trends have been limited. Here we present kth-nearest-neighbor (kNN) statistics of 2MASS galaxies around AGN from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic survey. These statistics have been shown to contribute additional higher-order clustering information on the cosmic density field. By calculating the distances to the nearest 7 galaxy neighbors in angular separation to each AGN within two redshift ranges(0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.03 and 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.06), we compare their cumulative distribution functions to that of a randomly distributed sample to show the sensitivity of this method to the clustering of AGN. We also split the AGN into bins of bolometric luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio (while controlling for redshift) to search for trends between kNN statistics and fundamental AGN properties. We find that AGN with massive SMBHs have significantly closer neighbors than AGN with less-massive SMBHs (at the 99.98% confidence level), especially in our lower redshift range. We find less significant trends with luminosity or Eddington ratio. By comparing our results to empirical SMBH-galaxy-halo models implemented in N-body simulations, we show that small-scale kNN trends with black hole mass may go beyond stellar mass dependencies. This suggests that massive SMBHs in the local universe reside in more massive dark matter halos and denser regions of the cosmic web, which may indicate that environment is important for the growth of SMBHs.

  High-redshift observations from JWST indicate that optical strong line ratios do not carry the same constraining power as they do at low redshifts. Critically, this prevents a separation between stellar- and black hole-driven ionizing radiation, thereby obscuring both active galactic nuclei demographics and star formation rates. To investigate this, we compute a large suite of photoionization models from Cloudy powered by stellar populations and accreting black holes over a large grid of ages, metallicities, initial mass functions, binarity, ionization parameters, densities, and black hole masses. We use these models to test three rest-frame optical strong line ratio diagnostics which have been designed to separate ionizing sources at low redshifts: the [NII]-BPT, VO87, and OHNO diagrams. We show that the position of a model in these diagrams is strongly driven by the ionization parameter (log U) and the gas-phase metallicity, often more so than the ionizing spectrum itself; in particular, there is significant overlap between stellar population and accreting black hole models at high log U and low Z. We show that the OHNO diagram is especially susceptible to large contamination of the AGN region defined at z=1 for stellar models with high log U and low Z, consistent with many observed JWST spectra at high redshift. We show that the optical line ratio diagnostics are most sensitive to the shape of the &lt;54 eV ionizing continuum, and that the derived ionizing sources for a given set of optical strong line ratios can be highly degenerate. Finally, we demonstrate that very high ionization (&gt;54 eV) emission lines that trace ionizing sources harder than normal stellar populations help to break the degeneracies present when using the strong line diagnostics alone, even in gas conditions consistent with those at high redshifts.

  We use JWST/NIRSpec observations of the radio galaxy 3C 293 to map the emission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well as stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by ~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the H$_2$2.12$\mu$m emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64$\mu$m and Pa$\alpha$. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk seen as a narrow component ($\sigma$ ~ 100 kms$^{-1}$); a blueshifted broad outflow ($\sigma$ ~ 250 kms$^{-1}$); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad component ($\sigma$ ~ 640 kms$^{-1}$). Extinction maps reveal high A$_V$ values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust lanes are detected in H$_2$ gas, with a mass inflow rate of $\dot{M}_{in}$ ~ 8 x 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the AGN accretion rate. For the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.14 $\pm$ 0.04 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (molecular) and 5.5 $\pm$ 1.44 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 4.5% of the jet power - enough to suppress star formation. Our results highlight 3C 293's turbulent post-merger history and JWST's unique capability to probe dust-obscured AGN.
