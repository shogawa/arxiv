  Galactic-wide outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a routinely invoked feedback mechanism in galaxy evolution models. Hitherto, the interplay among the interstellar gas on galactic scales, the propagation of AGN outflows and the fundamental AGN parameters during evolution remains elusive. Powerful nuclear outflows are found to favorably exist at early AGN stages usually associated with high accretion rates and weak narrow emission lines. In a sample of quasars emitting Mg II narrow absorption lines (NALs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we discover an unprecedented phenomenon where galaxy-scale inflow-dominated transforming into outflow-dominated gas accompanied by an increasing strength of the narrow [O III] line, at a confidence level of 6.7{\sigma}. The fact that nuclear outflows diminish while galaxy-wide outflows intensifies as AGNs evolve implies that early-stage outflows interact with interstellar medium on galactic scales and trigger the gradual transformation into galaxy-wide outflows, providing observational links to the hypothetical multi-stage propagation of AGN outflows that globally regulates galaxy evolution.

  We present NIRSpec/MSA observations from the JWST large-area survey WIDE, targeting the rest-frame UV-optical spectrum of Ulema, a radio-AGN host at redshift z=4.6348. The low-resolution prism spectrum displays high equivalent width nebular emission, with remarkably high ratios of low-ionisation species of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, relative to hydrogen; auroral O$^+$ emission is clearly detected, possibly also C$^+$. From the high-resolution grating spectrum, we measure a gas velocity dispersion $\sigma$~400 km s$^{-1}$, broad enough to rule out star-forming gas in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the galaxy. Emission-line ratio diagnostics suggest that the nebular emission is due to a shock which ran out of pre-shock gas. To infer the physical properties of the system, we model simultaneously the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) and shock-driven line emission under a Bayesian framework. We find a relatively low-mass, star-forming system (M* = 1.4$\times$10^{10} M$_\odot$, SFR = 70 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), where shock-driven emission contributes 50 per cent to the total H$\beta$ luminosity. The nebular metallicity is near solar - three times higher than that predicted by the mass-metallicity relation at z=4.6, possibly related to fast-paced chemical evolution near the galaxy nucleus. We find no evidence for a recent decline in the SFR of the galaxy, meaning that, already at this early epoch, fast radio-mode AGN feedback was poorly coupled with the bulk of the star-forming gas; therefore, most of the feedback energy must end up in the galaxy halo, setting the stage for future quenching.   

Cold fronts in galaxy clusters I: A case for the large-scale global
  eigen modes in unmagnetized and weakly magnetized cluster core

  Galaxy clusters show large-scale azimuthal X-ray surface brightness fluctuations known as cold fronts. These are overdense (average density jumps $\sim 30\%$ or post-jump density $\sim 130\%$) and have milder discontinuity in pressure. Cold fronts are argued to originate due to sloshing driven by sub-halo passage at close proximity to the cluster center. While this is a viable source of large-scale perturbations, the physical mechanisms that can sustain such density structures (of specific geometry) are not clear. In this work, we explore whether long wavelength thermal instability is an explanation for cold front formation in a cluster core which is perturbed by sub-halos or AGN activity. Using global linear perturbation analysis, we show that internal gravity waves (thermally unstable) can form large-scale three-dimensional spiral structures, akin to observed cold fronts. We explore if the presence of magnetic field (along spherical $\hat{\phi}$) may support such structures (by suppressing small scale Kelvin-Helmholtz modes) or disrupt them (by promoting additional thermal instability). We find that latter happens at shorter wavelengths and only at frequencies above the characteristic buoyancy or Brunt V\"ais\"al\"a frequency ($&gt;N_{\rm BV}$). Our work implies, firstly, that large-scale spirals may be formed and sustained over a long timescale ($&gt;N^{-1}_{\rm BV}$) even in presence of aligned magnetic fields that is otherwise supportive against mixing at the interface. Secondly, short-wavelength (but relatively longer along the field) unstable compressive modes may form within or in the vicinity of such spirals. The instability is an overstable slow wave, and grows in 2D at timescales $\gtrsim 2-3$ times longer than the spiral growth timescale (via thermal instability). Thus we claim that this instability cannot destroy the large scale coherence.
