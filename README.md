The observation of multiple images from a strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) source provides the observer with a stereoscopic view of the source. This allows for a measure of its relative proper motion by comparing the induced GW Doppler shifts between the different images. In addition, if the GW source is in a dynamical environment it will be subject to an acceleration, which will show up as a time dependent Doppler shift in each individual image. In this work we quantify for the first time how a joint detection of these effects can be used to constrain the underlying dynamics and environment of the lensed GW source. We consider a range of different astrophysical environments, from massive clusters to stellar triples, and find that binary black hole (BBH) mergers in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN-disks) are particularly likely to have orbital parameters that can be constrained through our considered lensing setup. Applying these methods to the upcoming catalog of cosmologically strongly lensed GW sources will open up new possibilities for probing their origin and underlying formation mechanisms.

Jets from stellar-mass and supermassive black holes provide the unique opportunity to study similar processes in two very different mass regimes. Historically, the apparent speeds of black hole x-ray binary (BHXRBs) jets have been observed to be lower than jet speeds from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and specifically blazars. In this work, we show that selection effects could be the primary cause of the observed population differences. For the first time, it is possible to perform a statistical analysis of the underlying BHXRB jet Lorentz factor distribution. We use both the Anderson-Darling test and apply nested sampling to this problem. With Bayes factors, we confirm that the Lorentz factor distribution of BHXRBs is best described with a power law, the same model that has been applied to AGN jets. For a Lorentz factor distribution following $\rm N(Γ) \propto Γ^b$ we find a value for the exponent of $b=-2.64_{-0.55}^{+0.46}$. This exponent is consistent with values found in AGN population studies, within $1σ$ for \textit{Swift}-BAT and \textit{Fermi}-LAT selected AGN. The best-fit exponent for the radio selected MOJAVE sample is just above our $2 σ$ limit. This is a remarkable agreement given the different scales at which the jets are observed. The observed slower apparent speeds in BHXRBs are largely due to the much larger inclinations in this sample. Furthermore, nested sampling confirms that $Γ_{\rm max}$ is completely unconstrained using this method. Therefore, based on kinematics alone, BHXRB jets are broadly consistent with being just as relativistic as those from supermassive black holes.

The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (|Delta v| &lt;= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 &lt; 0.02) and high (z0 &gt;= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma &lt; 0.05), filament (0.05 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 0.5), group (0.5 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 2.0), and cluster (Sigma &gt;= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z &lt; 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma_3D &lt; 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z &gt; 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.

We present a comprehensive analysis of 475 ks (438 ks unpublished &amp; 37 ks archival) XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn observation of a nearby, highly inclined, star-forming, luminous infrared galaxy NGC 3221 through spatial, temporal, and spectral information. We confirm the presence of a low-luminosity (presumably Compton-thick) AGN. The 0.4$-$12 keV luminosity and the hardness ratio of the six ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULX) previously identified in Chandra data exhibit diverse variability on day-scale. The collective emission from unresolved sources exhibits a different day-scale variability. We have also discovered two new predominantly soft ($&lt;1$ keV) sources. One of these has an enigmatic spectral shape featuring a soft component, which we interpret as a superbubble in NGC 3221, and a variable hard component from a compact object, which is unresolved from the superbubble. We do not confidently detect any X-ray emission from SN 1961L. The hot gas in the ISM (out to $\pm$6 kpc from the disk plane) and the extraplanar region (6$-$12 kpc) both require two thermal phases at $\sim 0.15$ keV and $\sim 0.55$ keV. The $\sim 0.55$ keV component is fainter in the ISM than the $\sim 0.15$ keV component, but the emission from the latter falls off more steeply with disk height than the former. This makes the extraplanar region hotter and less dense than the ISM. The proximity of NGC 3221 and the occurrence of the underluminous AGN offer a unique observing opportunity to study the hot diffuse medium in conjunction with nuclear and disk-wide point sources.

The inner stellar mass surface density within 1 kpc, Sigma1, has emerged as a suitable proxy for bulge growth and galaxy quenching. However, the dependence of cold gas content on Sigma1 has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we examine the relationship between Sigma1, as well as the mass-relative parameter delSigma1, and the atomic (fHI) and molecular (fH2) cold gas fractions in massive, nearby galaxies. We utilize a sample of 341 galaxies with HI data and 201 galaxies with H2 data from the xGASS and xCOLDGASS surveys, spanning 0.02 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.05 and a stellar mass range of 10^10 &lt;= M_*/M_odot &lt;= 10^11.5. While we observe that a decline in both fHI and fH2 is associated with increasing Sigma1, we find that fH2 shows a sharper decline above a threshold value of delSigma1 = 0. In addition, the fraction of galaxies with AGN activity (Seyferts and LINERs) increases with delSigma1, with the greatest increase occurring between 0 &lt;= delSigma1 &lt;= 0.2 dex. We propose an evolutionary track in the plane of fH2-delSigma1, whereby molecular gas depletion at fixed mass coincides with a rise in AGN activity. Our results suggest that central bulge growth is more tightly coupled to the depletion of molecular gas rather than atomic gas, with AGN feedback possibly contributing to this process. Our work highlights the utility of Sigma1 and delSigma1 as tracers of quenching in massive galaxies.

Following the detection of a radio-loud Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in the z=4.3 protocluster SPT2349-56, we have obtained additional observations with MeerKAT in S-band (2.4 GHz) with the aim of further characterizing radio emission from amongst the ~30 submillimeter (submm) galaxies (SMGs) identified in the structure. We newly identify three of the protocluster SMGs individually at 2.4GHz as having a radio-excess, two of which are now known to be X-ray luminous AGN. Two additional members are also detected with radio emission consistent with their star formation rate (SFR). Archival MeerKAT UHF (816 MHz) observations further constrain luminosities and radio spectral indices of these five galaxies. The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) is used to detect and resolve the central two sources at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz finding elongated, jet-like morphologies. The excess radio luminosities range from L1.4,rest = (1-20)x10^25 W/Hz, ~10-100x higher than expected from the SFRs, assuming the usual far-infrared-radio correlation. Of the known cluster members, only the SMG `N1' shows signs of AGN in any other diagnostics, namely a large and compact excess in CO(11-10) line emission. We compare these results to field samples of radio sources and SMGs. The overdensity of radio-loud AGN in the compact core region of the cluster may be providing significant heating to the recently discovered nascent intra-cluster medium (ICM) in SPT2349-56.
