  The 4D eigenvector 1 (E1) sequence has emerged as a powerful tool for organizing the observational and physical characteristics of type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the metallicity of the broad line region gas, incorporating both new data and previously published findings, to assess the presence of any trend along the sequence. We perform a multi-component analysis on the strongest UV and optical emission lines, compute $\sim 10$ diagnostic ratios, and compare them with the prediction of CLOUDY photoionization simulations, identifying a photoionization solution closest to the data. Our investigation reveals a consistent pattern along the optical plane of the E1. We observe a systematic progression in metallicity, ranging from sub-solar values to metallicity levels several times higher than solar values. These findings underscore the role of metallicity as a fundamental correlate of the 4DE1/main sequence. Extreme values of metallicity, at least several tens solar, are confirmed in low-$z$ AGNs radiating at a high Eddington ratio, although the origin of the extreme enrichment remains open to debate.

  It is believed that dual active galactic nuclei (dual AGN) will form during galaxies merge. Studying dual-AGN emission can provide valuable insights into galaxy merging and evolution. To investigate parsec-scale radio emission properties, we observed eight radio components of four selected dual-AGN systems using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 5 GHz in multiple-phase-center mode. Among them, two compact radio components, labeled J0051+0020B and J2300-0005A, were detected clearly on parsec scales for the first time. However, the radio emission of the other six components was resolved out in the high-resolution images. We provided the values or upper limits of the brightness temperature and radio emission power, and analyzed the emission origins in detail for each target. Based on their physical properties reported in this work and in the literature, we suggest the radio emission in J0051+0020B and J2300-0005A originates primarily from compact jets, while the other six sources show more complex emission mechanisms. In addition, our VLBA observations suggest the systematic X-ray deficit in our dual-AGN sample is likely attributed to the tidally induced effect and possible viewing angle effect.

  Feedback is the key physical mechanism regulating galaxy formation. Stars in galaxies form when baryons radiatively cool down and fall into gravitational wells. Eventually, star formation quenches as gas is depleted and/or perturbed by feedback processes, no longer being able to collapse and condense. For massive galaxies, astronomers identify feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (active galactic nuclei, AGN) as the main agent responsible for quenching. We report the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of a massive, completely quiescent galaxy at $z=3.714$ (Jekyll) and its neighborhood. Jekyll is part of a galaxy pair with a compact, dusty, massive star-forming companion (Hyde). We find large amounts of ionized and neutral gas in the intergalactic medium around the pair, yet Jekyll has remained quiescent for more than 500~Myr. The emitting gas is consistent with AGN photoionization, but no AGN is observed in Jekyll. We find that, in contrast to standard scenarios, AGN in satellite galaxies can be critical contributors for keeping massive galaxies quiescent in the early Universe. After the accelerated formation and quenching of the massive central galaxy, tidally induced gas stripping additionally contributes to the star-formation regulation on subsequent satellite galaxy generations.
