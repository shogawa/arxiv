  Within the deep gravitational potential of galaxy clusters lies the intracluster medium (ICM). At the first order, it is considered to be at hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well. However, evidence is growing that the ICM dynamics is non-negligible, is mostly turbulent in origin, and provides a non-thermal pressure support to the equilibrium. In this work, we intend to characterise the properties of the velocity field in the ICM of a simulated replica of the Virgo cluster. We first study the 3D and projected properties of the ICM velocity field by computing its probability density functions (PDFs) and its statistical moments. We then estimate the non-thermal pressure fraction from an effective turbulent Mach number, including the velocity dispersion. We finally compute the velocity structure function (VSF) from projected maps of the sightline velocity. We first show that the components of the 3D velocity field and the projected quantities along equivalent sightlines are anisotropic and affected by the accretion of gas from filaments. Then, we compare the mean statistical moments of the 3D velocity field to the mean properties of a hundred random projections. We show, in particular, an almost linear relation between the standard deviation estimated from direct simulation outputs and sightline velocity dispersion projections, comparable to the line broadening of X-ray atomic lines. However, this linear relation does not hold between the direct simulation outputs and the standard deviation of the sightline velocity projections, comparable to the line shift of X-ray atomic lines. We find a non-thermal pressure fraction around $6\%$ within $R_{500}$ and $9\%$ within $R_{vir}$ from sightline velocity dispersion, which is in good agreement with direct simulation outputs. Finally, we show that the VSF might probe the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback turbulent injection scale.

  Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions (QPEs) are a new class of repeating nuclear transient in which repeating X-ray flares are observed coming from the nuclei of generally low mass galaxies. Here we present a comprehensive summary of the radio properties of 12 bona-fide quasi-periodic eruption sources, including a mix of known tidal disruption events (TDEs) and AGN-like hosts. We include a combination of new dedicated radio observations and archival/previously published radio observations to compile a catalogue of radio observations of each source in the sample. We examine the overall radio properties of the sample and compare to the radio properties of known TDEs, given the apparent link between QPEs and TDEs. Overall we find compact, weak radio sources associated with 5/12 of the QPE sources and no signatures of strong AGN activity via a luminous radio jet. We find no radio variability or correlation between radio emission and the X-ray QPE properties, implying that the mechanism that produces the X-ray flares does not generate strong radio-emitting outflows. The compactness of the radio sources and lack of correlation between radio luminosity and SMBH mass is very unusual for AGN, but the radio spectra and luminosities are consistent with outflows produced by a recent TDE (or accretion event), in both the known TDE sources as well as the AGN-like sources in the sample.

  We have analyzed a sample of 2MIG isolated galaxies hosting AGNs (isolated AGNs) to assess whether their nuclear activity differs from that in a denser environment. The isolation criteria rule out interactions with other galaxies of similar size for at least $\sim$3 Gyr. We systemized the available Swift, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and INTEGRAL X-ray data for isolated AGN at $z&lt;0.05$, determining their general X-ray properties and peculiarities, spectral models, SMBH masses, and possible parameter correlations. We investigated the best spectral models of 25 isolated AGNs, including 10 recently fitted in this work. The intrinsic luminosities $\log L_{2-10,\mathrm{keV}}$ do not exceed $\sim43$.   Our results indicate that the isolation of galaxies in the nearby Universe does not significantly affect nuclear activity. This is confirmed by the diversity of accretion types and the absence of any advantage of one particular basic/compound spectral model. We note an interesting case discovered for the ESO499-041 spectrum, where the data-to-model ratio shows significant changes after 6.4 keV. These deviations from the continuum may indicate the presence of a relativistic Iron line in the Chandra spectrum of ESO 499-041 compared to the Swift spectrum. Most isolated AGNs contain SMBH with $M_{\mathrm{SMBH}} \leq 10^7,M_{\odot}$. For the first time, we found a linear correlation between $L_{2-10,\mathrm{keV}}$ and $\log M_{\mathrm{SMBH}}$ that is not observed in other AGN samples. This trend may be affected by the limited sample size and requires further confirmation with larger datasets. Finally, we identified UGC10120, NG6300, and CGCG243-024 as promising candidates for Milky Way analogues.

  Purpose: We aim to investigate an accretion disk (AD) temperature profile of a doubly lensed quasar SBS 1520+530. Temperature profiles of accretion disks are known to be diagnostic of many of the physical properties of AGNs and quasars. Methods: Our approach involves application of the photometric reverberation mapping to the light curves of SBS 1520+530 obtained in the Johnson-Cousins V and R filters. The RM method implies that the time shift between the light curves taken in different spectral ranges determines the light travel time between the AD zones with different physical conditions. In determining the time shifts, we applied a method based on some useful properties of the orthogonal polynomials. Results: The variations in filter R lag those in filter V , with 1.25$\pm$ 0.63 days for the inter-band time shift averaged between the two image components and over the three seasons. The obtained time lag noticeably exceeds the value following for SBS 1520+530 from the classical model of optically thick geometrically thin AD. We considered two possible ways to resolve the discrepancy between the theory and observations. The first assumes an AD temperature profile flatter than the classical one. The second way is to consider an extended optically thick scattering envelope originated due to matter outflow from an AD interior. Conclusion: Both explanations may be consequences of the super-Eddington accretion in SBS 1520+530. Using bolometric luminosity estimates available for SBS 1520+530 from the literature, we obtained a value of $\approx$ 3.4 for the Eddington ratio, which indeed indicates a moderately super-Eddington accretion regime.

  Supermassive black hole feedback is the currently favoured mechanism to regulate the star formation rate of galaxies and prevent the formation of ultra-massive galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{12}M_\odot$). However, the mechanism through which the outflowing energy is transferred to the surrounding medium strongly varies from one galaxy evolution model to another, such that a unified model for AGN feedback does not currently exist. The hot atmospheres of galaxy groups are highly sensitive laboratories of the feedback process, as the injected black hole energy is comparable to the binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we report multi-wavelength observations of the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436. The hot atmosphere of this system exhibits a highly relaxed morphology centred on the giant elliptical galaxy NGC~3298. The X-ray emission from the system features a compact core ($&lt;$10 kpc) and a steep increase in the entropy and cooling time of the gas, with the cooling time reaching the age of the Universe $\sim15$ kpc from the centre of the galaxy. The observed entropy profile implies a total injected energy of $\sim1.5\times10^{61}$ ergs, which given the high level of relaxation could not have been injected by a recent merging event. Star formation in the central galaxy NGC~3298 is strongly quenched and its stellar population is very old ($\sim$10.6 Gyr). The currently detected radio jets have low power and are confined within the central compact core. All the available evidence implies that this system was affected by giant AGN outbursts which excessively heated the neighbouring gas and prevented the formation of a self-regulated feedback cycle. Our findings imply that AGN outbursts can be energetic enough to unbind gas particles and lead to the disruption of cool cores.

  We predict the non-thermal pressure (NTP) induced in the cores of galaxy clusters by kinetic jet feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We model a population of Fanaroff-Riley type I jets when sampling power-law distributions in jet power and age, which we evolve in time with a two-phase jet-lobe model. We couple the energy of each jet outburst to the surrounding gas inside spherical shells, allowing us to estimate the fraction of NTP to total pressure induced in the cluster. We predict the mean profile for this NTP fraction over the source population in a variety of cluster environments and for different AGN jet duty cycles. For typical gas and dark matter profiles, the mean NTP fraction peaks at ~4-6% when the AGN jets are active for 10-30% of the total AGN lifecycle. These predictions are in good agreement with observational constraints, suggesting that AGN feedback imparts only small non-thermal contributions to the cluster's core. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the peak in the mean NTP fraction and the AGN jet duty cycle in a given cluster environment. Applying this to Hitomi measurements of the NTP in the Perseus cluster, we infer an AGN jet duty cycle that is consistent with independent evidence of Perseus' AGN jet activity. We propose this as a novel approach for observationally inferring the past AGN activity of real clusters from their observed NTP fraction and environmental profiles.
