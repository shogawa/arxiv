  A common feature of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is their random variations in brightness across the whole emission spectrum, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Studying the nature and origin of these fluctuations is critical to characterising the underlying variability process of the accretion flow that powers AGN. Random timing fluctuations are often studied with the power spectrum; this quantifies how the amplitude of variations is distributed over temporal frequencies. Red noise variability -- when the power spectrum increases smoothly towards low frequencies -- is ubiquitous in AGN. The commonly used Fourier analysis methods, have significant challenges when applied to arbitrarily sampled light curves of red noise variability. Several time-domain methods exist to infer the power spectral shape in the case of irregular sampling but they suffer from biases which can be difficult to mitigate, or are computationally expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate a method infer the shape of broad-band power spectra for irregular time series, using a Gaussian process regression method scalable to large datasets. The power spectrum is modelled as a power-law model with one or two bends with flexible slopes. The method is fully Bayesian and we demonstrate its utility using simulated light curves. Finally, Ark 564, a well-known variable Seyfert 1 galaxy, is used as a test case and we find consistent results with the literature using independent X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Swift. We provide publicly available, documented and tested implementations in Python and Julia.

  We present the statistical properties of Ly$\alpha$ emission in 586 galaxies at $z=4.5-14.2$, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions from $z\sim 5$ to $z\sim 10-14$ with the observed Ly$\alpha$ EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a $\sim3$ dex decrease in number density at $L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}=10^{42}-10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over the redshift range. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of $x_\mathrm{HI}=0.17_{-0.16}^{+0.23}$, $0.63_{-0.28}^{+0.18}$, $0.79_{-0.21}^{+0.13}$, and $0.88_{-0.13}^{+0.11}$ at $z\sim6$, $7$, $8-9$, and $10-14$, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly$\alpha$, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high $x_\mathrm{HI}$ values over $z\sim 7-14$ suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at $z\sim 6-7$. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at $z\sim 6-7$.

  We report the analysis of ~1Ms of XMM-Newton observations of the rapidly accreting active galactic nucleus REJ1034+396. The 0.3-9 keV EPIC-pn spectra are well described by a model consisting of steep continuum emission from the corona accompanied by relativistically-blurred reflection from a highly ionized accretion disk. The source is known to exhibit strong excess soft X-ray emission, which we show is well represented by thermal disk photons Comptonized by a warm plasma spanning the inner accretion flow. Additionally, the EPIC-pn data provide compelling evidence ($\Delta C\sim60$ for 4 additional parameters) for the presence of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a line-of-sight velocity $v/c=0.307^{+0.001}_{-0.005}$, and an emission signature consistent with reflection of the corona from modestly ionized, outflowing gas. The simultaneous $0.5-2.5$\,keV RGS spectra show clear absorption lines. Modelling of these data confirms the presence of the UFO and constrains its equivalent hydrogen column density, log $N_\mathrm{H}/$(atom cm$^{-2}$) = $21.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$. The RGS data also reveal at least two warm absorber components with a modest outflow velocity ($1680^{+40}_{-50}$ km/s). The measured properties and time evolution of the UFO in REJ1034+396 suggest that it is formed from collisionally ionized plasma, launched from the disk surface and accelerated by radiation pressure. The high terminal velocity and substantial absorbing column density imply that the outflow carries sufficient momentum and energy to transform its environment, being capable of driving out essentially all dust and gas it interacts with along the line of sight, even if the AGN were initially surrounded by a Compton thick absorber.

  The 2017 observing campaign of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) delivered the first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images at the observing frequency of 230 GHz, leading to a number of unique studies on black holes and relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN). In total, eighteen sources were observed: the main science targets, Sgr A* and M87 along with various calibrators. We investigated the morphology of the sixteen AGN in the EHT 2017 data set, focusing on the properties of the VLBI cores: size, flux density, and brightness temperature. We studied their dependence on the observing frequency in order to compare it with the Blandford-K\"onigl (BK) jet model. We modeled the source structure of seven AGN in the EHT 2017 data set using linearly polarized circular Gaussian components and collected results for the other nine AGN from dedicated EHT publications, complemented by lower frequency data in the 2-86 GHz range. Then, we studied the dependences of the VLBI core flux density, size, and brightness temperature on the frequency measured in the AGN host frame. We compared the observations with the BK jet model and estimated the magnetic field strength dependence on the distance from the central black hole. Our results indicate a deviation from the standard BK model, particularly in the decrease of the brightness temperature with the observing frequency. Either bulk acceleration of the jet material, energy transfer from the magnetic field to the particles, or both are required to explain the observations.

  The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an ''ionization cone'' that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon ($z\sim2-3$), measurements which were previously only well-studied at $z\sim0$ with IFU spectroscopy. To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at $z=2-3$ created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby ($z&lt;0.05$) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at $z=2-3$ with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III] emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at $z=2.4-3.4$ in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III] morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of $1-2.5$ kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN Luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of $\sim 2$.   

XRISM reveals low non-thermal pressure in the core of the hot, relaxed

  We present XRISM Resolve observations of the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029. We find that the line-of-sight bulk velocity of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the central 180 kpc is at rest with respect to the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, with a 3-sigma upper limit of |v_bulk| &lt; 100 km/s. We robustly measure the field-integrated ICM velocity dispersion to be sigma_v = 169 +/- 10 km/s, obtaining similar results for both single-temperature and two-temperature plasma models to account for the cluster cool core. This result, if ascribed to isotropic turbulence, implies a subsonic ICM with Mach number M_3D ~ 0.21 and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 2%. The turbulent velocity is similar to what was measured in the core of the Perseus cluster by Hitomi, but here in a more massive cluster with an ICM temperature of 7 keV, the limit on non-thermal pressure fraction is even more stringent. Our result is consistent with expectations from simulations of relaxed clusters, but it is on the low end of the predicted distribution, indicating that Abell 2029 is an exceptionally relaxed cluster with no significant impacts from either a recent minor merger or AGN activity.
