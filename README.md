  Mergers are fundamental to our understanding of the processes driving the evolution of the structure and morphology of galaxies, star formation, AGN activity, and the redistribution of stellar mass in the Universe. Determining the fraction and properties of mergers across cosmic time is critical to understanding the formation of the Universe we observe today. This fraction and its evolution also provide inputs and constraints for cosmological simulations, crucial for theoretical models of galaxy evolution. We present robust estimates of major close-pair fractions and merger rates at $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$ in the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). We identify major mergers by selecting close-pairs with a projected spatial separation $r_{\mathrm{sep}} &lt; 20$ h$^{-1}$ kpc and a radial velocity separation $v_{\mathrm{sep}} &lt; 500$ km s$^{-1}$. For galaxies with stellar masses of log$_{10}$($M_\star$/$M_\odot$) = 10.66 $\pm$ 0.25 dex, we find a major close-pair fraction of $\approx 0.021$ at $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.34$ using a highly complete, unbiased spectroscopic sample. We extend these estimates to $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$ by combining the full probability distribution of redshifts for galaxies with high-quality spectroscopic, photometric, or grism measurements. Fitting a power-law $\gamma_{m} = A(1 + z)^m$, we find $A = 0.024 \pm 0.001$ and $m = 0.55 \pm 0.22$. Consistent with previous results, the shallow slope suggests weak redshift evolution in the merger fraction. When comparing with large hydrodynamical simulations, we also find consistent results. We convert close-pair fractions to merger rates using several literature prescriptions for merger timescales and provide all measurements for future studies.

  We preform a systematic search for galactic-scale quasar pairs and small-scale (&lt;3 arcsec) lenses using the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog and Gaia DR3. Candidate double quasars (both are unobscured) are identified as Gaia resolved pairs around spectroscopically confirmed SDSS quasars ($L_{\rm bol} &gt; 10^{44.5} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$) at $0.5 &lt; z \lesssim 4.5$. Gaia astrometric information and SDSS spectral decomposition are used to exclude foreground star superpositions, which dominate ($\gtrsim 80\%$ of) the pair sample. We identify $136$ double quasar candidates from $1120$ Gaia-resolved pairs after a magnitude and redshift cut of $G&lt;20.5$ and $z&gt;0.5$ (803 double quasars out of 2,497 pairs without any cuts applied) with separations of $\sim$ 0.3 - 3 arcsec, corresponding to projected physical separations of $\sim$ 3 - 30 kpc at the median redshift of the sample of $z = 1.7$. We estimate an overall double quasar (lens and physical pairs combined) fraction using this sample, corrected for pair-resolving completeness, of $5.7_{-0.3}^{+0.3} \times 10^{-4}$ (bootstrapping errors). This double quasar fraction increases toward smaller separations, consistent with earlier findings. We also find little redshift evolution of the double quasar fraction for the luminous SDSS sample, consistent with previous observations and simulation predictions. However, the observed fraction is lower than simulation predictions by $\sim$0.8 - 1.6 dex, suggesting a significant population of obscured quasar pairs are missed in our search. Future wide-area space missions targeting both unobscured and obscured quasar pairs at sub-arcsec resolutions will reveal this population of obscured quasar pairs, and extend to much lower AGN luminosities.

  We present MACER3D (Multiscale AGN-regulated Cosmic Ecosystem Resolver in 3D), a new suite of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that study active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on galactic scales over Gyr duration, with major enhancement in subgrid models and gas physics over its predecessor -- MACER (Massive AGN Controlled Ellipticals Resolved) which is in two dimensions (hereafter MACER2D). MACER3D resolves gas dynamics from within the Bondi radius ($\sim 25\,\mathrm{pc}$) to halo scales. Combined with black hole accretion theory, it enables an accurate calculation of AGN outputs and subsequently their large-scale feedback effects. We present results from simulating an isolated elliptical galaxy with different feedback configurations. In the fiducial model with both AGN and supernova (SN) feedback, the temporal evolution of AGN luminosity and star formation rate are strongly correlated, suggesting shared dependence on the availability of gas supply for SMBH accretion and star formation. AGN duty cycles of several percent with a single-cycle timescale of $\sim 10^2\,\mathrm{Myr}$ agree with observations, while models with only AGN or SN feedback fail to reproduce observed cycles. While all models maintain a quiescent galaxy state, fiducial AGN+SN feedback model results in higher star formation than no-SN feedback, suggesting SN feedback, when acting synergistically with AGN feedback, may positively impact star formation. Combined AGN and SN feedback enhances halo-scale metal enrichment compared to single-feedback models. The simulated X-ray properties match observations and predict transient cavities produced by cold-mode AGN winds from past burst events. The differences between the results obtained by MACER2D and MACER3D are also discussed.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) can accelerate protons to energies of $\sim$ 10-100 TeV, with secondary production of high-energy neutrinos. If the acceleration is driven by magnetized turbulence, the main properties of the resulting proton and neutrino spectra can be deduced based on insights from particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence. We have previously shown that these properties are consistent with the TeV~neutrino signal observed from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. In this work, we extend this result to a population study. We show that the produced neutrino flux depends mainly on the energetics of the corona -- the relative fraction of X-ray, magnetic, and non-thermal proton energy -- and on the spectral energy distribution of the AGN. We find that coronae with similar properties can explain neutrinos from the candidate AGN for which IceCube has reported an excess, albeit less significant than NGC 1068. Building on this framework, we show how the neutrino signal evolves with the AGN luminosity, and use this AGN sequence to predict the diffuse neutrino flux from the extragalactic population, showing that it can account for the diffuse neutrino signal observed by IceCube in the $\sim$1-100 TeV energy range.

  Broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disks has been widely accepted to explain the unique double-peaked broad emission lines in Active Galactic Nuclei (double-peaked BLAGNs). Here, accepted the accretion disk origin, periodic variations of central wavelength $\lambda_{0}$ (the first moment) and line width $\sigma$ (the second moment) of double-peaked broad emission lines are theoretically simulated and determined. Furthermore, through theoretically simulated periodicities of $T_{\lambda0}$ and $T_{\sigma}$ for variations of $\lambda_0$ and $\sigma$, periodicity ratio $R_{fs}$ of $T_{\lambda0}$ to $T_{\sigma}$ to be around 2 can be applied to support the spiral arms to be more preferred in BLRs lying into central accretion disks. Then, periodic variations of $\lambda_0$ and $\sigma$ are determined and shown in the known double-peaked BLAGN NGC1097, leading to the parameter $R_{fs}\sim2$, which can be applied as clues to support that the structure of spiral arms in disk-like BLRs in central accretion disk should be the most compelling interpretation to the variability of double-peaked broad H$\alpha$ in NGC1097. The results provide clean criteria to test accretion disk origins of double-peaked broad emission lines in AGN.
