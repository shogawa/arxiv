  With the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), extra-galactic source count studies were conducted down to sub-microJy in the mid-infrared (MIR), which is several tens of times fainter than what the previous-generation infrared (IR) telescopes achieved in the MIR. In this work, we aim to interpret the JWST source counts and constrain cosmic star-formation history (CSFH) and black hole accretion history (BHAH). We employ the backward evolution of local luminosity functions (LLFs) of galaxies to reproduce the observed source counts from sub-microJy to a few tens of mJy in the MIR bands of the JWST. The shapes of the LLFs at the MIR bands are determined using the model templates of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for five representative galaxy types (star-forming galaxies, starbursts, composite, AGN type 2 and 1). By simultaneously fitting our model to all the source counts in the six MIR bands, along with the previous results, we determine the best-fit evolutions of MIR LFs for each of the five galaxy types, and subsequently estimate the CSFH and BHAH. Thanks to the JWST, our estimates are based on several tens of times fainter MIR sources, the existence of which was merely an extrapolation in previous studies.

  The study of jet launching in AGN is an important research method to better understand supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their immediate surroundings. The main theoretical jet launching scenarios invoke either magnetic field lines anchored to the black hole's (BH) accretion disc (Blandford &amp; Payne 1982) or a magnetic field, which is directly connected to its rotating ergosphere (Blandford &amp; Znajek 1977). The nearby and bright radio galaxy 3C84 (NGC1275) is a very suitable target for testing different jet launching mechanisms, as well as for the study of the innermost, sub-parsec scale AGN structure and the jet origin. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) - specifically at millimetre wavelengths - offers an unparalleled view into the physical processes in action, in the close vicinity of SMBHs. Utilising such mm-VLBI observations of 3C84, we study the jet kinematics of the VLBI core region of 3C84 by employing all available, high sensitivity 3 mm-VLBI data sets of this source. As part of this analysis we associate the component ejection events with the variability light-curves at different radio frequencies and in the $\gamma$-rays. Furthermore, by cross-correlating these light-curves, we determine their time-lags and draw conclusions regarding the location of the high energy emission close to the jet base.

  The enormous increase in mid-IR sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution provided by the JWST spectrographs enables, for the first time, detailed extragalactic studies of molecular vibrational bands. This opens an entirely new window for the study of the molecular interstellar medium in luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs). We present a detailed analysis of rovibrational bands of gas-phase CO, H$_2$O, C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN towards the heavily-obscured eastern nucleus of the LIRG VV 114, as observed by NIRSpec and MIRI MRS. Spectra extracted from apertures of 130 pc in radius show a clear dichotomy between the obscured AGN and two intense starburst regions. We detect the 2.3 $\mu$m CO bandheads, characteristic of cool stellar atmospheres, in the star-forming regions, but not towards the AGN. Surprisingly, at 4.7 $\mathrm{\mu}$m we find highly-excited CO ($T_\mathrm{ex} \approx 700$ K; 1000 K out to at least rotational level $J = 27$) towards the star-forming regions, but only cooler gas ($T_\mathrm{ex} \approx 170$ K) towards the AGN. We conclude that only mid-infrared pumping through the rovibrational lines can account for the equilibrium conditions found for CO and H$_2$O in the deeply-embedded starbursts. Here the CO bands probe regions with an intense local radiation field inside dusty young massive star clusters or near the most massive young stars. The lack of high-excitation molecular gas towards the AGN is attributed to geometric dilution of the intense radiation from the bright point source. An overview of the relevant excitation and radiative transfer physics is provided in an appendix.

  Spitzer spectral maps reveal a disk of highly luminous, warm (&gt;150 K) H2 in the center of the massive spiral galaxy Messier 58, which hosts a radio-loud AGN. The inner 2.6 kpc of the galaxy appears to be overrun by shocks from the radio jet cocoon. Gemini NIRI imaging of the H2 1-0 S(1) emission line, ALMA CO 2-1, and HST multiband imagery indicate that much of the molecular gas is shocked in-situ, corresponding to lanes of dusty molecular gas that spiral towards the galaxy nucleus. The CO 2-1 and ionized gas kinematics are highly disturbed, with velocity dispersion up to 300 km/s. Dissipation of the associated kinetic energy and turbulence, likely injected into the ISM by radio-jet driven outflows, may power the observed molecular and ionized gas emission from the inner disk. The PAH fraction and composition in the inner disk appear to be normal, in spite of the jet and AGN activity. The PAH ratios are consistent with excitation by the interstellar radiation field from old stars in the bulge, with no contribution from star formation. The phenomenon of jet-shocked H2 may substantially reduce star formation and help to regulate the stellar mass of the inner disk and supermassive black hole in this otherwise normal spiral galaxy. Similarly strong H2 emission is found at the centers of several nearby spiral and lenticular galaxies with massive bulges and radio-loud AGN.

  Ionization cones and relativistic jets give us one of the most large-scale example of active galactic nuclei (AGN) influence on the surrounding gas environment in galaxies and beyond. The study of ionization cones makes it possible not only to test the predictions of the unified model of galactic activity, but also to probe galaxy gas environment and trace how the luminosity of the nucleus changes over time (a light echo). In the external galactic or even extragalactic gas ionization cones create Extended Emission-Line Regions (EELRs) which can span distances from several to hundreds kpc away a host galaxy. We review the recent results of studying the gas kinematics and its ionization properties in EELRs with a special attention to search of fading AGN radiation on the time scale $\mbox{few}\times(10^4-10^5)$ yr. The role of modern narrow-band and integral-field surveys in these researches is also considered.

  We develop the recipe to separate the spectral counterparts of the AGN NGC 1275 from the emission of the Perseus cluster surrounding it in the spectra observed by Suzaku/XIS cameras with no usage of the spectral fitting models. The Perseus cluster emission reaches higher energies than is typical for the most AGN-situated dense surroundings (i.e. up to 9-10 keV). That is why the separation between the AGN and cluster spectra is especially important in this case. To avoid the degeneracy due to the huge quantity of the spectral fitting parameters such as abundances of elements the cluster consists of, thermal and Compton emission of the nucleus itself, and the jet SSC/IC emission spectral parameters as well we prefer to avoid the spectral fitting usage to perform this task. Instead, we use the spatial resolution of the components and double background subtracting. For this purpose we choose the following regions to collect all the photons from them: (1) circular or square-shaped region around the source (AGN); (2) ring-shaped (or non-overlapped square) region surrounding the AGN (for cluster); (3) remote empty circular region for the background. Having collected the photons from those regions we subtract the background (i.e. photons from the third region) from the source and cluster spectra. Next, we subtract the re-normalized cluster counts from the AGN spectrum; using the relation between the emission line amplitudes in the AGN and cluster spectra as the renormalization coefficient. We have performed this procedure on the whole set of the Suzaku/XIS observational data for NGC 1275 to obtain the cleaned spectra and light curve of the AGN emission in this system.

  Gas accretion by a galaxy's central super massive black hole (SMBH) and the resultant energetic feedback by the accreting active galactic nucleus (AGN) on the gas in and around a galaxy, are two tightly intertwined but competing processes that play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies. Observations of galaxy clusters have shown how the plasma jets emitted by the AGN heat the intra-cluster medium (ICM), preventing cooling of the cluster gas and thereby the infall of this gas onto the central galaxy. On the other hand, outflows of multi-phase gas, driven by the jets, can cool as they rise into the ICM, leading to filaments of colder gas. The fate of this cold gas is unclear, but it has been suggested it plays a role in feeding the central SMBH. We present the results of re-processed CO(2-1) ALMA observations of the cold molecular gas in the central regions of NGC 1275, the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster and hosting the radio-loud AGN 3C 84 (Perseus A). These data show, for the first time, in detail how kpc-sized cold gas filaments resulting from jet-induced cooling of cluster gas are flowing towards the galaxy centre and how they feed the circumnuclear accretion disc (100 pc diameter) of the SMBH. Thus, cooled gas can, in this way, play a role in feeding the AGN. These results complete our view of the feedback loop of how an AGN can impact on its surroundings and how the effects from this impact maintain the AGN activity.
