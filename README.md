  We present JWST/MIRI MRS spatially resolved $\sim 5-28\,\mu$m observations of the central ~4-8kpc of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy and broad absorption line quasar Mrk231. These are part of the Mid-Infrared Characterization of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) program of the MIRI European Consortium guaranteed time observations. No high excitation lines (i.e., [MgV] at 5.61$\mu$m or [NeV] at 14.32$\mu$m) typically associated with the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) are detected in the nuclear region of Mrk231. This is likely due to the intrinsically X-ray weak nature of its quasar. Some intermediate ionization potential lines, for instance, [ArIII] at 8.99$\mu$m and [SIV] at 10.51$\mu$m, are not detected either, even though they are clearly observed in a star-forming region ~920pc south-east of the AGN. Thus, the strong nuclear mid-infrared (mid-IR) continuum is also in part hampering the detection of faint lines in the nuclear region. The nuclear [NeIII]/[NeII]line ratio is consistent with values observed in star-forming galaxies. Moreover, we resolve for the first time the nuclear starburst in the mid-IR low-excitation line emission (size of ~400pc, FWHM). Several pieces of evidence also indicate that it is partly obscured even at these wavelengths. At the AGN position, the ionized and warm molecular gas emission lines have modest widths (W_80~300km/s). There are, however, weak blueshifted wings reaching velocities v_02~-400km/s in [NeII]. The nuclear starburst is at the center of a large (~8kpc), massive rotating disk with widely-spread, low velocity outflows. Given the high star formation rate of Mrk231, we speculate that part of the nuclear outflows and the large-scale non-circular motions observed in the mid-IR are driven by its powerful nuclear starburst.

  Giant (&gt;100 kpc) nebulae associated with active galaxies provide rich information about the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies, its link with the interstellar medium (ISM) of the hosts and the mechanisms involved in their evolution. We have studied the giant nebula associated with the Teacup (z=0.085) quasar based on VLT MUSE integral field spectroscopy with two main scientific aims: to investigate whether the well known giant (10 kpc) AGN induced outflow has an impact on the distribution of heavy elements in and outside the host galaxy, and to establish whether there is a physical and/or evolutionary link between the CGM and the ISM. We have mapped the O/H and N/O gas abundances in two spatial dimensions across the giant nebula and within the galaxy by means of comparing emission line ratios with photoionization model predictions. We have also compared the kinematics of the giant nebula with that of the gas and the stars in the host galaxy. The widely studied AGN driven outflow responsible for the 10 kpc ionized bubble is enhancing the gas metal abundance up to 10 kpc from the AGN. O/H is solar or slightly higher in the bubble edges, in comparison with the subsolar abundances across the rest of the nebula median (O/H~0.63 (O/H)). The giant nebula shows complex kinematics. In addition to non circular motions, we propose that there is a rotational component that extends up to the nebular edge. It seems to be kinematically coupled at least partially with the stellar component and the ISM of the host galaxy. We conclude that AGN feedback can produce metal enrichment at large extranuclear distances in galaxies (~10 kpc). The dynamics of the giant nebula is consistent with CGM studies based on absorption lines that show evidence for a substantial rotation component in the CGM of numerous galaxies which, moreover, is often kinematically coupled with the ISM and stars of the galaxies.

  The long-standing question concerning Jetted Sub-Galactic Size (JSS) radio sources is whether they will evolve into large radio galaxies, die before escaping the host galaxy, or remain indefinitely confined to their compact size. Our main goal is to propose a scenario that explains the relative number of JSS radio sources and their general properties. We studied the parsec-scale radio morphology of a complete sample of 21 objects using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at various frequencies and analyzed the morphological characteristics of their optical hosts. Many of these radio sources exhibit radio morphologies consistent with transverse motions of their bright edges and are located in dynamically disturbed galaxies. VLBI images provide evidence for large-angle, short-period precessing jets, and the orbital motion of the radio-loud AGN in a dual or binary system. The majority of JSS radio sources are in systems in different stages of their merging evolution. We propose a scenario where the rapid jet redirection, through precession or orbital motion, prevents the jet from penetrating the interstellar medium (ISM) sufficiently to escape the host galaxy. Most JSS radio sources remain compact due to their occurrence in merging galaxies

  Strong soft X-ray emission called soft X-ray excess is often observed in luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). It has been suggested that the soft X-rays are emitted from a warm ($T=10^6\sim10^7\ \rm{K}$) region that is optically thick for the Thomson scattering (warm Comptonization region). Motivated by the recent observations that soft X-ray excess appears in changing look AGN (CLAGN) during the state transition from a dim state without broad emission lines to a bright state with broad emission lines, we performed global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations assuming that the mass accretion rate increases and becomes around $10$\% of the Eddington accretion rate. The simulation successfully reproduces a warm, Thomson-thick region outside the hot radiatively inefficient accretion flow near the black hole. The warm region is formed by efficient radiative cooling due to inverse Compton scattering. The calculated luminosity $0.01L_{{\rm Edd}}-0.08L_{{\rm Edd}}$ is consistent with the luminosity of CLAGN. We also found that the warm Comptonization region is well described by the steady model of magnetized disks supported by azimuthal magnetic fields. When the anti-parallel azimuthal magnetic fields supporting the radiatively cooled region reconnect around the equatorial plane of the disk, the temperature of the region becomes higher by releasing the magnetic energy transported to the region.

  Over three decades of reverberation mapping (RM) studies on local broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have measured reliable black-hole (BH) masses for $&gt; 100$ AGNs. These RM measurements reveal a significant correlation between the Balmer broad-line region size and the AGN optical luminosity (the $R-L$ relation). Recent RM studies for AGN samples with more diverse BH accretion parameters (e.g., mass and Eddington ratio) reveal a substantial intrinsic dispersion around the average $R-L$ relation, suggesting variations in the overall spectral energy distribution shape as functions of accretion parameters. Here we perform a detailed photoionization investigation of expected broad-line properties as functions of accretion parameters, using the latest models for the AGN continuum implemented in {\tt qsosed}. We compare theoretical predictions with observations of a sample of 67 $z\lesssim0.5$ reverberation-mapped AGNs with both rest-frame optical and UV spectra in the moderate-accretion regime (Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\equiv L/L_{\rm Edd}&lt;0.5$). The UV/optical line strengths and their dependences on accretion parameters can be reasonably well reproduced by the locally-optimally-emitting cloud (LOC) photoionization models. We provide quantitative recipes that use optical/UV line flux ratios to infer the ionizing continuum, which is not directly observable. In addition, photoionization models with universal values of ionization parameter ($\log U_{\rm H}=-2$) and hydrogen density ($\log n({\rm H})=12$) can qualitatively reproduce the observed global $R-L$ relation for the current AGN sample. However, such models fail to reproduce the observed trend of decreasing BLR size with $L/L_{\rm Edd}$ at fixed optical luminosity, which may imply that the gas density increases with the accretion rate.

  The cores of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are potential accelerators of 10-100 TeV cosmic rays, in turn producing high-energy neutrinos. This picture was confirmed by the compelling evidence of a TeV neutrino signal from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068, leaving open the question of which is the site and mechanism of cosmic ray acceleration. One candidate is the magnetized turbulence surrounding the central supermassive black hole. Recent particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence indicate that stochastic cosmic ray acceleration is non-resonant, in contrast to the assumptions of previous studies. We show that this has important consequences on a self-consistent theory of neutrino production in the corona, leading to a more rapid cosmic ray acceleration than previously considered. The turbulent magnetic field fluctuations needed to explain the neutrino signal are consistent with a magnetically powered corona. We find that strong turbulence, with turbulent magnetic energy density higher than $1\%$ of the rest mass energy density, naturally explains the normalization of the IceCube neutrino flux, in addition to the neutrino spectral shape. Only a fraction of the protons in the corona, which can be directly inferred from the neutrino signal, are accelerated to high energies. Thus, in this framework, the neutrino signal from NGC 1068 provides a testbed for particle acceleration in magnetized turbulence.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are prime candidate sources of the high-energy, astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. This is demonstrated by the real-time multi-messenger detection of the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the recent evidence of neutrino emission from NGC 1068 from a separate time-averaged study. However, the production mechanism of the astrophysical neutrinos in AGN is not well established which can be resolved via correlation studies with photon observations. For neutrinos produced due to photohadronic interactions in AGN, in addition to a correlation of neutrinos with high-energy photons, there would also be a correlation of neutrinos with photons emitted at radio wavelengths. In this work, we perform an in-depth stacking study of the correlation between 15 GHz radio observations of AGN reported in the MOJAVE XV catalog, and ten years of neutrino data from IceCube. We also use a time-dependent approach which improves the statistical power of the stacking analysis. No significant correlation was found for both analyses and upper limits are reported. When compared to the IceCube diffuse flux, at 100 TeV and for a spectral index of 2.5, the upper limits derived are $\sim3\%$ and $\sim9\%$ for the time-averaged and time-dependent case, respectively.

  Large-scale cosmic filaments connect galaxies, clusters and voids. They are permeated by magnetic fields with a variety of topologies. Cosmic rays with energies up to $10^{20}\;\!{\rm eV}$ can be produced in astrophysical environments associated with star-formation and AGN activities. The fate of these cosmic rays in filaments, which cannot be directly observed on Earth, are rarely studied. We investigate the high-energy processes associated with energetic particles (cosmic rays) in filaments, adopting an ecological approach that includes galaxies, clusters/superclusters and voids as key cosmological structures in the filament ecosystem. We derive the phenomenology for modelling interfaces between filaments and these structures, and investigate how the transfer and fate of energetic cosmic ray protons are affected by the magnetism of the interfaces. We consider different magnetic field configurations in filaments and assess the implications for cosmic ray confinement and survival against hadronic pion-producing and photo-pair interactions. Our analysis shows that the fate of the particles depends on the location of their origin within a filament ecosystem, and that filaments act as `highways', channelling cosmic rays between galaxies, galaxy clusters and superclusters. Filaments can also operate as cosmic `fly paper', capturing cosmic ray protons with energies up to $10^{18}\;\!{\rm eV}$ from cosmic voids. Our analysis predicts the presence of a population of $\sim 10^{12}-10^{16}\;\!{\rm eV}$ cosmic ray protons in filaments and voids accumulated continually over cosmic time. These protons do not suffer significant energy losses through photo-pair or pion-production, nor can they be cooled efficiently. Instead, they form a cosmic ray fossil record of the power generation history of the Universe.   

Ongoing and fossil large-scale outflows detected in a high-redshift

  We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the [C II] 158 $\mu$m line and the underlying continuum emission of TN J0924$-$2201, which is one of the most distant known radio galaxies at $z&gt;5$. The [C II] line and 1-mm continuum emission are detected at the host galaxy. The systemic redshift derived from the [C II] line is $z_{\rm [C II]}=5.1736\pm0.0002$, indicating that the Ly$\alpha$ line is redshifted by a velocity of $1035\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$, marking the largest velocity offset between the [C II] and Ly$\alpha$ lines recorded at $z&gt;5$ to date. In the central region of the host galaxy, we identified a redshifted substructure of [C II] with a velocity of $702\pm17$ km s$^{-1}$, which is close to the CIV line with a velocity of $500\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$. The position and the velocity offsets align with a model of an outflowing shell structure, consistent with the large velocity offset of Ly$\alpha$. The non-detection of [C II] and dust emission from the three CO(1--0)-detected companions indicates their different nature compared to dwarf galaxies based on the photodissociation region model. Given their large velocity of $\sim1500$ km s$^{-1}$, outflowing molecular clouds induced by the AGN is the most plausible interpretation, and they may exceed the escape velocity of a $10^{13}\,M_{\odot}$ halo. These results suggest that TN J0924$-$2201, with the ongoing and fossil large-scale outflows, is in a distinctive phase of removing molecular gas from a central massive galaxy in an overdense region in the early universe. A dusty HI absorber at the host galaxy is an alternative interpretation.

  We examine whether there are deviations of the local central oxygen abundances in spiral galaxies from the general metallicity gradients. We compare the values of the central intersect oxygen abundances estimated from the metallicity gradient based on the integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey and the local central oxygen abundances obtained from the single-fibre observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Special attention is placed on galaxies with recent and currently ongoing central starbursts (cSB galaxies). We selected a sample of 30 cSB galaxies from our total sample of 381 MaNGA galaxies, using the decrease in the Dn4000 index (a stellar age indicator) in the circumnuclear region as the selection criterion. We found that the local central oxygen abundances follow the general metallicity gradients in the galaxies well and agree with the central intersect abundances within uncertainties of the central abundances determinations. Starbursts in the centres of cSB galaxies do not produce noticeable oxygen enrichments. The central starbursts imply that an appreciable amount of gas is present at the centres of cSB galaxies. The gas at the centre of galaxy can serve not only as a raw material for the star formation, but also as a fuel for the activity of the galactic nucleus (AGN). We found that the AGN is the main source of the ionising radiation at the centres of six cSB galaxies in our sample.

  Powerful supermassive black hole (SMBH) winds in the form of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are detected in the X-ray spectra of several active galactic nuclei (AGN) seemingly independently of their radio classification between radio quiet (RQ) and radio loud (RL). In this work we explore the physical parameters of SMBH winds through a uniform analysis of a sample of X-ray bright RQ and RL AGN. We explored several correlations between different wind parameters and with respect to the AGN bolometric and Eddington luminosities. Our analysis shows that SMBH winds are not only a common trait of both AGN classes but also that they are most likely produced by the same physical mechanism. Consequently, we find that SMBH winds do not follow the radio-loudness dichotomy seen in jets. On average, a comparable amount of material accreted by the SMBH is ejected through such winds. The average wind power corresponds to about 3 per cent of the Eddington luminosity, confirming that they can drive AGN feedback. Moreover, the most energetic outflows are found in the most luminous sources. We find a possible positive correlation of the wind energetics, renormalized to the Eddington limit, with respect to $\lambda_{Edd}$, consistent with the correlation found with bolometric luminosity. We also observe a possible positive correlation between the energetics of the outflow and the X-ray radio-loudness parameter. In general, these results suggest an underlying relation between the acceleration mechanisms of accretion disc winds and jets.

  We report on the multi-year evolution of the population of X-ray sources in the nuclear region of NGC 3621 based on Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift observations. Among these, two sources, X1 and X5, after their first detection in 2008, seem to have faded below the detectability threshold, a most interesting fact as X1 is associated with the AGN of the galaxy. Two other sources, X3 and X6 are presented for the first time, the former showing a peculiar short-term variability in the latest available dataset, suggesting an egress from eclipse, hence belonging to the handful of known eclipsing ultra-luminous X-ray sources. One source, X4, previously known for its "heart-beat", i.e. a characteristic modulation in its signal with a period of $\approx1$ h, shows a steady behaviour in the latest observation. Finally, the brightest X-ray source in NGC 3621, here labelled X2, shows steady levels of flux across all the available datasets but a change in its spectral shape, reminiscent of the behaviours of Galactic disk-fed X-ray binaries.
