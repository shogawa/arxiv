  GHZ2/GLASS-z12 has been recently observed by JWST with both NIRSpec and MIRI spectrographs, making it the most distant galaxy ($z_{spec}=12.34$) with complete spectroscopic coverage from rest-frame UV to optical. It is identified as a strong CIV$_{1549}$ emitter with many other detected emission lines (NIV], HeII, OIII], NIII], CIII], [OII], [NeIII], [OIII], and H$\alpha$), including a remarkable OIII$_{1333}$ Bowen fluorescence line. We analyze in this paper the joint NIRSpec+MIRI spectral data set. Combining six optical diagnostics (namely R2, R3, R23, O32, Ne3O2, and Ne3O2Hd), we find extreme ionization conditions, with O32 $=1.39 \pm 0.19$ and Ne3O2 $=0.37 \pm 0.18$ in stark excess compared to typical values in the ISM at lower redshifts. These line properties are compatible either with an AGN or with a compact, very dense star-forming environment ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ $\sim 10^2$-$10^3$ Msun/yr/kpc$^2$), with a high ionization parameter ($\log_{10}$(U) $=-1.75 \pm 0.16$), a high ionizing photon production efficiency $\log(\xi_{\rm ion}) = 25.7_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$, and a low, although not pristine, metal content ranging between $5\%$ and $11\%$ Z$_\odot$, indicating a rapid enrichment of the ISM in the last few Myrs. These properties also suggest that a substantial amount of ionizing photons ($\sim 10\%$) are leaking outside. The general lessons learned from GHZ2 are the following: (i) the UV to optical combined nebular indicators are broadly in agreement with UV-only or optical-only indicators. (ii) UV+optical diagnostics fail to discriminate between an AGN and star-formation in a low metallicity, high density, and extreme ionization environment. (iii) comparing the nebular line ratios with local analogs may be approaching its limits at $z \gtrsim 10$, as this approach is potentially challenged by the unique conditions of star formation experienced by galaxies at these extreme redshifts.

  We present a sample of 305 QSO candidates having $|b| &lt; 30^{\circ}$, the majority with GALEX magnitudes NUV &lt; 18.75. To generate this sample, we apply UV-IR color selection criteria to photometric data from the Ultraviolet GAlactic Plane Survey (UVGAPS) as part of GALEX-CAUSE, the Million Quasars Catalog, Gaia DR2, and Pan-STARRS DR1. 165 of these 305 candidate UV-bright AGN (54%) have published spectroscopic redshifts from 45 different surveys, confirming them as AGN. We further obtained low-dispersion, optical, longslit spectra with the APO 3.5-m, MDM 2.4-m, and MDM 1.3-m telescopes for 84 of the candidates, and confirm 86% (N = 72) as AGN, generally with z &lt; 0.6. These sources fill a gap in the Galactic latitude coverage of the available samples of known UV-bright QSO background probes. Along with a description of the confirmed QSO properties, we provide the fully-reduced, flux and wavelength-calibrated spectra of 84 low-latitude QSOs through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes. Future HST/COS spectroscopy of these low-Galactic-latitude QSOs has the potential to transform our view of the Milky Way and Local Group circumgalactic medium.

  Recently, nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been subject to long X-rays/UV/optical monitoring campaigns. These campaigns reveal a strong correlation between the various UV and optical bands, with time lags increasing with wavelength. In a series of papers, we demonstrated that a scenario in which a central X-ray source illuminates the accretion disc explains the observed correlations. However, some of the monitored AGN show low/moderate X-rays-UV correlations, which could challenge this scenario. In this paper, we study the broadband X-ray/UV/optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of NGC 5548, one of the most intensively monitored AGN. We aim to test if the X-ray illumination model explains the broadband spectral behaviour of the source, despite the moderate X-ray-UV/optical correlation. We model the broadband time-averaged SED, from the STORM monitoring campaign of the source, using the KYNSED model which assumes an X-ray illuminated disc. We assume that the accretion process powers the X-ray corona. We also model 15 time-resolved SEDs from the same campaign to check whether this scenario can account for the observed spectral variability. The proposed model describes well the time-averaged and the time-resolved SEDs of NGC 5548. In this scenario, the corona height, the X-ray photon index, and the power transferred to the corona all vary. This explains the variability behaviour at different wavelengths. The best-fit model is obtained for a non-rotating black hole accreting at a constant rate of 5% its Eddington limit. Since each of the variable parameters affects the observed flux in a particular way, the combined variability of all parameters explains the moderate X-ray-UV/optical correlation. The X-ray illuminated disc model provides a complete description of the behaviour of NGC 5548, explaining its broadband SEDs, time-lag spectrum, and its power spectral distribution.   

The Impact of Feedback-driven Outflows on Bar Formation

  We investigate the coupling between the temporal variation from galaxy-formation feedback and the bar instability. We show that fluctuations from mass outflow on star-formation time scales affect the radial motion of disk orbits. The resulting incoherence in orbital phase leads to the disruption of the bar-forming dynamics. Bar formation is suppressed in starburst galaxies that have fluctuation time scales within the range 10 Myr to 200 Myr with repeated events with wind mass 15% of the disk within 0.5 scale lengths or 1.4% of the total disk mass. The work done by feedback is capable of reducing the amplitude or, with enough amplitude, destroying an existing bar. AGN feedback with similar amplitude and timescales would have similar behavior. To model the dynamics of the coupling and interpret the results of the full N-body simulations, we introduce a generalization of the Hamiltonian mean-field (HMF) model, drawing inspiration from the Lynden-Bell (1979) mechanism for bar growth. Our non-linear 'BarHMF' model is designed to reproduce linear perturbation theory in the low-amplitude limit. Notably, without star-formation feedback, this model exhibits exponential growth whose rate depends on disk mass and reproduces the expected saturation of bar growth observed in N-body simulations. We describe several promising applications of the BarHMF model beyond this study.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can power relativistic jets, which are called blazars when pointed close to our line of sight. Depending on the presence or absence of emission lines in their optical spectra, blazars are categorized into flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or BL Lacertae (BL Lacs) objects. According to the 'blazar sequence', as synchrotron peak frequency ($\nu^{sy}_{pk}$) shifts to higher energies, the synchrotron peak luminosity decreases. This means that BL Lacs as luminous as FSRQs, and with synchrotron peak frequencies $\nu^{sy}_{pk}&gt;10^{15}$ Hz, should not exist. Detected as a high-synchrotron peak (HSP; $\nu^{sy}_{pk}&gt;10^{15}$ Hz) BL Lac, 4FGL J1520.8-0348 shows high gamma-ray luminosity ($L_{\gamma}&gt;10^{46}\,\rm erg~s^{-1}$), being at a high redshift of $z=$1.46. Since it is an outlier in the 'blazar sequence', the process of its jet acceleration and power may be different from bona fide BL Lacs. In this work, we constrain its spectral energy distribution (SED) by modeling the multi-wavelength data from infrared to $\gamma$-ray regime. Simultaneous X-ray data was obtained from X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array to constrain the synchrotron emission and underlying electron distribution. On undertaking the SED modeling of the source, including the effect of extragalactic background light, we conclude that the source is more likely to be a 'blue FSRQ' or 'masquerading BL Lac' where the BL Lac is actually a FSRQ in disguise.

  We spectroscopically confirm the $M_{\rm UV} = -20.5$ mag galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 to be at redshift $z=12.34$. The source was selected via NIRCam photometry in GLASS-JWST Early Release Science data, providing the first evidence of a surprising abundance of bright galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$. The NIRSpec PRISM spectrum is remarkable and unlike any local analog. It shows significant detections of N IV, C IV, He II, O III, C III, O II, and Ne III lines, and the first detection in a high-redshift object of the O III Bowen fluorescence line at 3133 {\AA} rest-frame. The prominent C IV line with rest-frame equivalent width (EW) $\sim 46$ {\AA} puts GHZ2 in the category of extreme C IV emitters characterised by hard radiation fields. GHZ2 displays UV lines with EWs that are only found in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or composite objects at low/intermediate redshifts, and UV line-intensity ratios that are compatible both with AGNs and star formation in a low-metallicity environment. The nondetection of the very high-ionization lines [Ne IV] and [Ne V], and the remarkable similarity between GHZ2 and other known C IV emitters, favors a scenario in which the high ionizing output is due to very low metallicity, massive stars forming in a dense environment. We estimate a metallicity $\lesssim 0.1 Z/{\rm Z}_{\odot}$, a high ionization parameter logU $&gt;$ -2, a N/O abundance 4--5 times the solar value, and a subsolar C/O ratio similar to the recently discovered class of nitrogen-enhanced objects at high redshift. Considering its abundance patterns and the high stellar mass density ($10^4$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$), GHZ2 is an ideal formation site for the progenitors of today's globular clusters. The remarkable brightness of GHZ2 makes it a "Rosetta stone" for understanding the physics of galaxy formation within just 360 Myr after the Big Bang.

  We use the spectroscopic data collected by the Magellanic Quasars Survey (MQS) as well as the photometric V- and I-band data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to measure the physical parameters for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) located behind the Magellanic Clouds. The flux-uncalibrated MQS spectra were obtained with the 4-m Anglo-Australian Telescope and the AAOmega spectroscope (R=1300) in a typical ~1.5-hour visit. They span a spectral range of 3700-8500 Angstroms and have S/N ratios in a range of 3-300. We report the discovery and observational properties of 161 AGNs in this footprint, which expands the total number of spectroscopically confirmed AGNs by MQS to 919. After converting the OGLE mean magnitudes to the monochromatic luminosities at 5100 Angstroms, 3000 Angstroms, and 1350 Angstroms, we reliably measured the black hole masses for 165 out of 919 AGNs. The remaining physical parameters we provide are the bolometric luminosities and the Eddington ratios. A fraction of these AGNs have been observed by the OGLE survey since 1997 (all of them since 2001), enabling studies of correlations between their variability and physical parameters.

  In our previous work on broadband photometric reverberation mapping (PRM), we proposed the ICCF-Cut process to obtain the time lags of H$\alpha$ emission line from two broadband lightcurves via subtracting the continuum emission from the line band. Extending the work, we enlarge our sample to the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) database. We adopt two criteria to select 123 type 1 AGNs with sufficient variability and smooth lightcurves from 3537 AGNs at $z&lt;0.09$ with more than 100 epoch observations in the $g$ and $r$ bands from the ZTF database. We calculate the H$\alpha$ time lags for 23 of them which have previous spectroscopic reverberation mapping (SRM) results using ICCF-Cut, JAVELIN and $\chi ^2$ methods. Our obtained H$\alpha$ time lags are slightly larger than the H$\beta$ time lags, which is consistent with the previous SRM results and the theoretical model of the AGN broad line region. The comparisons between SRM and PRM lag distributions and between the subtracted emission line lightcurves indicate that after selecting AGNs with the two criteria, combining the ICCF-Cut, JAVELIN and $\chi^2$ methods provides an efficient way to get the reliable H$\alpha$ lags from the broadband PRM. Such techniques can be used to estimate the black hole masses of a large sample of AGNs in the large multi-epoch photometric sky surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the survey from the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) in the near future.
