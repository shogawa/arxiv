  In the X-ray spectra of AGNs, a noticeable excess of soft X-rays is typically detected beyond the extrapolation of the power-law trend observed between 2-10 keV. In the scenario of warm Comptonization, observations propose a warm corona temperature ranging from 0.1-1 keV and an optical depth of approximately 10-20. Furthermore, according to radiative constraints derived from spectral analyses employing Comptonization models, it is suggested that the majority of the accretion power is released within the warm corona, while the disk beneath it is largely non-dissipative, emitting mainly the reprocessed radiation from the corona. We test the dissipative warm corona model using the radiative transfer code-TITAN/NOAR on a sample of 82 XMM-Newton observations of AGNs. Through spectral modeling of the X-ray data, we aim to estimate the total amount of internal heating inside the warm corona situated on top of the accretion disk. By modeling the 0.3-10 keV EPIC-pn spectra, we estimate the internal heating and optical depth of the warm corona and check their correlations with global parameters blackhole parameters. From model normalization, we compute the radial extent of warm corona on top of cold accretion disk. Our model infers the presence of dissipative warm corona, with optical depths distributed in the range 6-30 and total internal heating in the range 1-29 x 1e-23 erg/s-cm3. The extent of warm corona is spread across a large range from 7-408 gravitational radii, and we find that warm corona is more extended for larger accretion rates. Soft excess emission is ubiquitous in AGNs across wide mass range and accretion rate. We confirm that warm corona responsible for producing the soft-excess is highly dissipative in nature with larger optical depths being associated with lower internal heating and vice versa. The presence of cold standard accretion disk regulates the extent of warm corona.

  We report our identification of three gigaelectronvolt $\gamma$-ray sources, 4FGL J0502.6+0036, 4FGL J1055.9+6507, and 4FGL J1708.2+5519, as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). They are listed in the latest Fermi-LAT source catalog as unidentified ones. We find that the sources all showed $\gamma$-ray flux variations in recent years. Using different survey catalogs, we are able to find a radio source within the error circle of each source's position. Further analysis of optical sources in the fields allows us to determine the optical counterparts, which showed similar variation patterns to those seen in $\gamma$-rays. The optical counterparts have reported redshifts of 0.6, 1.5, and 2.3, respectively, estimated from photometric measurements. In addition, we also obtain an X-ray spectrum of 4FGL J0502.6+0036 and a flux upper limit on the X-ray emission of 4FGL J1055.9+6507 by analyzing the archival data. The broadband spectral energy distributions of the three sources from radio to $\gamma$-rays are constructed. Comparing mainly the $\gamma$-ray properties of the three sources with those of different sub-classes of AGNs, we tentatively identify them as blazars. Followup optical spectroscopy is highly warranted for obtaining their spectral features and thus verifying the identification.

  As the hottest high-energy neutrino spot, NGC 1068 has received much attention in recent years. Here we focus on the central region of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and propose an outflow-cloud interaction model that could probably explain the observed neutrino data. Considering the accretion process adjacent to the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of NGC 1068, strong outflows will be generated, which will likely interact with surrounding clouds floating in the corona region. Particles carried by the outflow will be accelerated to very high energy by the shocks forming during the outflow-cloud interactions. For the accelerated high-energy protons, $p\gamma$ interactions with the background photon field of the corona and disk and $pp$ interaction with the surrounding gas will produce considerable high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrino. However, because of the extremely dense photon fields in the corona and disk, the newly generated $\gamma$-rays will be significantly attenuated through the $\gamma\gamma$ absorptions. In our scenario, the expected GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray emission will be suppressed to a much lower level than the neutrino emission, consistent with the observational characteristics of NGC 1068, while the generated 1-30\,TeV neutrino flux can fit the IceCube data very well.

  [Abridged] ESO 141-G55 is a nearby X-ray bright BLS1, which has been classified as a bare AGN due to the lack of warm absorption along its line-of-sight, providing an unhampered view into its disc-corona system. We aim to probe its disc-corona system thanks to the first simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation obtained on October 1-2, 2022. We carry out the X-ray broadband spectral analysis to determine the dominant process(es) at work, as well as the SED analysis to determine the disc-corona properties. The simultaneous broadband X-ray spectrum of ESO 141-G55 is characterised by the presence of a prominent smooth soft X-ray excess, a broad Fe K emission line and a significant Compton hump. The RGS spectra confirmed the lack of intrinsic warm-absorbing gas along our line of sight in the AGN rest frame, confirming that it is still in a bare state. However, soft X-ray emission lines are observed indicating substantial warm gas out of our line of sight. The intermediate inclination of the disc-corona system, ~43{\deg}, may offer us a favourable configuration to observe UFOs from the disc, but none is found in this 2022 observation, contrary to a previous 2007 XMM-Newton one. Relativistic reflection alone on a standard disc is ruled out from the X-ray broadband analysis, while a combination of soft and hard Comptonisation by a warm and hot corona (relagn), plus relativistic reflection (reflkerrd) reproduces its SED quite well. The hot corona temperature is very hot, ~140 keV, much higher than about 80% of the AGNs, whereas the warm corona temperature, ~0.3 keV, is similar to the values found in other sub-Eddington AGNs. ESO 141-G55 is accreting at a moderate Eddington accretion rate (~10--20%). Our analysis points to a significant contribution of an optically-thick warm corona to both the soft X-ray and UV emission in ESO 141-G55.   

Comparing extragalactic megahertz-peaked spectrum and gigahertz-peaked

  Recent sensitive wide-field radio surveys, such as the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS), and the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS), enable the selection of statistically large samples of peaked-spectrum (PS) sources. PS sources are radio sources that have a peak in their radio continuum spectrum and are observed to be compact. They are often considered to be the precursors to large radio galaxies. We present a sample of 8,032 gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) sources with spectral turnovers near 1400 MHz, and a sample of 506 megahertz-peaked spectrum (MPS) sources with turnovers near 144 MHz. Our GPS sample is over five times larger than any previously known sample of PS sources. These large sample sizes allow us to make a robust comparison between GPS sources and MPS sources, such that we can investigate the differences between these types of sources, and study their lifetimes. The shape of the source counts of both samples match that of the general radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) samples, scaled down by a factor 44 $\pm$ 2 for the MPS sample, and a factor 28 $\pm$ 1 for the GPS sample. Assuming no cosmological evolution, these offsets imply that both MPS and GPS sources have shorter duration than general radio-loud AGN, with MPS sources having an $\approx$1.6 times shorter lifespan than GPS sources. The shorter duration of MPS sources relative to GPS sources can be explained by the transition between GPS and MPS sources coinciding with the jet breakout phase of PS sources, such that GPS sources traverse through the surrounding medium at a lower speed than MPS sources. Such evolution has been observed in simulations of PS source evolution.   

Forgotten treasures in the HST/FOC UV imaging polarimetric archives of

  The Mrk 463 system is known to host two powerful sources separated by about 4 kpc, both identified as active galactic nuclei (AGN). This makes the Mrk 463 system a unique laboratory to study the geometry and dynamics of galaxy merging and its relation to AGN duty cycles. The eastern nuclei, Mrk 463E, is the brightest of the two and thus a prime target for a polarimetric study. It is classified as a Seyfert 2 galaxy, meaning that one could expect large polarization degrees from scattering off electrons and dust in the polar winds. In the continuity of our series of papers, we reduced archived and previously unpublished polarization observations obtained with the Faint Object Camera (FOC) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), to obtain a high resolution near ultraviolet (near-UV) polarization map of the Mrk 463E nuclei. We coupled this map to near infrared (NIR) and X-ray observations to get a clear picture of the geometric arrangement of matter around the core of Mrk 463E. We found that the nucleus location is further South from the optical peak flux than previously estimated. The strongly polarized conical wind has a half-opening angle of ~15{\deg} and display three main periods of mass ejection. Its polarization allowed us to estimate the AGN inclination towards the observer (~55{\deg}) Finally, our maps revealed a gas streamer connecting Mrk 463E and Mrk 463W, with a tentative detection of a large kpc-scale ordered magnetic field connecting both galaxies. This unpublished observation turned out to offer more than the original proposal asked for and allowed to derive tight geometric and dynamical constraints for Mrk 463E. High resolution radio maps and IR polarimetry are now necessary to further study the jet and the newly discovered gas streamer.

  Protoclusters at $z&gt;2$ are gas-rich regions characterized by high star-formation activity. The same physical properties that enhance star formation in protoclusters are also thought to boost the growth of SMBHs. We aim to test this scenario by probing the AGN content of SPT2349-56, a massive, gas-rich, and highly star-forming protocluster core at $z=4.3$ discovered as an overdensity of DSFGs, via Chandra (200 ks) observations, and comparing the results with the field environment. We detected two protocluster members, corresponding to an AGN fraction among DSFGs of $\approx10\%$. This value is consistent with other protoclusters at $z=2-4$, but higher than the AGN incidence among DSFGs in the field environment. Both AGN are heavily obscured sources and hosted in star-forming galaxies with $\approx3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar masses. We estimate that the ISM in the host galaxies can contribute significantly to the nuclear obscuration. One of the two AGN is highly luminous ($L_X=2\times10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) and Compton-thick ($N_H=2\times10^{24}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$), and likely powered by a $M_{BH}&gt;6\times10^8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ SMBH. Its high accretion rate suggests that it is in the phase of efficient growth required to explain the presence of extremely massive SMBHs in the centers of local galaxy clusters. Considering SPT2349-56 and DRC, a similar protocuster at $z=4$, we find that gas-rich protocluster cores at $z\approx4$ enhance the triggering of luminous (log$\frac{L_X}{\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}}=45-46$) AGN by 3-5 orders of magnitude with respect to the field environment. Our results indicate that gas-rich protoclusters at high redshift boost the growth of SMBHs, which will likely impact the subsequent evolution of the structures, and thus represent key science targets to obtain a complete understanding of the relation between environment and galaxy evolution.
