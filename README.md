  We analyze the X-ray properties for a sample of 23 high probability AGN candidates with ultraviolet variability identified in Wasleske et al. (2022). Using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton Observatory, we find 11/23 nuclei are X-ray detected. We use SED modeling to compute star formation rates and show that the X-ray luminosities are typically in excess of the X-ray emission expected from star formation by at least an order of magnitude. Interestingly, this sample shows a diversity of optical spectroscopic properties. We explore possible reasons for why some objects lack optical spectroscopic signatures of black hole activity while still being UV variable and X-ray bright. We find that host galaxy stellar emission and obscuration from gas and dust are all potential factors. We study where this sample falls on relationships such as $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{2500}$ and $L_{X}-L_{IR}$ and find that some of the sample falls outside the typical scatter for these relations, indicating they differ from the standard quasar population. With the diversity of optical spectroscopic signatures and varying impacts of dust and stellar emissions on our sample, these results emphasizes the strength of variability in selecting the most complete set of AGN, regardless of other host galaxy properties.

  Binary and dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) are an important observational tool for studying the formation and dynamical evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). An entirely new method for identifying possible AGN pairs makes use of the exquisite positional accuracy of Gaia to detect astrometrically-variable quasars, in tandem with the high spatial resolution of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We present a new pilot study of radio observations of 18 quasars (0.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.9), selected from the SDSS DR16Q and matched with the Gaia DR3. All 18 targets are identified by their excess astrometric noise in Gaia. We targeted these 18 quasars with the VLA at 2-4 GHz (S-band) and 8-12 GHz (X-band), providing resolutions of 0.65" and 0.2", respectively, in order to constrain the origin of this variability. We combine these data with ancillary radio survey data and perform radio spectral modeling. The new observations are used to constrain the driver of the excess astrometric noise. We find that ~39% of the target sample is likely to be either candidate dual AGN or gravitationally lensed quasars. Ultimately, we use this new strategy to help identify and understand this sample of astrometrically-variable quasars, demonstrate the potential of this method for systematically identifying kpc-scale dual quasars.
