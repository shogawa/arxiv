  The chemical enrichment of X-ray-emitting hot atmospheres has hitherto been primarily studied in galaxy clusters. These studies revealed relative abundances of heavy elements that are remarkably similar to Solar. Here, we present measurements of the metal content of M89 (NGC 4552), an elliptical galaxy infalling into the Virgo cluster with a $\sim$10 kpc ram-pressure stripped X-ray tail. We take advantage of deep Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, and with particular attention to carefully modelling the spectra, we measure the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Si/Fe and S/Fe ratios. Contrary to previous measurements in galaxy clusters, our results for the hot atmosphere of M89 suggest super-Solar abundance ratios with respect to iron (i.e. $\alpha$/Fe &gt; 1), similar to its stellar components. Our analysis of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in this system indicates that the AGN-induced outflow could have facilitated the stripping of the original galactic atmosphere, which has been replaced with fresh stellar mass loss material with super-Solar $\alpha$/Fe abundance ratios. Additionally, we report a new fitting bias in the RGS data of low-temperature plasma. The measured O/Fe ratios are &gt;1$\sigma$ lower in multi-temperature models than a single temperature fit, leading to discrepancies in the calculations of supernova fractions derived from the metal abundances.

  We present observations using the NOrthern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA) of CO and $\rm H_{2}O$ emission lines, and the underlying dust continuum in two quasars at $z \sim 6$, i.e., P215-16 at $z$ = 5.78 and J1429+5447 at $z$ = 6.18. Notably, among all published CO SLEDs of quasars at $z \sim 6$, the two systems reveal the highest and the lowest CO level of excitation, respectively. Our radiative transfer modeling of the CO SLED of P215-16 suggests that the molecular gas heated by AGN could be a plausible origin for the high CO excitation. For J1429+5447, we obtain the first well-sampled CO SLED (from transitions from 2-1 to 10-9) of a radio-loud quasar at $z\gtrsim 6$. Analysis of the CO SLED suggests that a single photo-dissociation region (PDR) component could explain the CO excitation in the radio-loud quasar J1429+5447. This work highlights the utility of the CO SLED in uncovering the ISM properties in these young quasar-starburst systems at the highest redshift. The diversity of the CO SLEDs reveals the complexities in gas conditions and excitation mechanisms at their early evolutionary stage.

  GN-z11 is the highest redshift galaxy spectroscopically confirmed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Previous measurements of the effective radius of GN-z11 utilized galfit, which is not optimized to measure structural parameters for such a faint, distant object. Using a new software program called forcepho on HST data for the first time, we derive a size from images in the F160W band obtained both from the complete CANDELS survey and additional midcycle observations in order to contribute to the knowledge base on the size evolution, size-luminosity, and size-mass relation of early galaxies. We find a half-light radius mean of 0''.036 \(\pm\) 0''.006 corresponding to a physical size of 0.15 \(\pm\) 0.025 kpc. This size, smaller than the point spread function, is dramatically smaller than previous estimates with shallower HST data using galfit but consistent with recent measurements using forcepho on new JWST data arXiv:2302.07234. Such a small size, combined with the JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopic observations arXiv:2305.12492, suggests that GN-z11's high luminosity is dominated by an AGN.

  We use the recent statistics of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope$ (JWST) data at $z \sim 3.4$ to address two aspects of the feedback and evolution scenarios of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB). We find that the JWST data provide evidence for the members of a binary black hole being 'lit' at the same time, rather than independently -- a scenario which is consistent with gas-rich mergers being responsible for concurrent AGN activity. This conclusion is supported by the recent NANOGrav Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements, whose upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave strain amplitude lie below those expected from extrapolating the dual AGN fraction. The results indicate either a 'stalling' of the binaries at the separations probed by NANOGrav, or rapid gas-driven inspirals.

  Blazars are radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) whose jets have a very small angle to our line of sight. Observationally, the radio emission are mostly compact or a compact-core with a 1-sided jet. With 2.5$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution at 3 GHz, the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) enables us to resolve the structure of some blazar candidates in the sky north of Decl. $-40$ deg. We introduce an algorithm to classify radio sources as either blazar-like or non-blazar-like based on their morphology in the VLASS images. We apply our algorithm to three existing catalogs, including one of known blazars (Roma-BzCAT) and two of blazar candidates identified by WISE colors and radio emission (WIBRaLS, KDEBLLACS). We show that in all three catalogs, there are objects with morphology inconsistent with being blazars. Considering all the catalogs, more than 12% of the candidates are unlikely to be blazars, based on this analysis. Notably, we show that 3% of the Roma-BzCAT "confirmed" blazars could be a misclassification based on their VLASS morphology. The resulting table with all sources and their radio morphological classification is available online.

  We present an optical-to-radio study of the BL Lac object S4 0954+658 observations during 1998-2023. The measurements were obtained with the SAO RAS Zeiss-1000 1-m and AS-500/2 0.5-m telescopes in 2003-2023, with the RATAN-600 radio telescope at 1.25 (0.96, 1.1), 2.3, 4.7 (3.7, 3.9), 8.2 (7.7), 11.2, 22.3 (21.7) GHz in 1998-2023, with the IAA RAS RT-32 Zelenchukskaya and Badary telescopes at 5.05 and 8.63 GHz in 2020--2023, and with the RT-22 single-dish telescope of CrAO RAS at 36.8 GHz in 2009-2023. In this period the blazar had been showing extremely high broadband activity with the variability amplitude of flux densities up to 70-100% both in the optical and radio domains. In the period of 2014-2023 the blazar had been showing the historically highest activity in the radio wavelengths, and we detected multiple radio flares of varying amplitude and duration. The large flares last on average from 0.3 to 1 year at 22-36.8 GHz and slightly longer at 5-11.2 GHz. The optical flares are shorter and last 7-50 days. In the most active epoch of 2018-2023 the characteristic time scale $\tau$ of variation at 5-22 GHz is about 100 days and about 1000 days for the state with lower activity in 2009-2014. We found a general correlation between the optical, radio, and $\gamma$-ray flux variations, which suggests that we observe the same photon population from different emission regions. We estimated linear size of this region as 0.5-2 pc for different epochs. A broadband two components radio spectrum of S4 0954+658 jet was modelled by using both electrons and protons as emitting particles. It is shown that the synchrotron radio waves in this AGN may be generated by relativistic protons.

  Mixtures of gas and dust are pervasive in the universe, from AGN and molecular clouds to proto-planetary discs. When the two species drift relative to each other, a large class of instabilities can arise, called resonant drag instabilities (RDIs). The most famous RDI is the streaming instability, which plays an important role in planet formation. On the other hand, acoustic RDIs, the simplest kind, feature in the winds of cool stars, AGN, or starburst regions. Unfortunately, owing to the complicated dynamics of two coupled fluids (gas and dust), the underlying physics of most RDIs is mysterious. In this paper, we develop a clear physical picture of how the acoustic RDI arises and support this explanation with transparent mathematics. We find that the acoustic RDI is built on two coupled mechanisms. In the first, the converging flows of a sound wave concentrate dust. In the second, a drifting dust clump excites sound waves. These processes feed into each other at resonance, thereby closing an unstable feedback loop. This physical picture helps decide where and when RDIs are most likely to happen, and what can suppress them. Additionally, we find that the acoustic RDI remains strong far from resonance. This second result suggests that one can simulate RDIs without having to fine-tune the dimensions of the numerical domain.   

What Drives the Variability in AGN: Explaining the UV-Xray Disconnect
  Through Propagating Fluctuations

  Intensive broadband reverberation mapping (IBRM) campaigns have shown that AGN variability is significantly more complex than expected from disc reverberation of the variable X-ray illumination. The UV/optical variability is highly correlated and lagged, with longer lag at longer wavelength, but the timescale is longer than expected. More challenging though is that the UV/optical lightcurves are not well correlated with the X-rays which were meant to be driving them. Instead, we consider an intrinsically variable accretion disc, where mass accretion rate fluctuations propagate in through the flow, modulating the intrinsically faster X-ray variability from the central regions. We match our model to the parameters of Fairall 9, a well studied AGN with $L\sim 0.1L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$, where the spectrum is dominated by the UV/EUV rather than the X-rays. We show that intrinsic variability and propagation gives X-ray and UV/optical light-curves that are dominated by variability on two different time-scales, yet are correlated on long time-scales. We include reprocessing of the X-rays from the disc but this has negligible impact on the lightcurves for spectra where the EUV dominates the bolometric power. We also include reverberation of the total (EUV plux X-ray) variable spectrum off a wind. This results in a bound-free component which predominantly follows the slow variable EUV, but lagged and smoothed on the light-travel time. This spectrum is redder than the EUV disc emission, so it contributes more at longer wavelengths giving the apparent rise in lag time with wavelength from a constant lag component. We conclude that contrary to the original motivation for IBRM campaigns, AGN variability is likely driven by intrinsic fluctuations within the disc, not X-ray reprocessing, and that the observed lags are produced by the EUV illumination of the wind not the X-ray illumination of the disc.

  We present a 24 um-selected spectroscopic sample z &gt; 0.13 (median z = 0.41) in the Lockman Hole field, consisting of 4035 spectra. Our aim is to identify AGNs and determine their fraction in this mid-infrared selected sample. In this work, we use the [Ne V]3426 emission line to spectroscopically identify AGNs. Combined with broad-line Type I AGNs selected in our previous study, our sample consists of 887 (22%) spectroscopically confirmed AGNs. We perform a stacking analysis on the remaining spectra, and find that in various MIR-wedge-selected AGN candidates, the stacked spectra still show significant [Ne V]3426 emission, In contrast, no clear [Ne V]3426 signal is detected in non-AGN candidates falling outside the wedges. Assuming a range of AGN mid-IR SED slope of 0.3&lt; alpha &lt;0.7, and an average star-forming relation derived from 65 star-forming templates, we develop a robust method to separate the AGN and star-forming contributions to the mid-IR SEDs using the rest-frame L12 /L1.6 vs L4.5 /L1.6 diagram. We separate the objects into bins of L12 , and find that AGN fraction increases with increasing L12. We also find that the stacked [Ne V]3426 strength scales with L12 . The pure AGN luminosity at 12 um exhibits a positive correlation with the star formation rates, indicating possible co-evolution and common gas supply between the AGN and their host galaxies. Varying population properties across the redshift range explored contribute to the observed correlation.

  Compact radio AGN are thought to be young radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the early stage of AGN evolution, thus are ideal laboratory to study the high-energy emission throughout the evolution of radio AGN. In this work, we report for the first time the detection of the high-energy cutoff ($E_{\rm cut}$), a direct indicator of thermal coronal radiation, of X-ray emission in Mrk 348 ($z$ = 0.015), a young radio galaxy classified as compact symmetric object. With a 100 ks NuSTAR exposure, we find that the high-energy cutoff ($E_{\rm cut}$ ) is firmly detected ($218^{+124}_{-62}$ keV). Fitting with various Comptonization models indicates the presence of a hot corona with temperature $kT_{\rm e}$ = 35 -- 40 keV. These strongly support the corona origin for its hard X-ray emission. The comparison in the $E_{\rm cut}$ -- spectra index $\Gamma$ plot of Mrk 348 with normal large-scale radio galaxies (mostly FR II) yields no difference between them. This suggests the corona properties in radio sources may not evolve over time (i.e., from the infant stage to mature stage), which is to-be-confirmed with future sample studies of young radio AGN.   

The Origin of the X-ray Emission from the Non-Starburst Gas-Rich

  We present an analysis of the XMM-Newton observation of luminous infrared merging galaxies Arp 302 and a joint re-analysis of its Chandra observation. In particular, we focus on the more significant X-ray emitter of the pair, Arp 302N. Chandra detects significant soft X-ray emission from the hot gas in the star-forming region of Arp 302N spreading up to 12 kpc. We estimate the star-formation rate of Arp 302N to be around 1-2 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ based on the X-ray luminosity of the star-forming region, similar to previous measurements at longer wavelengths. Chandra and XMM-Newton observations show evidence of a Si XIII emission line with 86% confidence. Our best-fit model infers a super-solar silicon abundance in the star-forming region, likely related to the past core-collapse supernovae in this galaxy. Similar silicon overabundance was reported in the circumstellar medium of core-collapse supernova remnants in our Galaxy.   We also detect narrow Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ (98.6% confidence) emission lines as part of the AGN emission. Our best-fit spectral model using Mytorus indicates the evidence of a heavily obscured power-law emission with $N_{\rm H}&gt;3\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ in addition to a weak, unobscured power-law emission. The scattering fraction of the unobscured power-law emission from Compton-thin materials is 0.7%. All these spectral features suggest evidence of a Seyfert 2-like AGN in Arp 302N. The X-ray measurement of its AGN activity is consistent with the previous Spitzer measurement of the same object.

  We present the results of our search for Lyman continuum (LyC) emitting AGN at redshifts 2.3$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$4.9 from HST WFC3 F275W observations in the UVCANDELS fields. We also include LyC emission from AGN using HST WFC3 F225W, F275W, and F336W found in the ERS and HDUV data. We performed exhaustive queries of the Vizier database to locate AGN with high quality spectroscopic redshifts. In total, we found 51 AGN that met our criteria within the UVCANDELS and ERS footprints. Of these 51, we find 12 AGN had $\geq$4$\sigma$ detected LyC flux in the WFC3/UVIS images. Using space- and ground-based data from X-ray to radio, we fit the multi-wavelength photometric data of each AGN to a CIGALE SED and correlate various SED parameters to the LyC flux. KS-tests of the SED parameter distributions for the LyC-detected and non-detected AGN showed they are likely not distinct samples. However, we find that X-ray luminosity, star-formation onset age, and disk luminosity show strong correlations relative to their emitted LyC flux. We also find strong correlation of the LyC flux to several dust parameters, i.e., polar and toroidal dust emission, 6 $\mu m$ luminosity, and anti-correlation with metallicity and $A_{FUV}$. We simulate the LyC escape fraction ($f_{esc}$) using the CIGALE and IGM transmission models for the LyC-detected AGN and find an average $f_{esc}$$\simeq$18%, weighted by uncertainties. We stack the LyC flux of subsamples of AGN according to the wavelength continuum region in which they are detected and find no significant distinctions in their LyC emission, although our $sub-mm\ detected$ F336W sample shows the brightest stacked LyC flux. These findings indicate that LyC-production and -escape in AGN is more complicated than the simple assumption of thermal emission and a 100% escape fraction. Further testing of AGN models with larger samples than presented here is needed.

  H1821+643 is the nearest quasar hosted by a galaxy cluster. The energy output by the quasar, in the form of intense radiation and radio jets, is captured by the surrounding hot atmosphere. Here we present a new deep Chandra observation of H1821+643 and extract the hot gas properties into the region where Compton cooling by the quasar radiation is expected to dominate. Using detailed simulations to subtract the quasar light, we show that the soft-band surface brightness of the hot atmosphere increases rapidly by a factor of ~ 30 within the central ~ 10 kpc. The gas temperature drops precipitously to &lt; 0.4 keV and the density increases by over an order of magnitude. The remarkably low metallicity here is likely due to photo-ionization by the quasar emission. The variations in temperature and density are consistent with hydrostatic compression of the hot atmosphere. The extended soft-band peak cannot be explained by an undersubtraction of the quasar or scattered quasar light and is instead due to thermal ISM. The radiative cooling time of the gas falls to only 12 +/- 1 Myr, below the free fall time, and we resolve the sonic radius. H1821+643 is therefore embedded in a cooling flow with a mass deposition rate of up to 3000 Msolar/yr. Multi-wavelength observations probing the star formation rate and cold gas mass are consistent with a cooling flow. We show that the cooling flow extends to much larger radii than can be explained by Compton cooling. Instead, the AGN appears to be underheating the core of this cluster.

  Multi-wavelength spectroscopy of NGC 5548 revealed remarkable changes due to presence of an obscuring wind from the accretion disk. This broadened our understanding of obscuration and outflows in AGN. Swift monitoring of NGC 5548 shows that over the last 10 years the obscuration has gradually declined. This provides a valuable opportunity for analyses that have not been feasible before because of too much obscuration. The lowered obscuration, together with the high energy spectral coverage of Chandra HETG, facilitate the first study of X-ray absorption lines in the obscured state. The comparison of the lines (Mg XI, Mg XII, Si XIII, and Si XIV) between the new and historical spectra reveals interesting changes, most notably the He-like absorption being significantly diminished in 2022. Our study finds that the changes are caused by an increase in both the ionization parameter and the column density of the warm-absorber outflow in the obscured state. This is contrary to the shielding scenario that is evident in the appearance of the UV lines, where the inner obscuring wind shields outflows that are located further out, thus lowering their ionization. The X-ray absorption lines in the HETG spectra appear to be unaffected by the obscuration. The results suggest that the shielding is complex since various components of the ionized outflow are impacted differently. We explore various possibilities for the variability behavior of the X-ray absorption lines and find that the orbital motion of a clumpy ionized outflow traversing our line of sight is the most likely explanation.

  Constraining the physical conditions of the ionized media in the vicinity of an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) is crucial to understanding how these complex systems operate. Metal emission lines such as iron (Fe) are useful probes to trace the gaseous media's abundance, activity, and evolution in these accreting systems. Among these, the FeII emission has been the focus of many prior studies to investigate the energetics, kinematics, and composition of the broad-emission line region (BELR) from where these emission lines are produced. In this work, we present the first simultaneous FeII modeling in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) regions. We use CLOUDY photoionization code to simulate both spectral regions in the wavelength interval 4000-12000 Angstroms. We compare our model predictions with the observed line flux ratios for IZw1 - a prototypical strong FeII-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN). This allows putting constraints on the BLR cloud density and metal content that is optimal for the production of the FeII emission, which can be extended to IZw1-like sources, by examining a broad parameter space. We demonstrate the salient and distinct features of the FeII pseudo-continuum in the optical and NIR, giving special attention to the effect of micro-turbulence on the intensity of the FeII emission.

  We report on a detailed spatial and spectral analysis of the large-scale X-ray emission from the merging cluster Cygnus A. We use 2.2 Ms Chandra and 40 ks XMM-Newton archival datasets to determine the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster gas in the merger region between the two sub-clusters in the system. These profiles exhibit temperature enhancements that imply significant heating along the merger axis. Possible sources for this heating include the shock from the ongoing merger, past activity of the powerful AGN in the core, or a combination of both. To distinguish between these scenarios, we compare the observed X-ray properties of Cygnus A with simple, spherical cluster models. These models are constructed using azimuthally averaged density and temperature profiles determined from the undisturbed regions of the cluster and folded through MARX to produce simulated Chandra observations. The thermodynamic properties in the merger region from these simulated X-ray observations were used as a baseline for comparison with the actual observations. We identify two distinct components in the temperature structure along the merger axis, a smooth, large-scale temperature excess we attribute to the ongoing merger, and a series of peaks where the temperatures are enhanced by 0.5-2.5 keV. If these peaks are attributable to the central AGN, the location and strength of these features imply that Cygnus A has been active for the past 300 Myr injecting a total of $\sim$10$^{62}$ erg into the merger region. This corresponds to $\sim$10% of the energy deposited by the merger shock.

  We present an analysis of the X-ray properties 10 luminous, dust-reddened quasars from the FIRST-2MASS (F2M) survey based on new and archival Chandra observations. These systems are interpreted to be young, transitional objects predicted by merger-driven models of quasar/galaxy co-evolution. The sources have been well-studied from the optical through mid-infrared, have Eddington ratios above 0.1, and possess high-resolution imaging, most of which shows disturbed morphologies indicative of a recent or ongoing merger. When combined with previous X-ray studies of five other F2M red quasars, we find that the sources, especially those hosted by mergers, have moderate to high column densities ($N_H \simeq 10^{22.5-23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$) and Eddington ratios high enough to enable radiation pressure to blow out the obscuring material. We confirm previous findings that red quasars have dust-to-gas ratios that are significantly lower than the value for the Milky Way's interstellar medium, especially when hosted by a merger. The dust-to-gas ratio for two red quasars that lack evidence for merging morphology is consistent with the Milky Way and they do not meet the radiative feedback conditions for blowout. These findings support the picture of quasar/galaxy co-evolution in which a merger results in feeding of and feedback from an AGN. We compare the F2M red quasars to other obscured and reddened quasar populations in the literature, finding that, although morphological information is lacking, nearly all such samples meet blowout conditions and exhibit outflow signatures suggestive of winds and feedback.

  Using a 12 ks archival Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-S observation on the massive globular cluster (GC) M14, we detect a total of 7 faint X-ray sources within its half-light radius at a 0.5-7 keV depth of $2.5\times 10^{31}\,\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. We cross-match the X-ray source positions with a catalogue of the Very Large Array radio point sources and a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV/optical/near-IR photometry catalogue, revealing radio counterparts to 2 and HST counterparts to 6 of the X-ray sources. In addition, we also identify a radio source with the recently discovered millisecond pulsar PSR 1737-0314A. The brightest X-ray source, CX1, appears to be consistent with the nominal position of the classic nova Ophiuchi 1938 (Oph 1938), and both Oph 1938 and CX1 are consistent with a UV-bright variable HST counterpart, which we argue to be the source of the nova eruption in 1938. This makes Oph 1938 the second classic nova recovered in a Galactic GC since Nova T Scorpii in M80. CX2 is consistent with the steep-spectrum radio source VLA8, which unambiguously matches a faint blue source; the steepness of VLA8 is suggestive of a pulsar nature, possibly a transitional millisecond pulsar with a late K dwarf companion, though an active galactic nucleus (AGN) cannot be ruled out. The other counterparts to the X-ray sources are all suggestive of chromospherically active binaries or background AGNs, so their nature requires further membership information.

  We analyze JWST NIRSpec$+$MIRI/MRS observations of the infrared (IR) gas-phase molecular bands of the most enshrouded source (D1) within the interacting system and luminous IR galaxy II Zw 096. We report the detection of rovibrational lines of H$_2$O $\nu_2$=1-0 ($\sim$5.3-7.2 $\mu$m) and $^{12}$CO $\nu$=1-0 ($\sim$4.45-4.95 $\mu$m) in D1. The CO band shows the R- and P-branches in emission and the spectrum of the H$_2$O band shows the P-branch in emission and the R-branch in absorption. The H$_2$O R-branch in absorption unveils an IR-bright embedded compact source in D1 and the CO broad component features a highly turbulent environment. From both bands, we also identified extended intense star-forming (SF) activity associated with circumnuclear photodissociation regions (PDRs), consistent with the strong emission of the ionised 7.7 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon band in this source. By including the 4.5-7.0 $\mu$m continuum information derived from the H$_2$O and CO analysis, we modelled the IR emission of D1 with a dusty torus and SF component. The torus is very compact (diameter of $\sim$3 pc at 5 $\mu$m) and characterised by warm dust ($\sim$ 370 K), giving an IR surface brightness of $\sim$3.6$\times$10$^{8}$ L$_{\rm sun}$/pc$^2$. This result suggests the presence of a dust-obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) in D1, which has an exceptionally high covering factor that prevents the direct detection of AGN emission. Our results open a new way to investigate the physical conditions of inner dusty tori via modelling the observed IR molecular bands.

  Under the hypothesis of gravitational redshift induced by the central supermassive black hole, and based on line widths and shifts of redward shifted H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ broad emission lines for more than 8000 SDSS DR7 AGNs, we measure the virial factor in determining supermassive black hole masses. The virial factor had been believed to be independent of accretion radiation pressure on gas clouds in broad-line region (BLR), and only dependent on inclination effects of BLR. The virial factor measured spans a very large range. For the vast majority of AGNs ($&gt;$96%) in our samples, the virial factor is larger than $f=1$ usually used in literatures. The $f$ correction makes the percent of high-accreting AGNs decrease by about 100 times. There are positive correlations of $f$ with the dimensionless accretion rate and Eddington ratio. The redward shifts of H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ are mainly the gravitational origin, confirmed by a negative correlation between the redward shift and the dimensionless radius of BLR. Our results show that radiation pressure force is a significant contributor to the measured virial factor, containing the inclination effects of BLR. The usually used values of $f$ should be corrected for high-accreting AGNs, especially high redshift quasars. The $f$ correction increases their masses by one--two orders of magnitude, which will make it more challenging to explain the formation and growth of supermassive black holes at high redshifts.
