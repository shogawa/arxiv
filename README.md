  Giant Radio Galaxies (GRGs) are Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with radio emission that extends over projected sizes $&gt;0.7\,$Mpc. The large angular sizes associated with GRGs complicate their identification in radio survey images using traditional source finders. In this Note, we use DRAGNhunter, an algorithm designed to find double-lobed radio galaxies, to search for GRGs in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey (FIRST). Radio and optical images of identified candidates are visually inspected to confirm their authenticity, resulting in the discovery of $63$ previously unreported GRGs.

  We investigate the black hole mass function (BHMF) and Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF) of broad-line AGNs at z=4, based on a sample of 52 quasars with i&lt;23.2 at 3.50 &lt; z &lt; 4.25 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) S16A-Wide2 dataset, and 1,462 quasars with i&lt;20.2 in the same redshift range from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 quasar catalog. Virial BH masses of quasars are estimated using the width of the CIV 1549{\AA} line and the continuum luminosity at 1350{\AA}. To obtain the intrinsic broad-line AGN BHMF and ERDF, we correct for the incompleteness in the low-mass and/or low-Eddington-ratio ranges caused by the flux-limited selection. The resulting BHMF is constrained down to $\log M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}\sim7.5$. In comparison with broad-line AGN BHMFs at z=2 in the literature, we find that the number density of massive SMBHs peaks at higher redshifts, consistent with the "down-sizing" evolutionary scenario. Additionally, the resulting ERDF shows a negative dependence on BH mass, suggesting more massive SMBHs tend to accrete at lower Eddington ratios at z=4. With the derived intrinsic broad-line AGN BHMF, we also evaluate the active fraction of broad-line AGNs among the entire SMBH population at z=4. The resulting active fraction may suggest a positive dependence on BH mass. Finally, we examine the time evolution of broad-line AGN BHMF between z=4 and 6 through solving the continuity equation. The results suggest that the broad-line AGN BHMFs at z=4-6 only show evolution in their normalization, but with no significant changes in their shape.

  Non-thermal components in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) such as turbulence, magnetic field, and cosmic rays imprint the past and current energetic activities of jets from active galactic neuclie (AGN) of member galaxies as well as disturbance caused by galaxy cluster mergers. Meter- and centimeter-radio observations of synchrotron radiation allow us to diagnose the nonthermal component. Here we report on our discovery of an unidentified diffuse radio source, named the Flying Fox, near the center of the Abell 1060 field. The Flying Fox has an elongated ring-like structure and a central bar shape, but there is no obvious host galaxy. The average spectral index of the Flying Fox is -1.4, which is steeper than those for radio sources seen at meter wavelength. We discussed the possibilities of radio lobes, phoenixes, radio halos and relics, and Odd Radio Circle (ORC). In conclusion, the Flying Fox is not clearly explained by known radio sources.

  Highly collimated relativistic jets are a defining feature of certain active galactic nuclei (AGN), yet their formation mechanism remains elusive. Previous observations and theoretical models have proposed that the ambient medium surrounding the jets could exert pressure, playing a crucial role in shaping the jets. However, direct observational confirmation of such a medium has been lacking. In this study, we present very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations of 3C 84 (NGC 1275), located at the center of the Perseus Cluster. Through monitoring observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43 GHz, a jet knot was detected to have been ejected from the sub-parsec scale core in the late 2010s. Intriguingly, this knot propagated in a direction significantly offset from the parsec-scale jet direction. To delve deeper into the matter, we employ follow-up VLBA 43 GHz observations, tracing the knot's trajectory until the end of 2022. We discovered that the knot abruptly changed its trajectory in the early 2020s, realigning itself with the parsec-scale jet direction. Additionally, we present results from an observation of 3C 84 with the Global VLBI Alliance (GVA) at 22 GHz, conducted near the monitoring period. By jointly analyzing the GVA 22 GHz image with a VLBA 43 GHz image observed about one week apart, we generated a spectral index map, revealing an inverted spectrum region near the edge of the jet where the knot experienced deflection. These findings suggest the presence of a dense, cold ambient medium characterized by an electron density exceeding $\sim10^5\ {\rm cm^{-3}}$, which guides the jet's propagation on parsec scales and significantly contributes to the overall shaping of the jet.

  Spatially resolved observations of AGN host galaxies undergoing feedback processes are one of the most relevant avenues through which galactic evolution can be studied, given the long lasting effects AGN feedback has on gas reservoirs, star formation, and AGN environments at all scales. Within this context we report results from VLT/MUSE integral field optical spectroscopy of TN J1049-1258, one of the most powerful radio sources known, at a redshift of 3.7. We detected extended ($\sim$ 18 kpc) Lyman $\alpha$ emission, spatially aligned with the radio axis, redshifted by 2250 $\pm$ 60 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the host galaxy systemic velocity, and co-spatial with UV continuum emission. This Lyman $\alpha$ emission could arise from a companion galaxy, although there are arguments against this interpretation. Alternatively, it might correspond to an outflow of ionized gas stemming from the radio galaxy. The outflow would be the highest redshift spatially resolved ionized outflow to date. The enormous amount of energy injected, however, appears to be unable to quench the host galaxy's prodigious star formation, occurring at a rate of $\sim$4500 M$_{\odot} yr^{-1}$, estimated using its far infra-red luminosity. Within the field we also found two companion galaxies at projected distances of $\sim$25 kpc and $\sim$60 kpc from the host, which suggests the host galaxy is harbored within a protocluster.

  We explore the potential of using the low-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest surrounding luminous red galaxies (LRGs) as a tool to constrain active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback models. Our analysis is based on snapshots from the Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulations at a redshift of $z=0.1$. These simulations offer an ideal platform for studying the influence of AGN feedback on the gas surrounding galaxies, as they share the same initial conditions and underlying code but incorporate different feedback prescriptions. Both simulations show significant impacts of feedback on the temperature and density of the gas around massive halos. Following our previous work, we adjusted the UV background in both simulations to align with the observed number density of Ly$\alpha$ lines ($\rm dN/dz$) in the intergalactic medium and study the Ly$\alpha$ forest around massive halos hosting LRGs, at impact parameters ($r_{\perp}$) ranging from 0.1 to 100 pMpc. Our findings reveal that $\rm dN/dz$, as a function of $r_{\perp}$, is approximately 1.5 to 2 times higher in IllustrisTNG compared to Illustris up to $r_{\perp}$ of $\sim 10$ pMpc. To further assess whether existing data can effectively discern these differences, we search for archival data containing spectra of background quasars probing foreground LRGs. Through a feasibility analysis based on this data, we demonstrate that ${\rm dN/dz} (r_{\perp})$ measurements can distinguish between feedback models of IllustrisTNG and Illustris with a precision exceeding 12$\sigma$. This underscores the potential of ${\rm dN/dz} (r_{\perp})$ measurements around LRGs as a valuable benchmark observation for discriminating between different feedback models.

  Overdense regions at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 2$) are perfect laboratories to study the relations between environment and SMBH growth, and the AGN feedback processes on the surrounding galaxies and diffuse gas. In this white paper, we discuss how AXIS will 1) constrain the AGN incidence in protoclusters, as a function of parameters such as redshift, overdensity, mass of the structure; 2) search for low-luminosity and obscured AGN in the satellite galaxies of luminous QSOs at $z&gt;6$, exploiting the large galaxy density around such biased objects; 3) probe the AGN feedback on the proto-ICM via the measurement of the AGN contribution to the gas ionization and excitation, and the detection of extended X-ray emission from the ionized gas and from radio jets; 4) discover new large-scale structures in the wide and deep AXIS surveys as spikes in the redshift distribution of X-ray sources. These goals can be achieved only with an X-ray mission with the capabilities of AXIS, ensuring a strong synergy with current and future state-of-the-art facilities in other wavelengths.

Prospects for AGN Studies with AXIS: AGN Fueling -- Resolving Hot Gas
  inside Bondi Radius of SMBHs

  Hot gas around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) should be captured within the gravitational "sphere of influence", characterized by the Bondi radius. Deep Chandra observations have spatially resolved the Bondi radii of at least five nearby SMBHs. Contrary to earlier hot accretion models that predicted a steep temperature increase within the Bondi radius, none of the resolved temperature profiles exhibit such an increase. The temperature inside the Bondi radius appears to be complex, indicative of a multi-temperature phase of hot gas with a cooler component at about 0.2-0.3 keV. The density profiles within the Bondi regions are shallow, suggesting the presence of strong outflows. These findings might be explained by recent realistic numerical simulations that suggest that large-scale accretion inside the Bondi radius can be chaotic, with cooler gas raining down in some directions and hotter gas outflowing in others. With an angular resolution similar to Chandra and a significantly larger collecting area, AXIS will collect enough photons to map the emerging accretion flow within and around the "sphere of influence" of a sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). AXIS will reveal transitions in the inflow that ultimately fuels the AGN, as well as outflows that provide feedback to the environment.

  Jets powered by AGN in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim 6$) have the potential to not only define the trajectories of the first-forming massive galaxies but to enable the accelerated growth of their associated SMBHs. Under typical assumptions, jets could even rectify observed quasars with light seed formation scenarios; however, not only are constraints on the parameters of the first jets lacking, observations of these objects are scarce. Owing to the significant energy density of the CMB at these epochs capable of quenching radio emission, observations will require powerful, high angular resolution X-ray imaging to map and characterize these jets. As such, \textit{AXIS} will be necessary to understand early SMBH growth and feedback.

  This study presents the capabilities of the AXIS telescope in estimating redshifts from X-ray spectra alone (X-ray redshifts, XZs). Through extensive simulations, we establish that AXIS observations enable reliable XZ estimates for more than 5500 obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) up to redshift $z\sim 6$ in the proposed deep (7 Ms) and intermediate (375 ks) surveys. Notably, at least 1600 of them are expected to be in the Compton-Thick regime ($\log N_H/\mathrm{cm^{-2}}\geq 24$), underscoring the pivotal role of AXIS in sample these elusive objects that continue to be poorly understood. XZs provide an efficient alternative for optical/infrared faint sources, overcoming the need for time-consuming spectroscopy, potential limitations of photometric redshifts, and potential issues related to multi-band counterpart association. This approach will significantly enhance the accuracy of constraints on the X-ray luminosity function and obscured AGN fractions up to high redshift.
