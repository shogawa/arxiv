  Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at high redshifts are considered key contributors to cosmic reionization at $z&gt;6$ due to their higher ionization efficiencies. We have identified 119 H$\beta$ + [OIII] emitters at $z\sim7$ selected by a flux excess in the medium-band filter F410M in the public James Webb Space Telescope Cycle-1 fields. Our emitters exhibit a wide range in rest-frame H$\beta$ + [OIII] equivalent width (EWs), 420 $&lt;$ EW$_{0}$/\r{A} $&lt;$ 6850 (with the median value of $\sim1700$ \r{A}). Among them, 19 are EW$_{0}$ $&gt;$ 3000 \r{A}, which represent extreme populations even in the context of recent findings with JWST. They are characterized by (i) low stellar mass ($\sim 3\times10^{7}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), (ii) blue colors ($\beta_{\rm UV}\sim -2.2$), and (iii) low dust attenuation ($A_{\mathrm{V}}\sim 0.1$ mag). We discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed high rest-frame H$\beta$ + [OIII] EWs, including (1) photoionization by AGN, (2) stellar photoionization in the vicinity of HII regions, and (3) radiative shocks powered by outflows either from AGN or massive stars. Notably, we find 13 emitters with spatially offset H$\beta$ + [OIII] emission compared to the UV and stellar components. Given the absence of obvious signatures of actively accreting black holes, these emitters are likely under strong feedback-driven winds from massive stars. Lastly, we report a unique overdensity of EELGs in one of the observed fields. The discovery of such a "star-bursting" overdensity supports the idea that large ionizing bubbles formed around some EEGLs in the early Universe.

  Recent studies have focused on the low-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ forest as a potential constraint on galactic feedback, as different AGN and stellar feedback models in hydrodynamic simulations produce varying intergalactic medium (IGM) statistics. However, existing low-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ forest data provide insufficient observational constraints for simulations due to their low precision and the lack of observations from $z \sim 0.4$ to $1.8$. The Habitable Worlds Observatory, equipped with an ultraviolet (FUV / NUV) spectrograph, could provide transformative data for this science by increasing both absorbers in the redshift range where current data are lacking and increasing the precision of the Ly$\alpha$ forest observational data at $z \leq 0.4$. This spectrograph should cover the wavelengths $1215-3402$ \AA~and have a spectral resolution of $R =$~40,000. Distinguishing between certain active-galactic nuclei feedback models requires high precision ($\sim 5-10$\%) measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest 1D transmitted flux power spectrum for $z\leq 1.8$. This requires $\sim 830$ QSO spectra with S/N~$\geq5$ - $25$ depending on redshift. This data would also enable a comprehensive study on the thermal state of the IGM across time, and address the tension between the observed and simulated Ly$\alpha$ forest $b$-value distribution.

  We analyzed the deepest Hubble Space Telescope (HST) F275W ultraviolet (UV) imaging of M87 to obtain the most robust constraints on its star formation rate (SFR) and star formation history (SFH). After removing the galaxy continuum and globular clusters, we detected an excess of UV point sources near the center. By comparing their colors to young stellar source (YSS) colors generated by stochastically simulated star formation (SF) for various SFRs and SFHs, we ruled out their origin as a UV-upturn population and identified them as YSS. We found an extremely low SFR of $\sim 2\times10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in M87, with evidence of a weak starburst $\sim$125 Myr ago that formed $\sim 1000$ M$_\odot$ of stars. Unlike other cool-core clusters where SF is stronger and directly linked to cooling gas, we found no spatial correlation between YSS and H$\alpha$ filaments. Comparing SF activity with M87's AGN outburst history suggests that recent AGN feedback events ($\lesssim$12 Myr ago) neither triggered nor were associated with any detectable SF, however, earlier outbursts may have triggered weak starbursts. We detected UV filaments co-spatial with H$\alpha$ filaments with similar lengths and widths, though they are obscured by dust near the center. These filaments are likely powered by metal-line emission from collisional ionization, suggesting ongoing low-level precipitation of the intracluster medium. Our results indicate that AGN feedback has quenched SF significantly in M87 for at least 200 Myr, even though some precipitation persists. Additionally, we identified a hotspot created by the counterjet, with the spectral index also constrained.

  In this study, we explore the properties of diffuse intergalactic gas residing in the outskirts of the four nearby, low-mass galaxy groups NGC1052, NGC5866, NGC4631, and NGC3992 (all at cz&lt;2000 km/s) beyond their group virial radii. Using archival ultraviolet absorption spectra of bright AGN observed with HST/COS, we search for HI Ly a absorption near the groups' recession velocities along 35 sightlines that pass the outer group medium (OGrM) at normalized impact parameters rho/Rvir=1-3. We derive HI column densities of the absorbers and constrain the physical conditions in the gas by using a hydrostatic toy model of the groups' gas environment and assuming photoionization. HI Ly absorption near the groups' recession velocities is detected along 19 sightlines with HI column densities in the range log N(HI)=12.50-14.34, implying a high OGrM detection rate of more than 50 percent. We transform this value into an incidence rate of OGrM absorbers per unit redshift of dN/dz=232pm58.This is 25 percent above the value derived for the general population of Ly a absorbers within z = 0 filaments and more than twice the value for the z = 0 Ly a forest. From the modeling, we obtain lower limits for the gas densities from log n_H=-5.00 to -3.72, comparable to densities found in the overall Ly a forest. Our study unveils a large cross section and overdensity of Ly a absorbers in the outskirts of these four nearby groups. Such an overdensity is in line with a previously proposed scenario, in which AGN feedback lifts gaseous material to large distances beyond the virial radius of groups into the OGrM. However, a larger survey of OGrM absorbers and a comparison with hydrodynamical simulations will be necessary to constrain the cosmological mass density of OGrM absorbers and pinpoint their role in cosmological structure formation and galaxy/group evolution.   

A Torus Remnant Revealed by the Infrared Echo of TDE AT2019qiz:
  Implications for the Missing Energy and QPE Formation

  AT2019qiz is the first standard optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with detection of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), providing strong evidence for TDE-QPE association. Moreover, it belongs to the rare subset of optical TDEs with prominent infrared (IR) echoes revealed by the multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The IR light curve shows an early bump, followed by a steady rise until the second-to-last epoch, after which it appears to enter a plateau phase. The dust temperature decreased until the fourth epoch and remains approximately constant for the subsequent five epochs. We have fitted the last five epochs using a convex dust ring model, resulting in an inner radius $&gt;1.2$ pc. Such a large radius greatly exceeds the inner radius of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus for a $10^6\,M_{\odot}$ black hole and thus could be a torus remnant with the inner part having vanished, further supporting the unified scenario of recently faded AGNs, TDEs, and QPEs. Consequently, a connection between QPEs and IR-bright TDEs is naturally expected. Moreover, the echo requires at least a peak bolometric luminosity of $(6.6, 9.5, 1.0)\times 44 \,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ assuming silicate, silicon carbide, and graphite dust grains, respectively, all of which are significantly higher than the peak optical blackbody luminosity. It adds to the accumulating evidence that the missing energy of TDEs may lie in the unobservable extreme UV. This work highlights the unique value of IR echoes in the study of TDEs and QPEs, and a promising prospect in the era of the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, the successor to WISE.
