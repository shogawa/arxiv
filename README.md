  We present the results of a study investigating the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), size-mass relations and morphological properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range $0.25&lt;z&lt;2.25$, using the JWST PRIMER survey. The depth of the PRIMER near-IR imaging allows us to confirm the double Schechter function shape of the quiescent GSMF out to $z\simeq2.0$, via a clear detection of the upturn at $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star}/ M_{\odot}) \leq 10$ thought to be induced by environmental quenching. In addition to the GSMF, we confirm that quiescent galaxies can be split into separate populations at $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \simeq 10$, based on their size-mass relations and morphologies. We find that low-mass quiescent galaxies have more disk-like morphologies (based on S\'ersic index, Gini coefficient and $M_{20}$ metrics) and follow a shallower size-mass relation than their high-mass counterparts. Indeed, the slope of the size-mass relation followed by low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies, albeit with a lower normalization. Moreover, within the errors, the evolution in the median size of low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies ($R_{e}\propto(1+z)^{-0.25\pm0.03})$, and significantly less rapid than that displayed by high-mass quiescent galaxies ($R_{e}\propto (1+z)^{-1.14\pm 0.03})$. Overall, our results are consistent with low and high-mass quiescent galaxies following different quenching pathways. The evolution of low-mass quiescent galaxies is qualitatively consistent with the expectations of external/environmental quenching (e.g. ram-pressure stripping). In contrast, the evolution of high-mass quiescent galaxies is consistent with internal/mass quenching (e.g. AGN feedback) followed by size growth driven by minor mergers.

  Astrophysical relativistic outflows are launched as Poynting-flux-dominated, yet the mechanism governing efficient magnetic dissipation, which powers the observed emission, is still poorly understood. We study magnetic energy dissipation in relativistic "striped" jets, which host current sheets separating magnetically dominated regions with opposite field polarity. The effective gravity force $g$ in the rest frame of accelerating jets drives the Kruskal-Schwarzschild instability (KSI), a magnetic analogue of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. By means of 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we study the linear and non-linear evolution of the KSI. The linear stage is well described by linear stability analysis. The non-linear stages of the KSI generate thin (skin-depth-thick) current layers, with length comparable to the dominant KSI wavelength. There, the relativistic drift-kink mode and the tearing mode drive efficient magnetic dissipation. The dissipation rate can be cast as an increase in the effective width $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ of the dissipative region, which follows $d\Delta_{\rm eff}/dt\simeq 0.05 \sqrt{\Delta_{\rm eff}\,g}$. Our results have important implications for the location of the dissipation region in gamma-ray burst and AGN jets.

  Most of the visible matter in the Universe is in a gaseous state, subject to hydrodynamic forces and galaxy formation processes that are much more complex to model than gravity. These baryonic effects can potentially bias the analyses of several cosmological probes, such as weak gravitational lensing. In this work, we study the gas density and velocity fields of the FLAMINGO simulations and compare them with their gravity-only predictions. We find that, while the gas velocities do not differ from those of dark matter on large scales, the gas mass power spectrum is suppressed by up to $\approx 8\%$ relative to matter, even on gigaparsec scales. This is a consequence of star formation depleting gas in the densest and most clustered regions of the universe. On smaller scales, $k&gt;0.1 \, h / \rm Mpc$, the power suppression for both gas densities and velocities is more significant and correlates with the strength of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The impact of feedback can be understood in terms of outflows, identified as gas bubbles with positive radial velocities ejected from the central galaxy. With increasing feedback strength, the outflowing gas has higher velocities, and it reaches scales as large as $10$ times the virial radius of the halo, redistributing the gas and slowing its average infall velocity. Interestingly, different implementations of AGN feedback leave distinct features in these outflows in terms of their radial and angular profiles and their dependence on halo mass. In the future, such differences could be measured in observations using, for example, the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.

  Optically dark dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) play an essential role in massive galaxy formation at early cosmic time, however their nature remains elusive. Here we present a detailed case study of all the baryonic components of a $z=4.821$ DSFG, XS55. Selected from the ultra-deep COSMOS-XS 3GHz map with a red SCUBA-2 450$\mu$m/850$\mu$m colour, XS55 was followed up with ALMA 3mm line scans and spectroscopically confirmed to be at $z=4.821$ via detections of the CO(5-4) and [CI](1-0) lines. JWST/NIRCam imaging reveals that XS55 is a F150W-dropout with red F277W/F444W colour, and a complex morphology: a compact central component embedded in an extended structure with a likely companion. XS55 is tentatively detected in X-rays with both Chandra and XMM-Newton, suggesting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) nature. By fitting a panchromatic SED spanning NIR to radio wavelengths, we revealed that XS55 is a massive main-sequence galaxy with a stellar mass of $M_\ast=(5\pm1)\times10^{10}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ and a star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=540\pm177~{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. The dust of XS55 is optically thick in the far infrared (FIR) with a surprisingly cold dust temperature of $T_{\rm dust}=33\pm2\,{\rm K}$, making XS55 one of the coldest DSFGs at $z&gt;4$ known to date. This work unveils the nature of a radio-selected F150W-dropout, suggesting the existence of a population of DSFGs hosting active black holes embedded in optically thick dust.

  Radio observations provide a powerful tool to constrain the assembly of galaxies over cosmic time. Recent deep and wide radio continuum surveys have improved significantly our understanding on radio emission properties of AGNs and SFGs across $0 &lt; z &lt; 4$. This allows us to derive an empirical model of the radio continuum emission of galaxies based on their SFR and the probability of hosting an radio AGN. We make use of the Empirical Galaxy Generator (EGG) to generate a near-infrared-selected, flux-limited multi-wavelength catalog to mimic real observations. Then we assign radio continuum flux densities to galaxies based on their SFRs and the probability of hosting a radio-AGN of specific 1.4 GHz luminosity. We also apply special treatments to reproduce the clustering signal of radio AGNs.Our empirical model successfully recovers the observed 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of both AGN and SFG populations, as well as the differential number counts at various radio bands. The uniqueness of this approach also allows us to directly link radio flux densities of galaxies to other properties, including redshifts, stellar masses, and magnitudes at various photometric bands. We find that roughly half of the radio continuum sources to be detected by SKA at $z \sim 4-6$ will be too faint to be detected in the optical survey ($r \sim 27.5$) carried out by Rubin observatory. Unlike previous studies which utilized RLFs to reproduce ERB, our work starts from a simulated galaxy catalog with realistic physical properties. It has the potential to simultaneously, and self-consistently reproduce physical properties of galaxies across a wide range of wavelengths, from optical, NIR, FIR to radio wavelengths. Our empirical model can shed light on the contribution of different galaxies to the extragalactic background light, and greatly facilitates designing future multiwavelength galaxy surveys.
