  This study investigates the radio spectral properties of \textit{K}$_{S}$-selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the XMM-LSS field using extensive multiwavelength data. By employing various diagnostics, SFGs are distinguished from quiescent galaxies and AGN across seven redshift bins ($\rm{0.1\leq\,\textit{z}\,\leq\,3.0}$). The broadband radio frequency spectral energy distribution is analysed at observer-frame frequencies from 144 to 1500 MHz using median stacking techniques correcting for median flux boosting. We investigate the relationship between the radio spectral index, $\alpha$ (where $S\propto\nu^{\alpha}$) and redshift ($z$). Our analysis reveals no significant inverse correlation between $\alpha$ and $z$, indicating that the radio spectrum remains independent with varying redshift. We fit the stacked median radio SEDs with a power law (\textit{PL}), curved power law (\textit{CPL}) and double power law (\textit{DPL}) models. For the \textit{DPL} and \textit{CPL} models, we observe a consistent steepening of the low-frequency spectral index across all redshift bins. For the \textit{CPL} model, the curvature term $q$ is greater than zero in all redshift bins. Model comparisons indicate that spectra are generally well fitted by all the models considered. At 1500 MHz, SFGs display both a steep synchrotron component and a flat free-free emission component, with a thermal fraction consistently around 11$\%$ to 18$\%$. Further deep radio observations, with higher resolution to better deal with source blending and confusion noise and wider frequency coverage to better separate non-thermal and thermal radio emission, are required to reveal the detailed physical processes, thus clarifying the nature of radio sources.

  The origin of compact millimeter (mm) continuum emission from radio-quiet AGNs (RQAGNs) is still not fully understood. Changing-state AGNs (CSAGNs) display rapid and strong variability, which can allow us to investigate the origin of the mm emission. We present here the results of the first study of the mm continuum variability of a CSAGN using archival ALMA band 6 ($\sim 230$ GHz) observations of NGC 1566 obtained in 2014-2023. We find a positive correlation between the mm and X-ray flux with an intrinsic scatter of 0.05 dex ($1\sigma$), suggesting a common origin. The mm spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm mm}$) is found in the range of $0.13\pm0.38$ to $-0.26\pm0.53$, consistent with a compact optically thick synchrotron source. No significant correlation was found between the $\alpha_{\rm mm}$ and the mm flux. The mm/X-ray ratio also shows no clear link to the Eddington ratio but is higher in the low-accretion state. We discuss several scenarios about the origin of the mm emission in NGC 1566. We find that synchrotron emission in the magnetized X-ray corona appears to be the most probable origin of mm emission, confirming that mm emission can be used as a tracer of AGN activity in RQAGNs.

  One of the most mysterious results from observations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the detection of numerous, high-redshift, very red, extremely compact, broad-line sources termed ``little red dots'' (LRDs). It is unclear whether the LRDs belong to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or simply a collection of very compact star clusters. We build spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 29 LRDs at $z \approx 3-8.5$ based on JWST photometric and spectroscopic observations. We find that the V-shaped SEDs of these LRDs exhibit a roughly similar break frequency at $\nu_{\rm b}=10^{14.96\pm0.06}$ Hz, which corresponds to $\lambda_{\rm b}=3287_{-424}^{+487} \text{\AA}$ in the rest frame. We propose that this unique SED can be explained by the combination of an inner standard disk and an outer gravitationally unstable accretion disk with Toomre parameter $Q\sim1$. The outer disk has a temperature of $\sim2000-4000$ K for typical AGN parameters, which can well reproduce the near-infrared to optical bump as observed in LRDs. This model can naturally explain the strong infrared to optical emission and the V-shaped SED with a similar break frequency $\simeq 10^{15}$ Hz for LRDs without invoking strong dust extinction or unusual stellar contribution from a host galaxy. Most LRDs stay in sub-Eddington state based on the SED modeling, which are intrinsically weak in X-rays.

  Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are approaching the sensitivity required to resolve for the first time gravitational wave (GW) signals from individual supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, the large uncertainty in the localisation of the source will make the identification of its host environment challenging. We show how the posterior probability function of binary parameters inferred by the standard GW analysis can be converted into distributions of apparent magnitudes of the host galaxy in the infrared (IR) and optical bands. We do so for two different scenarios: one in which the host is a regular early-type galaxy (ETG), and one in which the binary resides in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate the binary parameter space PTAs can cover in the near and intermediate future and estimate whether their hosts will be detectable in all-sky electromagnetic surveys. A PTA with a baseline of 20 years and 116 pulsars, resembling the upcoming data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA)can detect binaries out to a luminosity distance of 2Gpc (which corresponds to a redshift of $z \approx 0.36$) under the most optimistic scenario for detection, while a PTA with a baseline of 30 years and 200 pulsars can reach out to a maximum distance slightly greater than 3Gpc ($z \approx 0.53$). We find that the host galaxies of all binaries that are detectable by a PTA with a baseline of 20 years are above the threshold for the WISE and SuperCOSMOS, and therefore they are expected to be present in those surveys, if they lie outside the Milky Way plane. 2MASS becomes incomplete for hosts of binary systems more massive than $10^{9.8}$ solar masses located at a luminosity distance from Earth greater than 1 Gpc. The EM surveys become slightly more incomplete when we consider the sensitivity of PTAs with baselines of 25 and 30 years, as PTAs can detect binaries to larger distances.
