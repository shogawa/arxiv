We present a spectroscopic study of photometrically identified extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs) with observed-frame equivalent widths (EWs) &gt;5000 A of either H alpha or H beta + [OIII] in the CEERS legacy deep field utilizing JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, RUBIES, THRILS and CEERS surveys. This master sample allows for performance tests of photometric selections and unveils what types of sources, either AGN or young star formation, were producing excessive ionizing radiation in the early Universe. We identify AGN through broad H alpha emission-lines and report 6 new broad-line AGN at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7 identified by the deep (~8 hr) G395M THRILS survey. We investigate the photometrically selected EELGs in a color-color plot designed for ``Little Red Dot'' selection and demonstrate that it effectively removes AGN with non-extreme lines from the sample. EELGs with and without broad lines show similar optical line ratios. We compare emission-line morphology to EWs and continuum morphologies and find that [OIII] morphology is more compact at higher EW. ~10% of photometrically selected EELGs have broad Balmer lines, jumping to 35% in deep spectroscopy which indicates a significant fraction of photometrically selected EELGs may host AGN. However, many AGN selected as EELGs have incorrectly high photometric EWs. For sources with extreme emission-line EWs that pass our photometric criteria and host an AGN, we find that the narrow H alpha component dominates over the broad, especially in the highest-EW sources. This implies that even when an AGN is present, it does not dominate the extreme emission.

We present a computational framework for galactic evolution based on a coupled stochastic nonlinear oscillator, implemented with the \textbf{Stochastic Hopf Engine}. Gas density ($G$) and star formation rate ($S$) co-evolve through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, capturing the transition from quiescent stability to merger-driven starbursts. Scatter in dark matter halo properties, modeled as multiplicative noise via the \textbf{Euler--Maruyama method}, broadens the bifurcation into a regime where noise-induced bursts occur below the deterministic threshold.   Simulations reveal a periodic signature, the \textbf{Galactic Heartbeat}, emerging as a deterministic limit cycle validated by the \textbf{data3} resonance peak in the star-formation spectrum. A radial reduction yields an effective \textbf{Fokker--Planck equation} for burst amplitude; its stationary solution matches numerical PDFs, providing statistical closure.   Including differential shear $Ω(r)$ and spatially varying bifurcation fields reproduces spiral morphologies and AGN-driven quenching. Driving the growth parameter sub-critical ($r_{agn} &lt; 0$) yields ``Red and Dead'' cores via attractor collapse. Dark matter halo scatter suppresses mean star formation while enhancing intermittency, offering a minimal yet interpretable framework linking local feedback and global potentials to macroscopic galactic evolution.

We report milliarcsecond-scale VLBI detections of compact radio nuclei in four spiral-hosted, double-lobed radio-loud AGNs (spiral DRAGNs), a rare class that challenges the traditional association of powerful jets with elliptical hosts. Using public VLBI data archives, we identify compact cores in four sources and resolve parsec-scale jets in two of them. The VLBI components show low brightness temperatures ($T_{\rm b} \approx 10^9$ K in the core) and jet-to-counterjet ratios consistent with only mildly relativistic intrinsic speeds ($β\lesssim 0.6$ for inclinations $θ\lesssim 80^\circ$), indicating weakly powered pc-scale outflows. The low radio-Eddington ratios $\log(L_{\rm R,1.4\,GHz}/L_{\rm Edd}) \approx -5$ to $-8$ support this interpretation. Three objects lie on the fundamental plane of black hole activity, implying that global accretion-jet coupling in spiral DRAGNs is similar to that in other AGNs. Comparison with recent GRMHD simulations of thin-disk jets suggests that the VLBI-scale cores in spiral DRAGNs may trace an early or intermittently magnetized phase of jet launching. The coexistence of weak pc-scale jets and large kpc-scale lobes implies recurrent or long-duty-cycle jet activity in these late-type hosts.

It is widely believed that stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs) exist within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN), forming a distinct population termed ``accretion-modified star" (AMS). Gas from the dense disk accretes onto these AMSs, dissipating substantial gravitational energy through a mini-disk around the sMBHs, which drives powerful outflows that interact with the surrounding disk gas. In this study, we investigate two scenarios for AMS accretion: episodic Bondi explosions with hyper-Eddington accretion (Scenario A) and steady Eddington accretion (Scenario B). These outflows generate turbulence, facilitating outward angular momentum transport in the AGN disk via shock interactions and angular momentum exchange. We explore a broad parameter space-spanning the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($M_{\rm p}$), dimensionless accretion rate ($\dot{\mathscr{M}}_{\rm p}$), sMBH mass function, and spatial distribution-to calculate the effective viscosity parameter $α_{\rm AMS}$. Our analysis reveals the scaling relations $α_{\rm AMS}\proptoζM_{\rm p}^2\dot{\mathscr{M}}_{\rm p}$ for Scenario A and $α_{\rm AMS}\proptoζM_{\rm p}^{1.5}\dot{\mathscr{M}}_{\rm p}^{0.1}$ for Scenario B, where $ζ$ denotes the ratio of total sMBH mass to the SMBH disk mass. For $ζ={0.01}$ and $M_{\rm p}=10^8 M_\odot$, $α_{\rm AMS}$ ranges from $\sim{3\times10^{-4}}$ to ${0.01}$ (Scenario A) and $\sim{3\times10^{-3}}$ to ${0.04}$ (Scenario B) from the inner to outer disk regions. These results demonstrate that AMS feedback provides an efficient mechanism for angular momentum transport in AGN disks.

This paper investigates the physical and kinematic properties of dust-rich regions in a small sample of group-centered elliptical galaxies, emphasizing their connection with the hot X-ray emitting gas and detailed dust grain characteristics. Comprehensive multi-wavelength data, including H-alpha and CO emission detected by MUSE and ALMA, demonstrate the presence of dust clouds embedded within complex, hot X-ray atmospheres shaped by AGN feedback. X-ray images show bubbles and cavities surrounded by bright rims. We find that dust regions containing molecular gas traced by CO are preferentially located at the rims of these X-ray cavities, suggesting that AGN-driven outflows enhance the condensation of cold, dusty gas at these compressive interfaces. Kinematic measurements indicate that molecular and ionized gas phases are dynamically and spatially linked, supporting the framework of a multiphase medium arising from the top-down condensation rain in the hot plasma and related chaotic cold accretion. Crucially, spatial variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv show that regions where dust, CO, and H-alpha emission coincide exhibit notably smaller Rv values, implying steeper extinction curves and the predominance of smaller or less evolved dust grains within these mixed-phase environments. This contrasts with larger Rv values found elsewhere in the dust clouds, suggesting grain growth or survival mechanisms within shielded cold gas.

We present Cepheid-based distances to two canonical AGN: NGC 4303 (M 61) and NGC 1068. Data were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope with nonredundant time spacing over 12 visits for each target, and observations were made with the F555W and F814W filters. We found 32,694 point sources in NGC 4303, and 130 of these were determined to be strong Cepheid candidates with periods ranging ~$13-93$ days. In NGC 1068, we found 20,207 point sources, where 51 of these were strong Cepheid candidates with periods ~$14-92$ days. We fit the period$-$luminosity relationship, calibrated based on a geometric distance to the LMC by Riess et al. (2019), to our Cepheid candidates in each galaxy and correct for potential effects of metallicity. Using a distance constraint for the LMC given by Pietrzyński et al. (2019), this yields a distance modulus of $μ= 31.083 \pm 0.035$ mag for NGC 4303 and $μ= 30.150 \pm 0.106$ mag for NGC 1068. Thus, we measure distances of $D = 16.47 \pm 0.27$ Mpc to NGC 4303 and $D = 10.72 \pm 0.52$ Mpc to NGC 1068.

We test whether "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are dust-reddened, high-inclination counterparts of compact, blue broad-line AGNs ("Little Blue Dots", LBDs) powered by super-Eddington accretion. We model the central engine as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow whose funnel yields strongly anisotropic, intrinsically blue ionizing continua, coupled to an equatorially concentrated BLR and a dusty screen with modest covering factor. Using inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy, we show that the extreme broad Halpha equivalent widths (EWs) of JWST LRDs are reproduced with global BLR covering factors of only 15%, consistent with standard Type 1 AGNs. Large Balmer EWs arise because self-shadowing suppresses the high-inclination optical continuum while the BLR is illuminated by an EUV-rich SED. Weak high-ionization lines follow from orientation-dependent suppression of the XUV/soft X-ray continuum toward equatorial directions, without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous "cocoon". With a gray attenuation law of AV = 2.8 along LRD-selected sightlines, the fiducial model matches the V-shaped UV-optical continua and large Balmer decrements; strong Balmer breaks occur only for the most obscured views. A compact equatorial dust component tied to the BLR and normalized by energy conservation intercepts and reradiates only a small fraction of Lbol, producing a modest hot-dust bump and far-IR/sub-mm emission consistent with current limits and implying small dust masses. The model unifies LRD and LBD observables via orientation, predicting correlated trends in Halpha EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission.  

You can't see me: super-Eddington growth hindering X-ray detection in high-z broad-line AGNs

We revisit black hole mass estimates for high-redshift broad-line AGNs discovered with JWST by jointly analysing their broad emission lines and their systematic non-detections in deep Chandra imaging. Building upon the self-shadowed, super-Eddington accretion flow framework and the coronal over-cooling prescription of Madau &amp; Haardt (2024), we couple funnel-dependent Comptonization physics with slim-disc spectra from Kubota &amp; Done (2019) and explore the resulting parameter space through a full MCMC inference. Using the sample analysed by Lupi et al. (2024) and Maiolino et al. (2025), we show that X-ray weakness - manifested as extreme bolometric corrections, suppressed 2-10 keV luminosities, and non-detections in the 0.5-5 keV Chandra band - naturally arises when the corona is confined and radiatively over-cooled inside a narrow super-Eddington funnel. The combined broad line+X-ray analysis yields strongly bimodal posteriors: either very massive, very low-Eddington black holes (physically disfavoured), or a population of low-mass ($\sim 10^{6}-10^{7} ~M_{\odot}$) black holes accreting at $f_{\rm Edd} \gg 1$. The latter solution is strongly preferred for nearly all objects and returns masses consistent with, or lower than, local $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm star}$ relations, mitigating the extreme mass ratios implied by single-epoch virial estimators. The predicted intrinsic spectra are redder and exhibit reduced hard-X-ray output but higher bolometric luminosities, implying bolometric corrections larger than those typical of the local AGN population, yet consistent with low-redshift highly accreting counterparts. These results support a picture in which many JWST broad-line AGNs are powered by rapidly growing, super-Eddington black holes whose suppressed coronal emission and self-shadowed BLR geometry combine to mimic overmassive black holes at $z \gtrsim 6$.
