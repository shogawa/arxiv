  As part of the guaranteed time observations program Mid-Infrared Characterization Of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC), we used the medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST to study the nearby merger NGC6240. We aim to characterise the dual active galactic nuclei (AGN), the ionised gas outflows and the main properties of the interstellar medium over a mapped area of 6.6"x7.7". We obtained integral field spectroscopic mid-infrared data of NGC6240, resolving both nuclei for the first time in the full 5-28{\mu}m spectral range. We modelled the emission lines through a kinematic decomposition, finding that the fine-structure lines in the southern (S) nucleus are broader than for the northern (N) nucleus (full width at half maximum of $\geq$1500 vs ~700 km s^{-1} on average). High excitation lines, such as [NeV], [NeVI], and [MgV], are clearly detected in the N nucleus. In the S nucleus, the same lines can be detected but only after a decomposition of the PAH features in the integrated spectrum, due to a combination of a strong mid-IR continuum, the broad emission lines, and the intense star formation (SF). The SF is distributed all over the mapped FoV of 3.5kpc x 4.1kpc (projected), with the maximum located around the S nucleus. Both nuclear regions appear to be connected by a bridge region detected with all the emission lines. Based on the observed MRS line ratios and the high velocity dispersion ({\sigma}~600 km s^{-1}), shocks are also dominating the emission in this system. We detected the presence of outflows as a bubble north-west from the N nucleus and at the S nucleus. We estimated a ionised mass outflow rate of 1.4$\pm$0.3 M yr^{-1} and 1.8$\pm$0.2 M yr^{-1}, respectively. Given the derived kinetic power of these outflows, both the AGN and the starburst could have triggered them. [Abridged]

  Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc^2), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H_2 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H_2 line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H_2 cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H_2 cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.

  We analyzed a sample of $\sim$113,000 galaxies ($\rm z &lt; 0.3$) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, divided into star-forming, composite, Seyfert, and LINER types, to explore the relationships between UV-to-optical colors ($\rm u-r$), star formation rates (SFRs), specific star formation rates (sSFRs), stellar velocity dispersions ($\rm \sigma_{*}$), mass accretion rates onto the black hole ($\rm L_{[OIII]}/\sigma_{*}^{4}$), and Eddington ratios. Star-forming galaxies predominantly feature young, blue stars along the main-sequence (MS) line, while composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies deviate from this line, displaying progressively older stellar populations and lower SFRs. $\rm L_{[OIII]}/\sigma_{*}^{4}$ and Eddington ratios are highest in Seyfert galaxies, moderate in composite galaxies, and lowest in LINERs, with higher ratios associated with bluer colors, indicating a younger stellar population and stronger active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. These trends suggest a strong correlation between sSFRs and Eddington ratios, highlighting a close connection between AGN and star formation activities. These results may imply an evolutionary sequence where galaxies transition from blue star-forming galaxies to red LINERs, passing through composite and Seyfert phases, driven primarily by gas supply, with AGN feedback playing a secondary role. While both radio luminosities ($\rm L_{1.4GHz}$) and Eddington ratios correlate with SFRs, their trends differ on the SFR$-$stellar mass ($\rm M_{*}$) plane, with radio luminosities increasing with stellar mass along the MS line, and no direct connection between radio luminosities and Eddington ratios. These findings may provide new insights into the interplay between star formation, AGN activity, and radio emission in galaxies, shedding light on their evolutionary pathways.

  UHECR are evaluated in the frame role of different nuclei composition . Most of the past and present models are considering proton or iron as their main courier. Some attention has been paid to the role of the UHECR light nuclei in recent years. We update here the lightest nuclei UHECR model, able to explain the nearest AGN or Star Burst sources with the few observed Hot Spot clustering in AUGER and TA array data. Any additional components of the heaviest nuclei with the highest energy, more bent and smeared, may also fit recent AUGER and TA homogeneous records at those energy edges.

  We used random forest algorithms to classify all objects in a large portion of the sky, using optical light curves obtained, or built from images provided, by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We compare different selection sets based on alerts or complete light curves derived from different photometric selection algorithms. The AGN candidates thus selected are cross-matched with objects in the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) of local galaxies, with $M_*&lt;2\times10^{10}M_\odot$. The AGN nature of these candidates is verified and characterized using archival optical spectra from SDSS. We further establish the fraction of candidates with counterparts in the eROSITA data release 1 catalog of X-ray sources. From an initial sample of 506 candidates, 415 have good-quality spectra. Among these 415 objects, we found significant broad Balmer lines in the spectra for $86\%$ (357) of the candidates. When considering BPT classifications, an additional 5 candidates were confirmed, resulting in $87\%$ (362) confirmed candidates. Specifically, broad Balmer lines were detected in $94\%$-$98\%$ of the AGN candidates selected from complete light curves and in $80\%$ of those selected from the less frequent ZTF alerts. The black hole masses estimated from the spectra range from $2.2\times10^6M_\odot$ to $4.2\times10^7M_\odot$, reaching lower values for the candidates selected using the more sensitive light curves. The black hole masses obtained cluster around $0.1\%$ of the stellar mass of the host from the NSA catalog. Two-thirds of the AGN candidates are classified as Seyfert or Composite by their narrow emission line ratios (BPT diagnostics) while the rest are star-forming. Almost all the candidates classified as Seyfert and over $50\%$ of those classified as star-forming have significant BELs. We found X-ray counterparts for $67\%$ of the candidates that fall in the footprint of the eROSITA-DE DR1.

  ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are an abundant high-redshift population newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). They are characterized by a red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad Balmer emission lines (${\rm FWHM} \gtrsim 1000~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) that suggest an AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing the compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in the COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of $0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}2-0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}4$ (1-2 pkpc at their photometric redshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals that the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to result from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case (CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources ($m_{\rm F444W}=24.3$ and $24.8$) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and photometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has a faint off-centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual systems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD ($m_{\rm F444W}\gtrsim26$) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These discoveries suggest that the angular auto-correlation function (ACF) of LRDs exhibits a significant excess ($\sim3\times10^2$ times) on sub-arcsec (kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of JWST-found AGNs measured over $10^{\prime\prime}-100^{\prime\prime}$. Follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts and the construction of a larger sample are essential to advance our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black holes and the importance of mergers in the early universe.
