  We explore the evolution of the ~107 degree hot gas in normal galaxies out to redshift = 0.5 (lookback time = 5 Gyr), using X-ray luminosity functions (XLF) built from a sample of 575 normal galaxies with z &lt; 0.6 detected in five high galactic latitude Chandra wide-field surveys. After estimating the emission due to the hot gas component (reducing the sample to ~400 galaxies), we compared the XLF in three redshift bins (z = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5), finding increases in the number of galaxies per unit co-moving volume from z = 0.1 to 0.3 and then from z = 0.3 to 0.5. These XLF changes suggest a significant (~5s) X-ray luminosity evolution of the hot gas, with LX,GAS decreasing by a factor of 6-10 in the last 5 Gyr (from z = 0.5 to 0.1). The relative abundance of LX,GAS~1041 erg s-1 galaxies at higher z, suggests that high z, moderate LX,GAS galaxies may be the optimal target to solve the missing baryon problem. In early-type galaxies, this observational trend is qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the expected time-dependent mass-loss rate in cooling flow models without AGN feedback. In late-type galaxies, the observational trend is also qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the effect of the z-dependent SFR.

  In this work, we present the results of a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of the brightest AGNs detected in the XMM-Newton 1.75 Ms Ultra Narrow Deep Field. We analyzed 23 AGNs that have a luminosity range of $\sim 10^{42} - 10^{46}\, \rm{erg}\, \rm{s}^{-1}$ in the $2 - 10\, \rm{keV}$ energy band, redshifts up to 2.66, and $\sim 10,000$ X-ray photon counts in the $0.3 - 10\, \rm{keV}$ energy band. Our analysis confirms the Iwasawa-Taniguchi effect, an anti-correlation between the X-ray luminosity ($L_x$) and the Fe-k$\alpha$ Equivalent Width ($EW_{Fe}$) possibly associated with the decreasing of the torus covering factor as the AGN luminosity increases. We investigated the relationship among black hole mass ($M_{BH}$), $L_x$, and X-ray variability, quantified by the Normalized Excess Variance ($\sigma^2_{rms}$). Our analysis suggest an anti-correlation in both $M_{BH} - \sigma^2_{rms}$ and $L_x- \sigma^2_{rms}$ relations. The first is described as $\sigma^2_{rms} \propto M^{-0.26 \pm 0.05}_{BH}$, while the second presents a similar trend with $\sigma^2_{rms} \propto L_{x}^{-0.31 \pm 0.04}$. These results support the idea that the luminosity-variability anti-correlation is a byproduct of an intrinsic relationship between the BH mass and the X-ray variability, through the size of the emitting region. Finally, we found a strong correlation among the Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$), the hard X-ray photon index ($\Gamma$), and the illumination factor $\log(A)$, which is related to the ratio between the number of Compton scattered photons and the number of seed photons. The $\log(\lambda_{Edd})-\Gamma-\log(A)$ plane could arise naturally from the connection between the accretion flow and the hot corona.
