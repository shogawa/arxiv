  Forbidden collisionally excited optical atomic transitions from high ionization potential (IP$\geq$54.8\,eV) ions, such as Ca$^{\mathrm{4+}}$, Ne$^{\mathrm{4+}}$, Fe$^{\mathrm{6+}}$, Fe$^{\mathrm{10+}}$, Fe$^{\mathrm{13+}}$, Ar$^{\mathrm{9+}}$, and S$^{\mathrm{11+}}$, are known as optical coronal lines (CLs). The spectral energy distribution (SED) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) typically extends to hundreds of electron volts and above, which should be able to produce such highly ionized gas. However, optical CLs are often not detected in AGN. Here we use photoionization calculations with the \textsc{Cloudy} spectral synthesis code to determine possible reasons for the rarity of these optical CLs. We calculate CL luminosities and equivalent widths from radiation pressure confined photoionized gas slabs exposed to an AGN continuum. We consider the role of dust, metallicity, and ionizing SED in the formation of optical CLs. We find that (1) dust reduces the strength of most CLs by $\sim$three orders of magnitude, primarily as a result of depletion of metals onto the dust grains. (2) In contrast to the CLs, the more widely observed lower IP optical lines such as [O\, III] 5007\,\AA, are less affected by depletion and some are actually enhanced in dusty gas. (3) In dustless gas many optical CLs become detectable, and are particularly strong for a hard ionizing SED. This implies that prominent CL emission likely originate in dustless gas. Our calculations also suggest optical CL emission is enhanced in galaxies with low mass black holes characterized by a harder radiation field and a low dust to metal ratio. The fact that optical CLs are not widely observed in the early universe with JWST may point to rapid dust formation at high redshift.

  PG 1448+273 is a luminous, nearby ($z=0.0645$), narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy, which likely accretes close to the Eddington limit. Previous X-ray observations of PG 1448 with XMM-Newton in 2017 and NuSTAR in 2022 revealed the presence of an ultra fast outflow, as seen through its blueshifted iron K absorption profile, where the outflow velocity appeared to vary in the range $0.1-0.3c$. In this work, new X-ray observations of PG 1448 are presented, in the form of four simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations performed in July and August 2023. The X-ray spectra appeared at a similar flux in each observation, making it possible to analyze the mean 2023 X-ray spectrum at high signal to noise. A broad ($\sigma=1$ keV) and highly blue-shifted ($E=9.8\pm0.4$ keV) iron K absorption profile is revealed in the mean spectrum. The profile can be modeled by a fast, geometrically thick accretion disk wind, which reveals a maximum terminal velocity of $v_{\infty}=-0.43\pm0.03c$, one of the fastest known winds in a nearby AGN. As a result, the inferred mass outflow rate of the wind may reach a significant fraction of the Eddington accretion rate.

  We study the 3.4-4.4$\mu$m fundamental rovibrational band of H3+, a key tracer of the ionization of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM), in a sample of 12 local (d&lt; 400 Mpc) ultra/luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The P, Q, and R branches of the band are detected in 13 out of 20 analyzed regions within these U/LIRGs, which increases the number of extragalactic H3+ detections by a factor of 6. For the first time in the ISM, the H3+ band is observed in emission in 3 of these regions. In the remaining 10 regions, the band is seen in absorption. The absorptions are produced toward the 3.4-4.4$\mu$m hot dust continuum rather than toward the stellar continuum, indicating that they likely originate in clouds associated with the dust continuum source. The H3+ band is undetected in Seyfert-like U/LIRGs where the mildly obscured X-ray radiation from the AGN might limit the abundance of this molecule. For the detections, the H3+ abundances, N(H3+)/N_H = (0.5-5.5)x10^-7, imply relatively high ionization rates between 3x10^-16 and &gt;4x10^-15 s^-1, which are likely associated with high-energy cosmic rays. In half of the targets the absorptions are blue-shifted by 50-180 km/s, which are lower than the molecular outflow velocities measured using other tracers such as OH 119$\mu$m or rotational CO lines. This suggests that H3+ traces gas close to the outflow launching sites before it has been fully accelerated. We used nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium models to investigate the physical conditions of these clouds. In 7 out of 10 objects, the H3+ excitation is consistent with inelastic collisions with H2 in warm translucent molecular clouds (T_kin ~ 250-500 K and n(H2) ~ 10^(2-3) cm^-3). In three objects, dominant infrared pumping excitation is required to explain the absorptions from the (3,0) and (2,1) levels of H3+ detected for the first time in the ISM.
