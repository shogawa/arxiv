  Stars with outflows interacting with ambient gas experience accelerations arising from the gravitational feedback induced by the interaction structure. In this work, three-dimensional (3D) local shearing box simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of a star with outflows embedded in the outer regions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk. Two types of stellar wind are considered: isotropic winds and axisymmetric jets, along with variations in the radial pressure gradient profile. The results show that anti-friction enables AGN stars to acquire angular momentum from the ambient gas, resulting in outward migration away from the disk center. The formation and stability of the head-wind structure, which is crucial for maintaining anti-friction, are sensitive to both the strength of the stellar outflow and the radial pressure gradient of the disk gas. Once the head-wind structure is disrupted, the anti-friction effect ceases to operate effectively. A case study is also presented, focusing on a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) in an AGN disk. It is shown that jet material launched along the z-axis is confined to the trailing side of the object's motion by high gas inflow velocities, thereby activating anti-friction and inducing outward migration. If such an sBH migrates inward initially, the interplay between inward and outward migration may trap it at an equilibrium radius, potentially facilitating the formation and merger of black hole binaries.

  Compact binaries with accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes are crucial for understanding accretion physics. In this study, we identify accreting compact binary candidates in the eROSITA DR1 by combining Gaia astrometry and ZTF time-domain photometry. We select accreting compact binary candidates whose X-ray emission is likely accretion-driven, based on their X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors, and further identify systems with short-period ZTF light curves, thereby ruling out AGNs. The resulting 22 candidates, including two known compact binaries, represent promising candidates for spectroscopic follow-up to confirm their accreting nature and explore their physical properties. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining X-ray-to-optical flux ratio and optical color, and time-domain photometry in selecting accreting compact binaries. The method is scalable and adaptable to future multi-wavelength sky surveys, offering a promising path toward a more complete census of compact binaries in the Galaxy.

  We investigate the generation of magnetic fields above black hole accretion discs due to the non-zero curl of the disc radiation field. By self consistently computing the components of the radiation flux and their curl, we show that the rotational nature of the radiation field induces charge separation, leading to magnetic field generation in the plasma above the disc. Solving the magnetohydrodynamic equations, we derive the time evolution of these fields and demonstrate that they grow over astrophysically relevant timescales. For a standard Keplerian accretion disc, the produced magnetic fields remain weak, on the order of a few Gauss, consistent with previous predictions. However, when a luminous corona is present in the inner disc region ($r_d &lt; 3-10 r_g$), the generated fields reach dynamically significant strengths of up to $10^5$ Gauss where the magnetic energy density approaching few percentage of equipartition with the gas pressure. These fields develop within realistic growth timescales (such as viscous timescale) and can be dynamically significant in governing disc and jet evolution. Our findings suggest that radiation-driven magnetic fields play a crucial role in accretion flow magnetization, influencing both disc dynamics and observational signatures. The predicted field strengths could affect the thermal emission, synchrotron radiation, and polarization properties of black hole accretion systems, with implications for X-ray binaries, AGN, and jet formation. Future numerical simulations and high-resolution polarimetric observations, such as those from IXPE, eXTP, and EHT, may provide observational confirmation of our findings.

  Recently, the gravitational wave (GW) event for black hole (BH)-BH mergers, S241125n, has been reported to be associated with a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) and X-ray afterglow emission. Such an association could potentially unveil the environments of mergers and provide attractive targets for multi-messenger observations. We summarize these observations and model it as a binary BH merger occurring within an active galactic nucleus (AGN), where the merger remnant accretes disk material at hyper-Eddington rates. The resulting jet could lead to the GRB associated with the GW event. The GRB, detected by Swift-BAT, exhibits a Comptonized spectrum with an unusually soft photon index, which is consistent with emission from the jet interacting the emission associated with the dense AGN disk environment. Its X-ray afterglow shows an unusually hard spectrum, indicating possible strong absorption by a high column density typical of AGN disks. We highlight the importance of identifying the host galaxy and conducting more sensitive infrared observations to test the model.

  We present a $z=0$ census of nuggets -- compact galaxies that form via gas-rich violent disk instability -- within the luminosity- and volume-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntext (ECO) surveys. We use random forest (RF) models to predict near-ultraviolet (NUV) magnitudes for ECO galaxies that lack high-quality NUV magnitudes, thereby doubling the number of ECO galaxies with reliable extinction-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) and red/green/blue classifications based on specific SFRs (sSFRs). The resulting RF-enhanced RESOLVE+ECO nugget sample allows us to analyze rare subpopulations -- green nuggets and nuggets with active galactic nuclei (AGN) -- likely associated with quenching. Green nuggets are more similar to red nuggets than to blue nuggets in halo mass ($M_{\text{halo}}$) distribution, with both red and green nuggets being found mainly at $M_{\text{halo}} \ge 10^{11.4} M_\odot$, where permanent halo quenching is predicted. At these masses, the AGN frequency for green nuggets is higher ($\text{48.2\%}^{+5.3\%}_{-5.3\%}$) than for either blue ($\text{39.2\%}^{+2.9\%}_{-2.8\%}$) or red ($\text{29.3\%}^{+3.0\%}_{-2.8\%}$) nuggets. Between $M_{halo} = 10^{11.4}-10^{12} M_\odot$, at the onset of permanent quenching, the AGN frequency for green nuggets is nearly double the frequency for blue or red nuggets, implying AGN are associated with this transition. At $M_{halo} &lt; 10^{11.4} M_\odot$, where temporary cyclic quenching is expected, the AGN frequency for blue nuggets ($\text{7.5\%}^{+1.4\%}_{-1.2\%}$) is lower than for either green ($\text{31.3\%}^{+8.7\%}_{-7.5\%}$) or red ($\text{18.8\%}^{+11.5\%}_{-7.8\%}$) nuggets. At all masses, nuggets with AGN have reduced sSFRs and likely also atomic gas content compared to nuggets without AGN, but the quenching is more extreme below $M_{halo} = 10^{11.4} M_\odot$.

  We present full-polarization observations at $\lambda = 0.87$ mm (345 GHz) conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward Messier 87 (M87) and seven other radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). We determine polarization and Faraday properties of the targets, with linear polarization (LP) fractions spanning 1\% to 17\%, and Faraday rotation measures (RMs) exceeding $10^{5}$ rad m$^{-2}$. These RM values, 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than typically observed at $\lambda &gt; 3$ mm, suggest denser Faraday screens or stronger magnetic fields in the (sub)millimeter emission regions. Additionally, we present the first submillimeter polarized images of the M87 jet and the observed AGN. In the M87 jet, we identify RM gradients and sign reversals, suggestive of a helical magnetic field structure extending over kiloparsec scales. These observations were part of the ALMA Band~7 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) commissioning during the April 2021 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) campaign. The results provide essential constraints for calibrating, analyzing, and interpreting VLBI data from the EHT at 345 GHz, representing a critical step toward submillimeter VLBI imaging.

  Reverberation mapping is a technique in which the mass of a Seyfert I galaxy's central supermassive black hole is estimated, along with the system's physical scale, from the timescale at which variations in brightness propagate through the galactic nucleus. This mapping allows for a long baseline of time measurements to extract spatial information beyond the angular resolution of our telescopes, and is the main means of constraining supermassive black hole masses at high redshift. The most recent generation of multi-year reverberation mapping campaigns for large numbers of active galactic nuclei (e.g. OzDES) have had to deal with persistent complications of identifying false positives, such as those arising from aliasing due to seasonal gaps in time-series data. We introduce LITMUS (Lag Inference Through the Mixed Use of Samplers), a modern lag recovery tool built on the "damped random walk" model of quasar variability, built in the autodiff framework JAX. LITMUS is purpose built to handle the multimodal aliasing of seasonal observation windows and provides evidence integrals for model comparison, a more quantified alternative to existing methods of lag validation. LITMUS also offers a flexible modular framework for extending modelling of AGN variability, and includes JAX-enabled implementations of other popular lag recovery methods like nested sampling and the interpolated cross correlation function. We test LITMUS on a number of mock light curves modelled after the OzDES sample and find that it recovers their lags with high precision and a successfully identifies spurious lag recoveries, reducing its false positive rate to drastically outperform the state of the art program JAVELIN. LITMUS's high performance is accomplished by an algorithm for mapping the Bayesian posterior density which both constrains the lag and offers a Bayesian framework for model null hypothesis testing.

  Quasars, powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs), exhibit significant variability, offering insights into the physics of accretion and the properties of the central engines. In this study, we analyze photometric variability and its correlation with key quasar properties, including black hole mass ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}$) and nuclear luminosities, using 915 quasars with $0\leq z&lt;3.0$ from the AQMES sample monitored within SDSS-V. Variability metrics were derived from approximately 6-year light curves provided by the Zwicky Transient Facility -- ZTF, while SMBH masses and luminosities were obtained from the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog of \citet{wu2022catalog}. We identify a strong anti-correlation between variability amplitude and luminosity, which strengthens with redshift, and a redshift-dependent trend for $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$: a positive correlation at low redshifts, no significant correlation at intermediate redshifts, and an anti-correlation the highest redshifts. Our main finding is a robust anti-correlation between photometric variability amplitude and Eddington ratio, consistent across redshift bins. We present a general equation encapsulating this relationship, that appears to be almost free of redshift dependence, enabling predictions of quasar variability based on accretion parameters {\bf or vice-versa}. The derived relation with the Eddington ratio provides a unified framework for interpreting variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and facilitates future studies of quasar variability using high-cadence surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time -- LSST.
