  The measured ages of massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\sim 3-4$ imply that massive galaxies quench as early as $z\sim 6$. While the number of spectroscopic confirmations of quiescent galaxies at $z &lt; 3$ has increased over the years, there are only a handful at $z &gt; 3.5$. We report spectroscopic redshifts of one secure ($z=3.757$) and two tentative ($z = 3.336$, $z=4.673$) massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) &gt; 10.3$) quiescent galaxies with 11 hours of Keck/MOSFIRE $K$-band observations. Our candidates were selected from the FENIKS survey, which uses deep Gemini/Flamingos-2 $K_b$ $K_r$ imaging optimized for increased sensitivity to the characteristic red colors of galaxies at $z &gt; 3$ with strong Balmer/4000 \AA\ breaks. The rest-frame $UVJ$ and $(ugi)_s$ colors of 3/4 quiescent candidates are consistent with $1-2$ Gyr old stellar populations. This places these galaxies as the oldest objects at these redshifts, and challenges the notion that quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 3$ are all recently-quenched, "post-starburst'' galaxies. Our spectroscopy shows that the other quiescent-galaxy candidate is a broad-line AGN ($z = 3.594$) with strong, redshifted $H\beta$+[O III] emission with a velocity offset $&gt;1000$ km/s, indicative of a powerful outflow. The star-formation history of our highest redshift candidate suggests that its progenitor was already in place by $z \sim 7-11$, reaching $\sim$ 10$^{11} M_{\odot}$ by $z \simeq 10$. These observations reveal the limit of what is possible with deep near-infrared photometry and targeted spectroscopy from the ground and demonstrate that secure spectroscopic confirmation of quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 4$ is only feasible with JWST.

  Feedback effects generated by supernovae (SNe) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are pivotal in shaping the evolution of galaxies and their present-day structures. However, our understanding of the specific mechanisms operating at galactic scales, as well as their impact on circum-galactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM), remains incomplete. Galaxy formation simulations encounter challenges in resolving sub-parsec scales, necessitating the implementation of subgrid models to capture the physics occurring at smaller scales. In this article, we provide an overview of the ongoing efforts to develop more physically grounded feedback models. We discuss the pursuit of pushing simulation resolution to its limits in galaxy simulations and the rigorous testing of galaxy formation codes through participation in the AGORA code comparison project. Additionally, we delve into techniques for investigating the impact of feedback using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, specifically through Lya absorption and CGM/IGM tomography. Furthermore, we outline our future research directions within this field and highlight the progress made by comparing our simulation results with observational data.
