  The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will dramatically increase the number of strong gravitational lensing systems, requiring precise modeling of line-of-sight (LOS) effects to mitigate biases in lensing observations and cosmological inferences. We develop a method to construct joint distributions of external convergence ($\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$) and shear ($\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$) for strong lensing LOS by aggregating large-scale structure simulations with high-resolution halo renderings and non-linear correction. Our approach captures both smooth background matter and perturbations from halos, enabling accurate modeling of LOS effects. We apply non-linear LOS corrections to $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$ that address the non-additive lensing effects caused by objects along the LOS in strong lensing. We find that, with a minimum image separation of $1.0^{\prime\prime}$, non-linear LOS correction due to the presence of a dominant deflector slightly increases the ratio of quadruple to double lenses; this non-linear LOS correction also introduces systematic biases of $\sim 0.1\%$ for galaxy-AGN lenses in the inferred Hubble constant ($H_0$) if not accounted for. We also observe a $0.66\%$ bias for galaxy-galaxy lenses on $H_0$, and even larger biases up to $1.02\%$ for galaxy-AGN systems if LOS effects are not accounted for. These results highlight the importance of LOS for precision cosmology. The publicly available code and datasets provide tools for incorporating LOS effects in future analyses.

  Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) offers a novel observational channel that complements traditional electromagnetic approaches and provides unique insights into the astrophysical environments of GW sources. In this work, we investigate the repeated lensing of continuous gravitational wave (CW) sources in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), focusing on the imprint of SMBH spin via the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect. Although typically weak and challenging to observe, the spin-induced precession of source orbits can accumulate over time, thereby modulating the lensing geometry. Such modulations influence the magnification, duration, and waveform structure of each repeated lensing event, and enhance the overall probability of lensing occurrences. Using matched filtering, we demonstrate that spin-dependent signatures may be detectable, suggesting that lensed CW signals could serve as an indirect probe of SMBH spin in AGNs.

  The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data -- particularly near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset reaching down to approximately 28th magnitude (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies, redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age, directly from photometric data out to redshift $z = 3.5$. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto two-dimensional maps, revealing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions.We first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers reliable estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics (NMAD and RMSE typically between 0.1 and 0.3) confirm the method's precision, with about 70\% of predictions falling within one standard deviation (dex) of the reference values. While redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web presents challenges (median NMAD = 0.05), the overall success of the SOM highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation.

  The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory has been serving as a survey instrument for the hard X-ray sky, and has detected thousands of X-ray sources (e.g., AGNs, X-ray binaries, etc). BAT monitors these X-ray sources and follows their light curves on time scales from minutes to years. In addition, BAT discovers hundreds of new X-ray sources in survey images stacked throughout the mission lifetime. We present the updated BAT survey catalog since the last published BAT 105 month survey catalog (Oh et al. 2018) with additional of 4.5 years of data until December 2017. Data since 2007 are reprocessed to include updated instrumental calibration. Analysis in this study shows that additional systematic noise can be seen in the 157-month mosaic images, resulting in decreases in the expected improvement in sensitivity and the number of new detections. The BAT 157-month survey reaches a sensitivity of $8.83 \times 10^{-12} \rm \ erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2}$ for 90\% of the sky and $6.44 \times 10^{-12} \rm \ erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2}$ for 10\% of the sky. This catalog includes spectra, monthly and snapshot light curves in eight energy bands (14-20, 20-24, 24-35, 35-50, 50-75, 75-100, 100-150, and 150-195 keV) for 1888 sources, including 256 new detections above the detection threshold of $4.8\sigma$. The light curves, spectra, and tables that summarize the information of the detected-sources are available in the online journal and in the catalog web page https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/bs157mon/.

  Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range $z$ $\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the $\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.

  We report the discovery of a relativistic jet in Mrk~110, a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy historically classified as a radio-quiet active galactic nucleus (AGN). Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations reveal intermittent jet activity during 2015--2016 and 2022--2024, with proper motion measurements yielding superluminal velocities of $\sim3.6\pm0.6\,c$ and $\sim2.1\pm0.2\,c$, respectively. The recent jet component decelerates to $\sim 1.5\pm0.2\,c$ at a projected distance of 1.1 parsec from the core, coinciding with the transition zone between broad-line and narrow-line regions. This deceleration accompanies dramatic spectral evolution from steep (the spectral index $\alpha \approx -0.63 \pm 0.04$) to inverted ($\alpha \approx +0.69 \pm 0.10$) as the 7.6 GHz flux density more than doubled. These episodic jet ejections and their evolutionary pattern match theoretical predictions from magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models for temporary jet formation in systems with Mrk 110's physical parameters on timescales of months to years. The observed jet deceleration distance matches expectations for relativistic outflows interacting with the circumnuclear environment. These findings demonstrate that the traditional radio-loud/quiet AGN dichotomy may reflect time-averaged states rather than intrinsic capabilities, suggesting that jets may form across the AGN population but become observable only during specific accretion phases when MAD conditions are temporarily established. Mrk 110 serves as a critical "missing link" between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN, providing insight into jet formation mechanisms, environmental interactions, and physical processes that unify various AGN classifications.

  Relativistic jets from AGN are an important driver of feedback in galaxies. They interact with their environments over a wide range of physical scales during their lifetime, and an understanding of these interactions is crucial for unraveling the role of supermassive blackholes in shaping galaxy evolution. The impact of such jets have been traditionally considered in the context of heating the large-scale environments. However, in the last few decades there has been additional focus on the immediate impact of jet feedback on the host galaxy itself. In this review we outline the development of various numerical simulations since the onset of studies of jets to the present day, where sophisticated numerical techniques have been employed to study jet feedback including a range of physical processes. The jets can act as an important agent of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well as its star formation. We summarize the recent results from simulations of jet feedback on kpc scales, and outline the broader implications for observations and galaxy evolution.

  We present in this proceeding the results of the test phase of the GRAVITY+ adaptive optics. This extreme AO will enable both high-dynamic range observations of faint companions (including exoplanets) thanks to a 40x40 sub-apertures wavefront control, and sensitive observations (including AGNs) thanks to the addition of a laser guide star to each UT of the VLT. This leap forward is made thanks to a mostly automated setup of the AO, including calibration of the NCPAs, that we tested in Europe on the UT+atmosphere simulator we built in Nice. We managed to reproduce in laboratory the expected performances of all the modes of the AO, including under non-optimal atmospheric or telescope alignment conditions, giving us the green light to proceed with the Assembly, Integration and Verification phase in Paranal.

  Significant variability in broad emission line strengths of active galactic nuclei (AGN) over months to years has been observed, often accompanied by intrinsic continuum changes. Such spectral variability challenges the traditional AGN classification scheme, which attributes differences between Type 1 and Type 2 to geometrical effects, as transitions between these types occur on timescales shorter than viscous ones. In this work, using the {\sc cloudy} photo-ionization simulations, we investigated the response of the major emission line fluxes, in the optical/UV and hard X-ray bands, to changes in the intensity and shape of the continuum emission of the AGN under two scenarios: (i) changes in the X-ray power-law while keeping disc emission fixed, and (ii) broadband continuum variations. We demonstrate that BLR line fluxes are insensitive to X-ray power-law changes alone. Considering a well-studied case of the changing-look (CL) AGN Mrk 1018, which exhibits variations in the intrinsic disc emission, as well as the X-ray power-law, our simulations reproduce observed brightening and dimming trends of the BLR emission. Moreover, we show that the highly ionized Fe K$\alpha$ X-ray flux, primarily produced by the H-like and He-like ions of Fe, strongly depends on the X-ray strength of the intrinsic SED. These findings suggest that the origin of highly ionized Fe K$\alpha$ emission is in the coronal part of the accretion disk and that the CL phenomenon can be triggered by intrinsic changes in the accretion properties of AGN.

  We present a new 8.5 ks Chandra observation of Abell 1885, obtained as part of the Cluster Evolution Reference Ensemble At Low-z (CEREAL) survey of ~200 low-z galaxy groups and clusters. These data reveal that Abell 1885 is a strong cool core, with a central cooling time of 0.43 Gyr, and that the central galaxy hosts an X-ray luminous point source at its center (L=2.3x10^42 erg/s), indicative of a rapidly accreting supermassive black hole. In the context of the larger CEREAL sample, we constrain the fraction of clusters at z~0.15 with X-ray bright central AGN to be no more than 4.1%. Including radio data from LOFAR, GMRT, ASKAP, and the VLA and optical integral field unit data from SDSS MaNGA, we probe the details of cooling, feeding, and feedback in this system. These data reveal that cooling of the intracluster medium is highly suppressed on large (&gt;10 kpc) scales despite a central supermassive black hole that is in the early stages of the self-regulation cycle (characterized by rapid accretion, physically small jets, and no large-scale low-frequency radio emission). To reconcile the large-scale quenching with a lack of visible large-scale feedback, we propose that the timescale on which energy is dissipated on large scales is significantly longer than the timescale on which black hole feeding operates on small (~pc) scales. These observations suggest that there are two separate timescales characterizing AGN feedback in clusters: the short timescale of small-scale feeding and feedback processes and a longer timescale by which energy is dissipated on large physical scales in the intracluster medium. This interpretation disfavors a model in which the energy is rapidly dissipated (e.g. shocks), which would synchronize the feeding and feedback timescales, and favors a model in which the heating effects of AGN feedback can linger long after the outburst has passed (e.g. turbulent mixing).

  We present AGNBoost, a machine learning framework utilizing XGBoostLSS to identify AGN and estimate redshifts from JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry. AGNBoost constructs 121 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands-including magnitudes, colors, and squared color terms-to simultaneously predict the fraction of mid-IR $3-30\,\mu$m emission attributable to an AGN power law (frac$_\text{AGN}$) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on a sample of $10^6$ simulated galaxies from CIGALE providing ground truth values of both frac$_\text{AGN}$ and redshift. Models are tested against both mock CIGALE galaxies set aside for testing and 698 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On mock galaxies, AGNBoost achieves $15\%$ outlier fractions of $0.19\%$ (frac$_\text{AGN}$) and $0.63\%$ (redshift), with a root mean square error ($\sigma_\text{RMSE}$) of $0.027$ for frac$_\text{AGN}$ and a normalized mean absolute deviation ($\sigma_\text{NMAD}$) of 0.011 for redshift. On MEGA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves $\sigma_\text{NMAD}$ = 0.074 and $17.05\%$ outliers, with most outliers at $z_\text{spec} &gt; 2$. AGNBoost frac$_\text{AGN}$ estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting ($\sigma_\text{RMSE} = 0.183$, $20.41\%$ outliers), and AGNBoost finds a similar number of AGNs as CIGALE SED fitting. The flexible framework of AGNBoost allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands and derived qualities, and simple re-training for other variables of interest. AGNBoost's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for wide-sky surveys requiring rapid AGN identification and redshift estimation.

  Changing-look AGNs (CLAGN) are accreting supermassive black hole systems that undergo variations in optical spectral type, driven by major changes in accretion rate. Mrk 1018 has undergone two transitions, a brightening event in the 1980s and a transition back to a faint state over the course of 2-3 years in the early 2010s. We characterize the evolving physical properties of the source's inner accretion flow, particularly during the bright-to-faint transition, as well as the morphological properties of its parsec-scale circumnuclear gas. We model archival X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton, Chandra, Suzaku, and Swift, using physically-motivated models to characterize X-ray spectral variations and track Fe Kalpha line flux. We also quantify Mrk 1018's long-term multi-wavelength spectral variability from optical/UV to the X-rays. Over the duration of the bright-to-faint transition, the UV and hard X-ray flux fell by differing factors, roughly 24 and 8, respectively. The soft X-ray excess faded, and was not detected by 2021. In the faint state, when the Eddington ratio drops to log Lbol/LEdd &lt; -1.7, the hot X-ray corona photon index shows a 'softer-when-fainter' trend, similar to that seen in some black hole X-ray binaries and samples of low-luminosity AGNs. Finally, the Fe Kalpha line flux has dropped by only half the factor of the drop in the X-ray continuum. The transition from the bright state to the faint state is consistent with the inner accretion flow transitioning from a geometrically-thin disk to an ADAF-dominated state, with the warm corona disintegrating or becoming energetically negligible, while the X-ray-emitting hot flow becoming energetically dominant. Meanwhile, narrow Fe Kalpha emission has not yet fully responded to the drop in its driving continuum, likely because its emitter extends up to roughly 10 pc.

  Hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs) are of interest because of their potential to act as dark matter or to reveal information about yet undiscovered fundamental constituents of matter. Such particles can be created when photons traverse regions of magnetic fields. The conversion probability depends on both the magnetic field parameters and photon energy, leading to multiple spectral absorption features as light passes through magnetized regions.   Traditionally, astrophysical searches have focused on detecting such features in individual objects. However, the limited understanding of properties of cosmic magnetic fields have hindered the progress. Here we introduce a new approach by analyzing stacked (rather than individual) spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) positioned behind galaxy clusters -- gigantic magnetic field reservoirs. Stacking efficiently averages over the uncertainties in magnetic fields, revealing a unique step-like spectral signature of photon-to-ALP conversion.   With this approach we advance into previously inaccessible regions of the ALP parameter space for nano-electronvolt masses. Adopting this method will significantly improve existing bounds across a wide range of masses by using different telescopes and increasing the size of the stacked datasets. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, in particular, will extensively probe the parameter space where ALPs could serve as dark matter.

  The majority of gravitational wave events detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaboration originate from binary black hole (BBH) mergers, for which no confirmed electromagnetic counterparts have been identified to date. However, if such mergers occur within the disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), they may generate observable optical flares induced by relativistic jet activity and shock-heated gas. We present results from a long-term optical follow-up of the gravitational wave event S231206cc, conducted with the T80-South telescope as part of the S-PLUS Transient Extension Program (STEP). Our search prioritized AGN-hosted environments by crossmatching the gravitational wave localization with known AGN catalogs. No candidate met the criteria for a viable optical counterpart. We explored three BBH merger scenarios predicting optical emission in AGN disks: (i) ram pressure stripping, (ii) long-term emission from an emerging jet cocoon, and (iii) jet breakout followed by shock cooling. Using our observational cadence and depth, we constrained the BBH parameter space, including the remnant's location within the AGN disk, kick velocity, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. Detectable flares are most likely when mergers occur at 0.01-0.1 parsecs from SMBHs with masses between 10^7 and 10^8 solar masses, where short delay times and long durations best align with our follow-up strategy. These results provide a framework for identifying AGN-hosted BBH counterparts and guiding future multimessenger efforts.

  We investigate how AGN disk turbulence affects the orbital dynamics of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) initially located at a migration trap, focusing on the long-term behavior of eccentricity and inclination in the quasi-embedded regime. We develop a semi-analytical framework in which turbulence is modeled as a stochastic velocity field acting through a modified drag force. We integrate the resulting stochastic differential equations both in Cartesian coordinates and in orbital elements using a linearized perturbative approach, and compare these results with full numerical simulations. Eccentricity and inclination evolve toward steady-state Rayleigh distributions, with variances determined by the local disk properties and the ratio of the gas damping rate to the orbital frequency. The analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations. We provide closed-form expressions for the variances in both the fast and slow damping regimes. These results are directly applicable to Monte Carlo population models and can serve as physically motivated initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations. Turbulent forcing prevents full circularization and alignment of BH orbits in AGN disks, even in the presence of strong gas drag. This has important implications for BH merger and binary formation rates, which are sensitive to the residual eccentricity and inclination. Our results highlight the need to account for turbulence-induced stochastic heating when modeling the dynamical evolution of compact objects in AGN environments.

  The local X-ray AGN population appears to follow a growth cycle regulated by the AGN's own radiation, marked by changes in their obscuration and Eddington ratio during accretion events. Because AGN in infrared-selected galaxies are more likely to be Compton-thick and have evidence for over-massive black holes, we explore whether infrared-selected AGN follow the radiation-regulated AGN growth scheme. We calculate the Eddington ratios of nine U/LIRG AGN with dynamical BH mass measurements, finding that though the number of objects is limited, AGN in IR-selected galaxies appear consistent with radiation pressure-regulated growth. We suggest that enlarging the sample of dynamical BH mass measurements in IR-selected systems will provide more stringent tests of whether their AGN are primarily regulated by radiation pressure.

  Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a rare population of hyperluminous dust-obscured quasars discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) all-sky survey. The heavy circumnuclear dust obscuration allows only a small amount of scattered light from the obscured quasar to escape, enabling the decomposition of the stellar component from the total flux. The presence of scattered light enables the redshift of the source and the properties of the black hole to be obtained from SDSS and SDSS-related literature. From WISE and SDSS data, we select 11 hyperluminous Hot DOGs at $z=1.5-3.7$ with bolometric luminosities $L_{\rm bol} \gtrsim 10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg \ s^{-1}}$. We investigate the $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ relation in these sources using Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting or with extra constraints from \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) image decomposition. Stellar masses are successfully derived for eight Hot DOGs. We find high Eddington ratios $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in these Hot DOGs, with the median value of 1.05 and the maximum value close to 3. The super-Eddington accretion may be associated with the overdense environments of Hot DOGs. We find no significant differences in the $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ of these Hot DOGs compared to the local relation, suggesting that these dust-obscured quasars are the progenitors of massive early-type galaxies. We speculate that the subsequent evolution of Hot DOGs may be significantly influenced by AGN feedback and remain on the local relation.

  Galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibit broad emission lines as a key spectral feature. The shape of emission-line profiles depends on the complex dynamics of discrete clouds within a spatially extended region known as the Broad Line Region (BLR). The distribution of cloud positions within BLR, or the geometry of BLR indeed, is directly linked to measurements of time lags of BLR. In this paper, we convolve a large grid of physically-based simulations of cloud distributions in BLR with photon-flux weighted emissivity of BLR clouds to investigate the generic shape of spectral line profiles. More importantly, we extract the time-delay histograms of corresponding models to calculate the size of BLR. Our physical model is based on the assumption that the clouds are launched by the radiation pressure acting on dust in the atmosphere of the outer disk. It has very few global parameters. The model is appropriate for the low ionization part of the BLR, as it was shown by earlier model tests. It uses a non-hydrodynamical single-cloud approach to the BLR dynamics. In this way we simulate the distribution of positions and velocities of the clouds. We found that the width of line profiles gets broader with black hole mass, or with viewing angle, and gets narrower with accretion rate. The blue wing of the emission line profiles becomes more pronounced with increasing black hole mass and accretion rate, consistent with the formation and intensification of an outflow structure. We also found that the peak time-delays rather than averaged delay values better represents the observational trend and also the scatter in the radius-luminosity relation.
