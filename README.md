  Markarian 817 is a bright and variable Seyfert-1.2 active galactic nucleus (AGN). X-ray monitoring of Mrk 817 with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in 2022 revealed that the source flux had declined to a lower level than recorded at any prior point in the then-19-year mission. We present an analysis of deep XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations obtained in this low flux state. The spectra reveal a complex X-ray wind consisting of neutral and ionized absorption zones. Three separate velocity components are detected as part of a structured ultra-fast outflow (UFO), with v/c = 0.043 (+0.007,-0.003), v/c = 0.079 (+0.003,-0.0008), and v/c = 0.074 (+0.004,-0.005). These projected velocities suggest that the wind likely arises at radii that are much smaller than the optical broad line region (BLR). In order for each component of the outflow to contribute significant feedback, the volume filling factors must be greater than f ~ 0.009, f ~ 0.003, and f ~ 0.3, respectively. For plausible, data-driven volume filling factors, these limits are passed, and the total outflow likely delivers the fierce feedback required to reshape its host environment, despite a modest radiative Eddington fraction of lambda ~ 0.008-0.016 (this range reflects plausible masses). UFOs are often detected at or above the Eddington limit; this result signals that black hole accretion has the potential to shape host galaxies even at modest Eddington fractions, and over a larger fraction of a typical AGN lifetime. We discuss our findings in terms of models for disk winds and black hole feedback in this and other AGN.

  A new class of radio source, the so-called Odd Radio Circles (ORCs), have been discovered by recent sensitive, large-area radio continuum surveys. The distances of these sources have so far relied on photometric redshifts of optical galaxies found at the centers of or near the ORCs. Here we present Gemini rest-frame optical spectroscopy of six galaxies at the centers of, or potentially associated with, the first five ORC discoveries. We supplement this with Legacy Survey imaging and Prospector fits to their griz+W1/W2 photometry. Of the three ORCs with central galaxies, all lie at distances (z = 0.27-0.55) that confirm the large intrinsic diameters of the radio circles (300-500 kpc). The central galaxies are massive ($M_*\sim10^{11}M_\odot$), red, unobscured ellipticals with old ($\gtrsim$1~Gyr) stellar populations. They have LINER spectral types that are shock- or AGN-powered. All three host low-luminosity, radio-quiet AGN. The similarity of their central galaxies are consistent with a common origin, perhaps as a blastwave from an ancient starburst. The other two ORCs are adjacent and have no prominent central galaxies. However, the z=0.25 disk galaxy that lies between them hosts a Type 2, moderate-luminosity AGN. They may instead be the lobes of a radio jet from this AGN.

  Disc winds are a common feature in accreting astrophysical systems on all scales. In active galactic nuclei (AGN) and accreting white dwarfs (AWDs), specifically, radiation pressure mediated by spectral lines is a promising mechanism for driving these outflows. Previous hydrodynamical simulations have largely supported this idea, but relied on highly approximate treatments of ionization and radiative transfer. Given the sensitivity of line driving to the ionization state and radiation field in the outflow, here we present a new method for carrying out 2.5D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that takes full account of the frequency-dependent radiative transfer through the wind, the corresponding ionization state and the resulting radiative accelerations. Applying our method to AWDs, we find that it is much harder to drive a powerful line-driven outflow when the interaction between matter and radiation is treated self-consistently. This conclusion is robust to changes in the adopted system parameters. The fundamental difficulty is that discs luminous enough to drive such a wind are also hot enough to over-ionize it. As a result, the mass-loss rates in our simulations are much lower than those found in earlier, more approximate calculations. We also show that the ultraviolet spectra produced by our simulations do not match those observed in AWDs. We conclude that, unless the over-ionization problem can be mitigated (e.g. by sub-grid clumping or a softer-than-expected radiation field), line driving may not be a promising mechanism for powering the outflows from AWDs. These conclusions are likely to have significant implications for disc winds in AGN also.

  We present the discovery of a very extended (550 kpc) and low-surface-brightness ($ 3.3 \mu \mathrm{Jy} \, arcsec^{-2} $ at 144 MHz) radio emission region in Abell 1318. These properties are consistent with its characterisation as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) remnant radio plasma, based on its morphology and radio spectral properties. We performed a broad-band (54 - 1400 MHz) radio spectral index and curvature analysis using LOFAR, uGMRT, and WSRT-APERTIF data. We also derived the radiative age of the detected emission, estimating a maximum age of 250 Myr. The morphology of the source is remarkably intriguing, with two larger, oval-shaped components and a thinner, elongated, and filamentary structure in between, plausibly reminiscent of two aged lobes and a jet. Based on archival {\it Swift} as well as SDSS data we performed an X-ray and optical characterisation of the system, whose virial mass was estimated to be $ \sim 7.4 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{M} _{\odot}$. This places A1318 in the galaxy group regime. Interestingly, the radio source does not have a clear optical counterpart embedded in it, thus, we propose that it is most likely an unusual AGN remnant of previous episode(s) of activity of the AGN hosted by the brightest group galaxy ($ \sim 2.6 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{M} _{\odot}$), which is located at a projected distance of $\sim$170 kpc in the current epoch. This relatively high offset may be a result of IGrM sloshing sourced by a minor merger. The filamentary morphology of the source may suggest that the remnant plasma has been perturbed by the system dynamics, however, only future deeper X-ray observations will be able to address this question.

  Hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs) are the most extreme star-forming systems observed in the early Universe, and their properties still elude comprehensive understanding. We have undertaken a large XMM-Newton observing program to probe the total accreting black hole population in three HyLIRGs at z = 2.12, 3.25, and 3.55, gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. Selected from the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES), these HyLIRGs have apparent infrared luminosities &gt; E14 Lsun. Our observations revealed X-ray emission in each of them. PJ1336+49 appears to be dominated by high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). Remarkably, the luminosity of this non-AGN X-ray emission exceeds by a factor of about three the value obtained by calibration with local galaxies with much lower star formation rates. This enhanced X-ray emission most likely highlights the efficacy of dynamical HMXB production within compact clusters, which is an important mode of star formation in HyLIRGs. The remaining two (PJ0116-24 and PJ1053+60) morphologically and spectrally exhibit a compact X-ray component in addition to the extended non-AGN X-ray emission, indicating the presence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The AGN appears to be centrally located in the reconstructed source plane images of PJ0116-24, which manifests its star-forming activity predominantly within an extended galactic disk. In contrast, the AGN in the field of PJ1053+60 is projected 60 kpc away from the extreme star-forming galaxy and could be ejected from it. These results underline the synergistic potential of deep X-ray observations with strong lensing for the study of high-energy astrophysical phenomena in HyLIRGs.

  In the last decades, an increasing scientific interest has been growing in the elusive population of "dark" (i.e. lacking an optical/NIR counterpart) Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies (DSFGs). Although extremely promising for their likely contribution to the cosmic Star Formation Rate Density and for their possible role in the evolution of the first massive and passive galaxies around $z\sim3$, the difficulty in selecting statistically significant samples of dark DSFGs is limiting their scientific potentialities. This work presents the first panchromatic study of a sample of 263 Radio-Selected NIRdark galaxies discovered in the COSMOS field following the procedure by Talia+21. These sources are selected as radio-bright galaxies (S(3GHz)&gt;12.65 uJy) with no counterpart in the NIR-selected COSMOS2020 catalog (Ks &gt; 25.5 mag). For these sources, we build a new photometric catalog including accurate photometry from the optical to the radio obtained with a new deblending pipeline (PhoEBO: Photometry Extractor for Blended Objects). We employ this catalog to estimate the photo-zs and the physical properties of the galaxies through an SED-fitting procedure performed with two different codes (Magphys and Cigale). Finally, we estimate the AGN contamination in our sample by performing a series of complementary tests. The high values of the median extinction (Av ~ 4) and star formation rate (SFR ~ 500 Msun/yr) confirm the likely DSFG nature of the RS-NIRdark galaxies. The median photo-z (z~3) and the presence of a significant tail of high-z candidates (z&gt;4.5) suggest that these sources are important contributors to the cosmic SFRD and the evolutionary path of galaxies at high redshifts.
