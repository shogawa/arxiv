We present near- and mid-infrared spectra of eight Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN), spanning nearly four orders of magnitude in black hole mass and Eddington ratio, obtained with JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI as part of the ReveaLLAGN program along with identical archival data of Cen A. The high spatial resolution of JWST cleanly separates AGN emission from host-galaxy contamination, enabling detections of high-ionization potential lines more than an order of magnitude fainter than previously measured. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a transition at log($L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$) ~ -3.5, where the spectral energy distribution becomes increasingly deficient in ultraviolet photons. We find that rotational H$_2$ excitation temperatures are elevated (~500 K higher) compared to both higher-luminosity AGN and star-forming galaxies, while the H$_2$(0-0)S(3)/PAH$_{11.3 μm}$ ratios are consistent with those observed in the AGN population. We discuss the possible roles of outflows, jets, and X-ray dominated regions in shaping the interstellar medium surrounding LLAGN. Silicate emission at ~10 $μ$m, localized to the nuclear region, is detected in most ReveaLLAGN targets. This dataset offers the first comprehensive JWST-based characterization of infrared emission lines in the nuclear regions of LLAGN.

As the central galaxy in the nearest cluster, M87 provides the best spatial resolution for disentangling the complex interactions between AGN jets and the surrounding environment. We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$α$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback.

From James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) surveys, 31 galaxies with average redshift 7.3 are selected containing large Balmer break, Lyman-$α$ break (V-shaped SED versus $λ$). Apart from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST-NIRCam (Near-infrared camera) photometry for these galaxies, there are JWST-NIRSpec (Near-infrared spectrograph) spectra for 13 galaxies and mid-infrared photometry (mostly JWST-MIRI) for 15 of them. Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 angstroms breaks or CaII lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to HII regions, AGN, interstellar dust extinction and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: $0.61\pm 0.31$(95% CL) Gyr, while the average age of the $Λ$CDM universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch $z_{ form.}&gt;11.2$(97.5% CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within $&gt;4.7σ$. TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension. None the less, there may be other uncertainties in the models, so this tension is a provisional result and further research is needed to confirm it.

We present results from XMM-Newton observations of ten high-redshift ($0.81 &lt; z &lt; 1.17$) galaxy clusters selected from the CAMIRA catalog based on high richness ($N &gt; 40$). These massive clusters, identified in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program field, provide an ideal sample for probing the dynamical state of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the early Universe. We performed uniform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses to measure the ICM temperature and bolometric luminosity, and investigated cluster morphology through offsets between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the X-ray peak. Extended X-ray emission was detected from all targets, but only one system was classified as dynamically relaxed, indicating a low relaxed fraction ($\sim 10\%$) at high redshift. By combining this high-$z$ sample with a lower-redshift CAMIRA cluster sample, we derived scaling relations among richness, temperature, luminosity, and mass. The results are broadly consistent with predictions from both the self-similar model and the baseline model incorporating the mass--concentration relation. We find no significant redshift evolution, strengthening the view that cluster scaling relations are largely established by $z \sim 1$. We also examined the AGN fraction among member galaxies and found significantly higher AGN activity in high-redshift clusters, particularly in the outskirts, suggesting enhanced AGN triggering during early cluster assembly and a possible connection to the thermodynamic state of dynamically young clusters. These findings provide new insights into the formation and evolution of massive clusters and the thermodynamic history of the ICM, and complement large-area X-ray surveys such as eROSITA.

Giant radio haloes are diffuse synchrotron sources typically found in merging galaxy clusters, while smaller mini-haloes occur in cool-core clusters. Both trace cosmic-ray electrons in the intracluster medium, though recent observations suggest their distinction is not always clear. We present new 903-1655 MHz MeerKAT observations of Abell 1775 and Abell 1795, both hosting cool cores and cold fronts. Combined with reprocessed 120-168 MHz LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey data, we perform imaging and spectral analyses of their radio emission. In both clusters, we detect radio haloes with distinct inner and outer components. In Abell 1775, the halo appears diffuse at 1.3 GHz, while LOFAR images reveal steep-spectrum filaments. In Abell 1795, the inner component corresponds to a previously reported mini-halo candidate, but the full structure extends to $\sim$1 Mpc with a spectral index of $α=-1.08\pm0.06$. The presence of such a large, flat-spectrum halo in a dynamically relaxed cluster makes Abell 1795 an outlier relative to typical merging systems. This suggests that some relaxed clusters may still retain sufficient turbulence to sustain particle re-acceleration, or that hadronic interactions producing secondary electrons play a significant role. Together with other recent discoveries in cool-core systems, our results indicate that some large radio haloes may have been overlooked in past studies due to limited dynamic range near bright central AGN. Finally, we detect steep-spectrum emission south of Abell 1795's central AGN, tracing a 45 kpc X-ray and optical filament that terminates in an X-ray cavity, likely linked to a past AGN outburst.
