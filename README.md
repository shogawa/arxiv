  We present multi-frequency and high-resolution studies of a sample of 24 radio transients sources discovered by comparing the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) surveys. All of them are characterized by a significant increase in radio flux density over the last two decades.Their convex spectra, small sizes and high brightness temperatures are typical for young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources and indicative of an AGN buried in the host galaxy. On the other hand, they are much weaker than the archetypical GPS objects and their parsec-scale radio structures, although indicating the presence of young radio jets, are similar to radio-quiet AGNs like Seyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxies. Based on the distribution of these objects in power$-$size ($P - D$) and peak frequency$-$size ($\nu_p - D$) diagrams, we suggest that after stabilizing their radio activity, some of the GHz-peaked radio transients (galaxies and quasars) will develop into radio-intermediate and radio-quiet (RI/RQ) quasars and low-frequency peaked-spectrum (PS) objects. We discuss several possible origins for the transient radio emission in our sources and conclude that changes in the accretion rate combined with low-power radio ejecta are the most probable cause. This is the scenario we also propose for one of our sources, 101841$-$13, which was independently identified as a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) based on its infrared variability. However, we cannot exclude that 101841$-$13 or other sources in our sample are TDEs.

  Over the past decades, there has been significant progress in our understanding of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that drive active galactic nuclei (AGNs), both from observational and theoretical perspectives. As an iconic target for this area of study, the nearby giant elliptical galaxy M87 has received special attention thanks to its proximity, large mass of the central black hole and bright emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to very-high-energy gamma rays. In particular, recent global millimeter-very-long-baseline-interferometer observations towards this nucleus have provided the first-ever opportunity to image the event-horizon-scale structure of an AGN, opening a new era of black hole astrophysics. On large scales, M87 exhibits a spectacular jet propagating far beyond the host galaxy, maintaining its narrowly collimated shape over seven orders of magnitude in distance. Elucidating the generation and propagation, as well as the internal structure, of powerful relativistic jets remains a longstanding challenge in radio-loud AGNs. M87 offers a privileged opportunity to examine such a jet with unprecedented detail. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the observational knowledge accumulated about the M87 black hole across various wavelengths. We cover both accretion and ejection processes at spatial scales ranging from outside the Bondi radius down to the event horizon. By compiling these observations and relevant theoretical studies, we aim to highlight our current understanding of accretion and jet physics for this specific object.

  We measure the spectral properties of a sample of 20 galaxies at z~0.35 selected for having surprisingly red JWST/NIRCAM F200W-F444W colors. 19 galaxies were observed with JWST/NIRSpec in the PRISM configuration, while one galaxy was observed with the high resolution gratings. 17/20 galaxies in our sample exhibit strong 3.3 $\mu m$ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH$_{3.3}$) emission (equivalent width EW(PAH$_{3.3}$)$&gt;0.03\mu m$). In these galaxies, the strength of the color excess does not depend on environment and it correlates with EW(PAH$_{3.3}$). Nonetheless, the presence of the PAH$_{3.3}$ alone can not fully explain the color excess, as an equivalent width of ~0.1$\mu m$ is able to increase the color of galaxies by only 0.13 mag. A contribution from a hot dust component is required to explain the excess. Both the EW(PAH$_{3.3}$) and flux correlate with the H$\alpha$ equivalent width and flux, suggesting that they are produced by the same mechanism. 5/20 galaxies showing PAH would be classified as passive based on broad band rest frame colors ((B-V) and/or UVJ diagrams) and are hence "faux-passive". Of these, 3 galaxies have a significantly lower EW(PAH$_{3.3}$) given their color and also have low EW(H$\alpha$) and we tentatively conclude this behaviour is due to the presence of an AGN. The three galaxies with no PAH$_{3.3}$ in emission have passive spectra, as do the 8 galaxies in our sample with normal F200W-F444W colors. We therefore conclude that the PAH$_{3.3}$ feature is linked to dust-enshrouded star formation. The dust corrected SFR from PAH$_{3.3}$ is a factor of 3.5 higher than the SFR obtained from H$\alpha$, suggesting that these galaxies are characterized by significant amounts of dust.

  The presence, distribution and kinematics of atomic neutral hydrogen in the central regions of galaxies can be traced by the HI 21~cm line observed in absorption. Depending only on the strength of the radio continuum, the associated absorption can trace the gas down to pc scale, which is ideal for exploring the HI in the nuclear regions of radio AGN. This paper gives a brief overview of the main recent findings with particular focus on the AGN-driven HI outflows. Absorption has made possible the discovery of fast and massive HI outflows and their clumpy structure on pc scales. The similarities with the predictions of numerical simulations confirm the impact of young radio jets in the feedback cycle and galaxy evolution. The field of HI absorption is rapidly expanding thanks to new ``blind" surveys and the increased spectral capabilities of the radio telescopes. This opens many possibilities for future discoveries and complements the studies of HI emission.

  Bending waves are perhaps the most fundamental and analytically tractable phenomena in warped disc dynamics. In this work we conduct 3D grid-based, numerical experiments of bending waves in laminar, viscous hydrodynamic and turbulent, weakly magnetised discs, capturing their behaviour in unprecedented detail. We clearly elucidate the theory from first principles, wherein the general Fourier-Hermite formalism can be simplified to a reduced framework which extends previous results towards locally isothermal discs. We obtain remarkable agreement with our laminar simulations wherein the tilt evolution is well described by the reduced theory, whilst higher order vertical modes should be retained for capturing the detailed disc twisting and internal velocity profiles. We then relax this laminar assumption and instead launch bending waves atop a magnetorotationally turbulent disc. Although the turbulence can be quantified with an effective $\alpha$ parameter, the bending waves behave distinctly from a classical viscous evolution and are readily disrupted when the turbulent velocity is comparable to the induced warping flows. This may have implications for the inclination damping rates induced by planet-disc interactions, the capture rate of black holes in AGN discs or the warped shapes assumed by discs in misaligned systems.

  Context: The study of quasar outflows is essential in understanding the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. We analyze the VLT/UVES spectrum of quasar SDSS J0932+0840 and identify several narrow and broad outflow components in absorption, with multiple ionization species including Fe II, which puts it among a rare class of outflows known as FeLoBALs. Aims: We study one of the outflow components to determine its physical characteristics by determining the total hydrogen column density, ionization parameter and the hydrogen number density. Through these parameters, we aim to obtain the distance of the outflow from the central source, its mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity, and to constrain the contribution of the outflow to AGN feedback. Methods: We obtain the ionic column densities from the absorption troughs in the spectrum, and use photoionization modeling to extract the physical parameters of the outflow, including the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter. The relative population of the observed excited states of Fe II is used to model the hydrogen number density of the outflow. Results: We use the Fe II excited states to model the electron number density ($n_e$) and hydrogen number density ($n_H$) independently and obtain $n_e$ $\simeq$ $10^{3.4}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $n_H$ $\simeq$ $10^{4.8}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our analysis of the physical structure of the cloud shows that these two results are consistent with each other. This places the outflow system at a distance of $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$ kpc from the central source, with mass flow rate ($\dot{M}$) of $43^{+65}_{-26}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic luminosity ($\dot{E_k}$) of $0.7^{+1.1}_{-0.4}$ $\times$ $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
