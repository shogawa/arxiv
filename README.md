  We present the first unsupervised classification of spaxels in hyperspectral images of individual galaxies. Classes identify regions by spectral similarity and thus take all the information into account that is contained in the data cubes (spatial and spectral).We used Gaussian mixture models in a latent discriminant subspace to find clusters of spaxels. The spectra were corrected for small-scale motions within the galaxy based on emission lines with an automatic algorithm. Our data consist of two MUSE/VLT data cubes of JKB 18 and NGC 1068 and one NIRSpec/JWST data cube of NGC 4151.Our classes identify many regions that are most often easily interpreted. Most of the 11 classes that we find for JKB 18 are identified as photoionised by stars. Some of them are known HII regions, but we mapped them as extended, with gradients of ionisation intensities. One compact structure has not been reported before, and according to diagnostic diagrams, it might be a planetary nebula or a denser HII region. For NGC 1068, our 16 classes are of active galactic nucleus-type (AGN) or star-forming regions. Their spatial distribution corresponds perfectly to well-known structures such as spiral arms and a ring with giant molecular clouds. A subclassification in the nuclear region reveals several structures and gradients in the AGN spectra. Our unsupervised classification of the MUSE data of NGC 1068 helps visualise the complex interaction of the AGN and the jet with the interstellar medium in a single map. The centre of NGC 4151 is very complex, but our classes can easily be related to ionisation cones, the jet, or H2 emission. We find a new elongated structure that is ionised by the AGN along the N-S axis perpendicular to the jet direction. It is rotated counterclockwise with respect to the axis of the H2 emission. Our work shows that the unsupervised classification of spaxels takes full advantage of the richness of the information in the data cubes by presenting the spectral and spatial information in a combined and synthetic way.

  We use particle-in-cell, fully electromagnetic, plasma kinetic simulation to study the effect of external magnetic field on electron scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (ESKHI). The results are applicable to collisionless plasmas when e.g. solar wind interacts with planetary magnetospheres or magnetic field is generated in AGN jets. We find that as in the case of magnetohydrodynamic KHI, in the kinetic regime, presence of external magnetic field reduces growth rate of the instability. In MHD case there is known threshold magnetic field for KHI stabilization, while in for ESKHI this is to be analytically determined. Without a kinetic analytical expression, we use several numerical simulation runs to establish an empirical dependence of ESKHI growth rate, $\Gamma(B_0)\omega_{\rm pe}$, on the strength of applied external magnetic field. We find the best fit is hyperbolic, $\Gamma(B_0)\omega_{\rm pe}=\Gamma_0\omega_{\rm pe}/(A+B\bar B_0)$, where $\Gamma_0$ is the ESKHI growth rate without external magnetic field and $\bar B_0=B_0/B_{\rm MHD}$ is the ratio of external and two-fluid MHD stability threshold magnetic field, derived here. An analytical theory to back up this growth rate dependence on external magnetic field is needed. The results suggest that in astrophysical settings where strong magnetic field pre-exists, the generation of an additional magnetic field by the ESKHI is suppressed, which implies that the Nature provides a "safety valve" -- natural protection not to "over-generate" magnetic field by ESKHI mechanism. Remarkably, we find that our two-fluid MHD threshold magnetic field is the same (up to a factor $\sqrt{\gamma_0}$) as the DC saturation magnetic field, previously predicted by fully kinetic theory.

  We aim to identify QSO2 candidates in the redshift desert using optical and infrared photometry. At this intermediate redshift range, most of the prominent optical emission lines in QSO2 sources (e.g. CIV1549; [OIII]4959,5008) fall either outside the wavelength range of the SDSS optical spectra or in particularly noisy wavelength ranges, making QSO2 identification challenging. Therefore, we adopted a semi-supervised machine learning approach to select candidates in the SDSS galaxy sample. Recent applications of machine learning in astronomy focus on problems involving large data sets, with small data sets often being overlooked. We developed a few-shot learning approach for the identification and classification of rare-object classes using limited training data (200 sources). The new AMELIA pipeline uses a transfer-learning based approach with decision trees, distance-based, and deep learning methods to build a classifier capable of identifying rare objects on the basis of an observational training data set. We validated the performance of AMELIA by addressing the problem of identifying QSO2s at 1 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 2 using SDSS and WISE photometry, obtaining an F1-score above 0.8 in a supervised approach. We then used AMELIA to select new QSO2 candidates in the redshift desert and examined the nature of the candidates using SDSS spectra, when available. In particular, we identified a sub-population of [NeV]3426 emitters at z $\sim$ 1.1, which are highly likely to contain obscured AGNs. We used X-ray and radio cross-matching to validate our classification and investigated the performance of photometric criteria from the literature showing that our candidates have an inherent dusty nature. Finally, we derived physical properties for our QSO2 sample using photoionisation models and verified the AGN classification using an SED fitting.
