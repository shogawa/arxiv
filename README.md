  Using the data of eROSITA (extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) taken during the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1), we perform the first X-ray classification and population study in the field of Canis Major overdensity (CMa OD), which is a candidate for the remnant of a dwarf galaxy that is merging to the Milky Way disk. The study aims to identify the X-ray sources in CMa OD. For this purpose, we developed a classification algorithm using multi-wavelength criteria as a preliminary method for the classification of faint X-ray sources, specifically in regions with a high source number density. Out of a total number of 8311 X-ray sources, we have classified 1029 sources as Galactic stars and binaries in the foreground, 946 sources as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies in the background, and 435 sources with stellar counterparts, which can belong to either the MW or CMa OD. Among the sources with a stellar counterpart, we have identified 34 symbiotic star candidates, plus 335 sources, of which the infrared counterparts have properties of M-giants in CMa OD. Moreover, there is a known high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB, 4U 0728-25) in the field of our study, which, according to the Gaia parallax of its companion, seems to be a member of CMa OD. There is also a recently detected transient low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB, SRGt J071522.1-191609), which can be a member of CMa OD based on its companion that is most likely highly absorbed and is thus located behind the Galactic disk. In addition, we present the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of members and candidate members of CMa OD. It is dominated by sources with luminosities of &lt; 2*10^32-10^33 erg/s in the energy range of 0.2-2.3 keV, which are expected to be either accreting white dwarfs or quiescent LMXBs.

  Metallicity measurements in galaxies can give valuable clues about galaxy evolution. One of the mechanisms postulated for metallicity redistribution in galaxies is gas flows induced by AGN, but the details of this process remain elusive. We report the discovery of a positive radial gradient in the gas-phase metallicity of the narrow line region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7130, which is not found when considering the star-forming components in the galaxy disk. To determine gas-phase metallicities for each kinematic component, we use both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming (SF) strong-line abundance relations, as well as BPT diagnostic diagrams. These relations involve sensitive strong emission lines, namely [OIII]5007, [NII]6584, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [SII]6716, and [SII]6731, observed with the adaptive-optics-assisted mode of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The presence of a positive radial metallicity gradient only in the AGN ionized component suggests that metals may be transported from central areas to its purlieus by AGN activity.

  Traditional single-fibre spectroscopy provides a single galaxy spectrum, forming the basis for crucial parameter estimation. However, its accuracy can be compromised by various sources of contamination, such as the prominent \Ha~emission line originating from both Star-Forming (SF) regions and non-Star-Forming regions (NonSF), including Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The potential to dissect a spectrum into its SF and NonSF constituents holds the promise of significantly enhancing precision in parameter estimates. In contrast, Integral Field Unit (IFU) surveys present a solution to minimize contamination. These surveys examine spatially localized regions within galaxies, reducing the impact of mixed sources. Although an IFU survey's resulting spectrum covers a smaller region of a galaxy than single-fibre spectroscopy, it can still encompass a blend of heterogeneous sources. Our study introduces an innovative model informed by insights from the MaNGA IFU survey. This model enables the decomposition of galaxy spectra, including those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), into SF and NonSF components. Applying our model to these survey datasets produces two distinct spectra, one for SF and another for NonSF components, while conserving flux across wavelength bins. When these decomposed spectra are visualized on a BPT diagram, interesting patterns emerge. There is a significant shift in the placement of the NonSF decomposed spectra, as well as the emergence of two distinct clusters in the LINER and Seyfert regions. This shift highlights the key role of SF `contamination' in influencing the positioning of NonSF spectra within the BPT diagram.
