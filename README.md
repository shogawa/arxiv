  We use LCOGT observations (MJD $59434-59600$) with a total exposure time of $\simeq 50$ hours and a median cadence of $0.5$ days to measure the inter-band time delays (with respect to $u$) in the $g$, $r$, and $i$ continua of a highly variable AGN, 6dFGS gJ022550.0-060145. We also calculate the expected time delays of the X-ray reprocessing of a static Shakura \&amp; Sunyaev disk (SSD) according to the sources' luminosity and virial black-hole mass; the two parameters are measured from the optical spectrum of our spectroscopic observation via the Lijiang \SI{2.4}{\meter} telescope. It is found that the ratio of the measured time delays to the predicted ones is $2.6_{-1.3}^{+1.3}$. With optical light curves (MJD $53650-59880$) from our new LCOGT and archival ZTF, Pan-SATRRS, CSS, and ATLAS observations, and infrared (IR) WISE data (MJD $55214-59055$), we also measured time delays between WISE $W1$/$W2$ and the optical emission. $W1$ and $W2$ have time delays (with respect to V), $9.6^{+2.9}_{-1.6}\times 10^2$ days and $1.18^{+0.13}_{-0.10}\times 10^3$ days in the rest-frame, respectively; hence, the dusty torus of 6dFGS gJ022550.0-060145 should be compact. The time delays of $W1$ and $W2$ bands are higher than the dusty torus size-luminosity relationship of~\cite{Lyu2019}. By comparing the IR and optical variability amplitude, we find that the dust covering factors of $W1$ and $W2$ emission regions are 0.7 and 0.6, respectively. Future broad emission-line reverberation mapping of this target and the results of this work enable us to determine the sizes of the AGN main components simultaneously.

  The broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) traces gas close to the central supermassive black hole (BH). Recent reverberation mapping (RM) and interferometric spectro-astrometry data have enabled detailed investigations of the BLR structure and dynamics, as well as estimates of the BH mass. These exciting developments motivate comparative investigations of BLR structures using different broad emission lines. In this work, we have developed a method to simultaneously model multiple broad lines of the BLR from a single-epoch spectrum. We apply this method to the five strongest broad emission lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, Pa$\beta$, and He $I\;\lambda$5876) in the UV-to-NIR spectrum of NGC 3783, a nearby Type I AGN which has been well studied by RM and interferometric observations. Fixing the BH mass to the published value, we fit these line profiles simultaneously to constrain the BLR structure. We find that the differences between line profiles can be explained almost entirely as being due to different radial distributions of the line emission. We find that using multiple lines in this way also enables one to measure some important physical parameters, such as the inclination angle and virial factor of the BLR. The ratios of the derived BLR time lags are consistent with the expectation of theoretical model calculations and RM measurements.

  The past decade has seen significant advances in wide-field cm-wave very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which is timely given the wide-area, synoptic survey-driven strategy of major facilities across the electromagnetic spectrum. While wide-field VLBI poses significant post-processing challenges that can severely curtail its potential scientific yield, many developments in the km-scale connected-element interferometer sphere are directly applicable to addressing these. Here we present the design, processing, data products, and source counts from a deep (11 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$), quasi-uniform sensitivity, contiguous wide-field (160 arcmin$^2$) 1.6 GHz VLBI survey of the CANDELS GOODS-North field. This is one of the best-studied extragalactic fields at milli-arcsecond resolution and, therefore, is well-suited as a comparative study for our Tera-pixel VLBI image. The derived VLBI source counts show consistency with those measured in the COSMOS field, which broadly traces the AGN population detected in arcsecond-scale radio surveys. However, there is a distinctive flattening in the $ S_{\rm 1.4GHz}\sim$100-500 $\mu$Jy flux density range, which suggests a transition in the population of compact faint radio sources, qualitatively consistent with the excess source counts at 15 GHz that is argued to be an unmodelled population of radio cores. This survey approach will assist in deriving robust VLBI source counts and broadening the discovery space for future wide-field VLBI surveys, including VLBI with the Square Kilometre Array, which will include new large field-of-view antennas on the African continent at $\gtrsim$1000~km baselines. In addition, it may be useful in the design of both monitoring and/or rapidly triggered VLBI transient programmes.

  Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered numerous faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z\sim5$ and beyond. These objects are key to our understanding of the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), their co-evolution with host galaxies, as well as the role of AGN in cosmic reionization. Using photometric colors and size measurements, we perform a search for compact red objects in an array of blank deep JWST/NIRCam fields totaling $\sim340$ arcmin$^{2}$. Our careful selection yields 260 reddened AGN candidates at $4&lt;z_{\rm phot}&lt;9$, dominated by a point-source like central component ($\langle r_{\rm eff} \rangle =91^{+39}_{-23}$ pc) and displaying a dichotomy in their rest-frame colors (blue UV and red optical slopes). Quasar model fitting reveals our objects to be moderately dust extincted ($A_{\rm V}\sim1.6$), which is reflected in their inferred bolometric luminosities of $L_{\rm bol}$ = 10$^{44-47}$ erg/s, and fainter UV magnitudes $M_{\rm UV} \simeq$ $-17$ to $-22$. Thanks to the large areas explored, we extend the existing dusty AGN luminosity functions to both fainter and brighter magnitudes, confirming their number densities to be $\times100$ higher than for UV-selected quasars of similar magnitudes. At the same time they constitute only a small fraction of all UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts, but this percentage rises to $\sim$10 % for $M_{UV}\sim -22$ at $z\sim7$. Finally, assuming a conservative case of accretion at the Eddington rate, we place a lower limit on the SMBH mass function at $z\sim5$, finding it to be consistent with both theory and previous observations.
