  The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS) is expected to contain ~100 quasars that emitted their light when the universe was less than a billion years old, i.e. at z&gt;5.6. By selection, these quasars populate the bright end of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and their count offers a powerful demographic diagnostic of the parent super-massive black hole population. Of the &gt;~ 400 quasars that have been discovered at z&gt;5.6 to date, less than 15 % have been X-ray detected. We present a pilot survey to uncover the elusive X-ray luminous end of the distant quasar population. We have designed a quasar selection pipeline based on optical, infrared and X-ray imaging data from DES DR2, VHS DR5, CatWISE2020 and the eRASS. The core selection method relies on SED template fitting. We performed optical follow-up spectroscopy with the Magellan/LDSS3 instrument for the redshift confirmation of a subset of candidates. We have further obtained a deeper X-ray image of one of our candidates with Chandra ACIS-S. We report the discovery of five new quasars in the redshift range 5.6 &lt; z &lt; 6.1. Two of these quasars are detected in eRASS and are by selection X-ray ultra-luminous. These quasars are also detected at radio frequencies. The first one is a broad absorption line quasar which shows significant X-ray dimming over 3.5 years, i.e. about 6 months in the quasar rest frame. The second radio-detected quasar is a jetted source with compact morphology. We show that a blazar configuration is likely for this source, making it the second most distant blazar known to date. With our pilot study, we demonstrate the power of eROSITA as a discovery machine for luminous quasars in the epoch of reionization. The X-ray emission of the two eROSITA detected quasars are likely to be driven by different high-energetic emission mechanisms a diversity which will be further explored in a future systematic full-hemisphere survey.

  Filaments of cold gas ($T\leq 10^{4}$ K) are found in the inner regions of many cool-core clusters. These structures are thought to play a major role in the regulation of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We study the morphology of the filaments, their formation, and their impact on the propagation of the outflowing AGN jets. We present a set of GPU-accelerated 3D (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster using the performance portable code AthenaPK. We include radiative cooling, and a self-regulated AGN feedback model that redistributes accreted material through kinetic, thermal and magnetic feedback. We confirm that magnetic fields play an important role in both the formation and evolution of the cold material. These suppress the formation of massive cold disks and favor magnetically supported filaments over clumpy structures. Achieving resolutions of $25-50$ pc, we find that filaments are not monolithic as they contain numerous and complex magnetically--supported substructures. We find that the mass distribution of these clumps follows a power law for all investigated filaments, consistent with previous cloud-crushing simulations of individual clumps. Studying the evolution of individual filaments, we find that their formation pathways can be diverse. We find examples of filaments forming through a combination of cold gas uplifting and condensation, as well as systems of purely infalling clumps condensing out of the intracluster medium. The density contrast between the cold gas and the outflowing hot material leads to recurring deflections of the jets, favoring inflation of bubbles.

  The newly updated \texttt{GIZMO} and \texttt{Simba} based simulation, \texttt{Simba-C}, with its new stellar feedback, chemical enrichment, and recalibrated AGN feedback, allows for a detailed study of the intragroup medium X-ray properties. We discuss the impact of various physical mechanisms, e.g. stellar and AGN feedback, and chemical enrichment, on the composition and the global scaling relations of nearby galaxy groups. We also study the evolution ($z=2$ to $0$) of the global properties for the $1\,\mathrm{keV}$ temperature groups. \texttt{Simba-C} shows improved consistent matching with the observations of all X-ray scaling relations compared to \texttt{Simba}. It is well known that AGN feedback has a significant influence on $L_{X,0.5-2.0}-T_{spec,corr}$, $S_{500/2500}-T_{spec,corr}$, and gas mass fractions, with our \texttt{Simba-C} results consistent with it. Our recalibrated AGN feedback strength also showed an additional improvement in gas entropy, which now aligns with CLoGS observations. The updated stellar feedback and chemical enrichment model is shown to play an important role in our understanding of the chemical abundance ratios and their evolution within galaxy groups. In particular, we find that \texttt{Simba-C} produces an increase in the amount of heavier elements (specifically Si and Fe) relative to O, compared to \texttt{Simba}.

  We present a complete census of candidate nuggets, i.e., dense galaxies likely formed by compaction with intense gas influx, within the volume-limited $z \sim 0$ REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) survey. These nuggets span all evolutionary stages and 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass ($M_{*} \sim 10^{8} M_\odot$ to $10^{11} M_\odot$) from the dwarf to the giant regime. We develop selection criteria for our $z\sim0$ nugget candidates based on structure and introduce the use of environmental criteria to eliminate nugget-like objects with suspected non-compaction origins. The resulting $z\sim0$ nuggets follow expectations with respect to structure (i.e., density, size), population frequency, and likely origins. We show that the properties of our nugget census are consistent with permanent quenching above the gas-richness threshold scale (halo mass $M_{halo} \sim 10^{11.4} M_\odot$), cyclic temporary quenching below the threshold scale, and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) assisting in permanent quenching. As predicted in simulations, most nuggets quench within the halo mass range $M_{halo} \sim 10^{11.45} M_\odot$ to $10^{11.9} M_\odot$. We find $\sim 0.29$ dex scatter around the star-forming main sequence for candidate blue nuggets below the threshold scale, which is consistent with temporary quenching as seen in simulations. A transitional population of green nuggets appears above the threshold scale. AGN also become more common in nuggets above this scale, and we see a likely AGN excess in nuggets vs. comparably selected non-nuggets. Our results provide the first observational confirmation of the mass-dependent, AGN-mediated shift from cyclic quenching to halo quenching in nuggets.

  Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) show signs of Nitrogen enrichment reminiscent of other astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies. Given that TDEs probe the gas from a single star, it is possible to test if the observed enrichment is consistent with expectations from the CNO cycle by looking at the observed Nitrogen/Carbon (N/C) abundance ratios. Given that $\approx 20\%$ of solar mass stars (and an even larger fraction of more massive stars) live in close binaries, it is worthwhile to also consider what TDEs from stars influenced by binary evolution would look like. We show here that TDEs from stars stripped of their Hydrogen-rich (and Nitrogen-poor) envelopes through previous binary-induced mass loss can produce much higher observable N/C enhancements than even TDEs from massive stars. Additionally, we predict that the time-dependence of the N/C abundance ratio in the mass fallback rate of stripped stars will follow the inverse behavior of main-sequence stars, enabling a more accurate characterization of the disrupted star.

  Stellar and AGN feedback primarily affect the formation and evolution of galaxies and the circumgalactic medium, leaving some imprint on larger scales. Based on the SIMBA hydrodynamical simulation suite, and using the full set of Minkowski functionals (MFs), this study systematically analyses the time evolution of the global geometry and topology of the gas temperature, pressure, density (total, HI and H$_2$), and metallicity fields between redshift $z=5$ and $z=0$. MFs show that small-scale astrophysical processes are persistent and manifest on larger, up to tens of Mpc scales, highlighting the specific morphological signatures of the relevant feedback mechanisms on such scales in the last $\sim12$~Gyr. In qualitative terms, one can establish a ranking that varies according to the field considered: stellar feedback mostly determines the morphology of the pressure and density fields, AGN jets are the first cause for the morphology of the temperature and metallicity fields, while X-ray heating and AGN winds play the second most important role in shaping the geometry and topology of all the gaseous fields but metallicity. Hence the cosmic evolution of the geometry and topology of fields characterising the thermodynamical and chemical properties of the cosmic web provides complementary larger-scale constraints to galaxy formation models.

  Redshift estimation and the classification of gamma-ray AGNs represent crucial challenges in the field of gamma-ray astronomy. Recent efforts have been made to tackle these problems using traditional machine learning methods. However, the simplicity of existing algorithms, combined with their basic implementations, underscores an opportunity and a need for further advancement in this area. Our approach begins by implementing a Bayesian model for redshift estimation, which can account for uncertainty while providing predictions with the desired confidence level. Subsequently, we address the classification problem by leveraging intelligent initialization techniques and employing soft voting. Additionally, we explore several potential self-supervised algorithms in their conventional form. Lastly, in addition to generating predictions for data with missing outputs, we ensure that the theoretical assertions put forth by both algorithms mutually reinforce each other.
