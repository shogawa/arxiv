  With the launch of JWST, understanding star formation in the early Universe is an active frontier in modern astrophysics. Whether the higher gas pressures and lower metallicities in the early Universe altered the shape of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) remains a fundamental open question. Since the IMF impacts nearly all observable properties of galaxies and controls how stars regulate galaxy growth, determining whether the IMF is variable is crucial for understanding galaxy formation. Here we report the detection of two Lyman-$\alpha$-emitting galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization with exceptionally top-heavy IMFs. Our analysis of JWST/NIRSpec data demonstrates that these galaxies exhibit spectra which are completely dominated by the nebular continuum. In addition to a clear Balmer jump, we observe a steep turnover in the ultraviolet continuum. Although this feature can be reproduced with a contrived damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption model, we show instead that this is two-photon emission from neutral hydrogen. Two-photon emission can only dominate if the ionizing emissivity is $\gtrsim10\times$ that of a typical star-forming galaxy. While weak He~{\sc~II} emission disfavours ionizing contributions from AGN or X-ray binaries, such radiation fields can be produced in star clusters dominated by low-metallicity stars of $\gtrsim50\ {\rm M_{\odot}}$, where the IMF is $10-30\times$ more top-heavy than typically assumed. Such a top-heavy IMF implies our understanding of star formation in the early Universe and the sources of reionization may need revision.

  We present a comprehensive variability study on three blazars, S4 0954+65, PKS 0903-57, and 4C +01.02 covering a mass range of log(M/M$_{\odot}$) = 8--9, by using $\sim$15 years-long $\gamma$-ray light curves from \textit{Fermi}-LAT. The variability level is characterized by the fractional variability amplitude which is higher for $\gamma$-rays compared to optical/UV and X-rays emissions. A power spectral density (PSD) study and damped random walk (DRW) modeling are done to probe the characteristic timescale. The PSD is fitted with a single power-law (PL) and bending power-law models and the corresponding success fraction was estimated. In the case of PKS 0903-57, We observed a break in the $\gamma$-ray PSD at 256 days which is comparable to the viscous timescale in the accretion disc suggesting a possible disk-jet coupling. The non-thermal damping timescale from the DRW modeling is compared with the thermal damping timescale for AGNs including our three sources. Our sources lie on the best-fit of the $\mathrm{\tau^{rest}_{damping}} - M_{BH}$ plot derived for AGN suggesting a possible accretion disc-jet connection. If the jet's variability is linked to the disc's variability, we expect a log-normal flux distribution, often connected to the accretion disc's multiplicative processes. Our study observed a double log-normal flux distribution, possibly linked to long and short-term variability from the accretion disk and the jet. In summary, PSD and DRW modeling results for these three sources combined with blazars and AGNs studied in literature favor a disc-jet coupling scenario. However, more such studies are needed to refine this understanding.

  A complete understanding of the mass assembly history of structures in the universe requires the study of the growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) as a function of their local environment over cosmic time. In this context, it is important to quantify the effects that the early stages of galaxy cluster development have on the growth of SMBHs. We used a sample of Herschel/SPIRE sources of $\sim$ 228 red and compact Planck-selected protocluster (PC) candidates to estimate the active galactic nuclei (AGN) fraction from a large sample of galaxies within these candidates. We estimate the AGN fraction by using the mid-infrared (mid-IR) photometry provided by the WISE/AllWISE data of $\sim650$ counterparts at high redshifts. We created an AllWISE mid-IR colour-colour selection using a clustering machine learning algorithm and two {\it WISE} colour cuts using the 3.4 $\mu m$ (W1), 4.6 $\mu m$ (W2) and 12 $\mu m$ (W3) passbands, to classify sources as AGN. We also compare the AGN fraction in PCs with that in the field to better understand the influence of the environment on galaxy development. We found an AGN fraction of $f_{AGN} = 0.113 \pm 0.03$ in PC candidates and an AGN fraction of $f_{AGN} = 0.095 \pm 0.013$ in the field. We also selected a subsample of `red' SPIRE subsample with a higher overdensity significance, obtaining $f_{AGN} = 0.186 \pm 0.044$, versus $f_{AGN} = 0.037 \pm 0.010$ of `non-red sources', consistent with higher AGN fractions for denser environments. We conclude that our results point towards a higher AGN fraction in PCs, similar to other studies.

  In this study, we analyse the characteristics of stellar populations and the interstellar medium (ISM) in 15,107 early-type central galaxies from the SPIDER survey. Using optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we investigate stellar age (Age), metallicity ($Z$), visual extinction ($A_{\rm V}$), and H$\alpha$ equivalent width (EWH$\alpha$) to understand the evolution of the baryonic content in these galaxies. Our analysis explores the relationship between these properties and central velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) and halo mass ($M_{\rm halo}$) for isolated centrals (ICs) and group centrals (GCs). Our results confirm that both ICs and GCs' stellar populations and gas properties are mainly influenced by $\sigma$, with $M_{\rm halo}$ playing a secondary role. Higher $\sigma$ values correspond to older, more metal-rich stellar populations in both ICs and GCs. Moreover, fixed $\sigma$ values we observe younger Ages at higher values of $M_{\rm halo}$, a consistent trend in both ICs and GCs. Furthermore, we investigate the ionisation source of the warm gas and propose a scenario where the properties of ionised gas are shaped by a combination of cooling within the intra-cluster medium (ICM) and feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) assuming a Bondi accretion regime. We observe inherent differences between ICs and GCs, suggesting that the ratio between AGN kinetic power and ICM thermal energy influences EWH$\alpha$ in ICs. Meanwhile, gas deposition in GCs appears to involve a more complex interplay beyond a singular AGN-ICM interaction.

  Black holes can amplify incoming bosonic waves via rotational superradiance, inducing bound states of ultralight bosons around them. This phenomenon has the potential to confine the parameter spaces of new bosons. Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are candidate beyond-standard-model particles that can form such clouds around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and impact the polarization signal in a similar fashion to Faraday rotation via axion-photon coupling. Prior efforts have used polarized images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) M87 2017 observations to limit the dimensionless axion-photon coupling to previously unexplored regions. However, with the novel calibration-insensitive quantities, closure traces and conjugate closure trace products, it is possible to constrain the existence of axion clouds while avoiding the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties, e.g., station gains and polarization leakages. We utilize a simple geometric model for the polarization map of M87* to fit the model parameters with both simulated and real data sets and reach a comparable level of constraint in the accuracy with which an axion cloud may be excluded in M87. Future applications of our approach include subsequent M87* and Sgr A* observations by EHT and next-generation EHT (ngEHT) are expected to produce stronger constraints across a wider range of axion and ALP masses. Because it does not require imaging, closure trace analyses may be applied to target AGN for which imaging is marginal, extending the number of SMBHs from which axion limits may be obtained significantly.

  We present preliminary results of the analysis of optical spectra of two complementary samples of Seyfert galaxies. The first sample was extracted from a selection of the 4th Fermi Gamma-ray Large Area Telescope (4FGL) catalog, and consists of 9 $\gamma$-ray emitting jetted Seyfert galaxies. The second one was extracted from the Swift-BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), and is composed of 38 hard-X ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These two samples are complementary, with the former expected to have smaller viewing angles, while the latter may include objects with larger viewing angles. We measured emission line ratios to investigate whether the behavior of these Seyferts can be explained in terms of obscuration, as suggested by the well-known Unified Model (UM) of AGN, or if there are intrinsic differences due to the presence of jets, outflows, or the evolution. We found no indications of intrinsic differences. The UM remains the most plausible interpretation for these classes of objects even if some results can be challenging for this model.

  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations generate explosive feedback that regulates star formation in massive galaxies, modifying the gas phase structure out to large distances. Here, we explore the direct effects that AGN radiation has on gas heating and cooling within one high-resolution $z=3$ dark matter halo as massive as a quasar host ($M_{\rm h}=$10$^{\rm 12.5}$M$_{\rm\odot}$), run without AGN feedback. We assume AGN radiation to impact the circumgalactic medium (CGM) anisotropically, within a bi-cone of angle $\alpha$. We find that even a relatively weak AGN (black hole mass $M_{\rm\bullet}=10^{\rm 8}$M$_{\rm\odot}$ with an Eddington ratio $\lambda=0.1$) can significantly lower the fraction of halo gas that is catastrophically cooling compared to the case of gas photoionized only by the ultraviolet background (UVB). Varying $M_{\rm\bullet}$, $\lambda$ and $\alpha$, we study their effects on observables. A 10$^{\rm 9}$M$_{\rm\odot}$ AGN with $\lambda=0.1$ and $\alpha\approxeq60^{^{\rm o}}$ reproduces the average surface brightness (SB) profiles of Ly$\alpha$, HeII and CIV, and results in a covering fraction of optically thick absorbers within observational estimates. The simulated SB$_{\rm CIV}$ profile is steeper than observed, indicating that not enough metals are pushed beyond the very inner CGM. For this combination of parameters, the CGM mass catastrophically cooling is reduced by half with respect to the UVB-only case, with roughly same mass out of hydrostatic equilibrium heating up and cooling down, hinting to the importance of self-regulation around AGNs. This study showcases how CGM observations can constrain not only the properties of the CGM itself, but also those of the AGN engine.

  In this second study of the `Resolving supermAssive Black hole Binaries In galacTic hydrodynamical Simulations' (RABBITS) series, we focus on the hardening and coalescing process of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in galaxy mergers. For simulations including different galaxy formation processes (i.e. gas cooling, star formation, SMBH accretion, stellar and AGN feedback), we systematically control the effect of stochastic eccentricity by fixing it to similar values during the SMBH hardening phase. We find a strong correlation between the SMBH merger time-scales and the presence of nuclear star formation. Throughout the galaxy merging process, gas condenses at the centre due to cooling and tidal torques, leading to nuclear star formation. These recently formed stars, which inherit low angular momenta from the gas, contribute to the loss cone and assist in the SMBH hardening via three-body interactions. Compared to non-radiative hydrodynamical runs, the SMBH merger time-scales measured from the runs including cooling, stellar and SMBH physical processes tend to be shortened by a factor of ${\sim}1.7$. After fixing the eccentricity to the range of $e \sim 0.6$--$0.8$ during the hardening phase, the simulations with AGN feedback reveal merger time-scales of ${\sim} 100$--$500$ Myr for disc mergers and ${\sim} 1$--$2$ Gyr for elliptical mergers. With a semi-analytical approach, we find that the torque interaction between the binary and its circumbinary disc has minimal impact on the shrinking of the binary orbit in our retrograde galaxy merger. Our results are useful in improving the modelling of SMBH merger time-scales and gravitational wave event rates.

  We introduce the `Resolving supermAssive Black hole Binaries In galacTic hydrodynamical Simulations' (RABBITS) series of studies to investigate the orbital evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) during galaxy mergers. We simulate both disc and elliptical galaxy mergers using the KETJU code, which can simultaneously follow galaxy (hydro-)dynamics and small-scale SMBH dynamics with post-Newtonian corrections. With our SMBH binary subgrid model, we show how active galactic nuclei (AGNs) feedback affects galaxy properties and SMBH coalescence. We find that simulations without AGN feedback exhibit excessive star formation, resulting in merger remnants that deviate from observed properties. Kinetic AGN feedback proves more effective than thermal AGN feedback in expelling gas from the centre and quenching star formation. The different central galaxy properties, which are a result of distinct AGN feedback models, lead to varying rates of SMBH orbital decay. In the dynamical friction phase, galaxies with higher star formation and higher SMBH masses possess denser centres, become more resistant to tidal stripping, experience greater dynamical friction, and consequently form SMBH binaries earlier. As AGN feedback reduces gas densities in the centres, dynamical friction by stars dominates over gas. In the SMBH hardening phase, compared to elliptical mergers, disc mergers exhibit higher central densities of newly formed stars, resulting in accelerated SMBH hardening and shorter merger time-scales (i.e. $\lesssim 500$ Myr versus $\gtrsim 1$ Gyr). Our findings highlight the importance of AGN feedback and its numerical implementation in understanding the SMBH coalescing process, a key focus for low-frequency gravitational wave observatories.

  Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the center of galaxies are typically surrounded by large quantities of gas and dust. The structure and evolution of this circumnuclear material can be studied at different wavelengths, from the submillimeter to the X-rays. Recent X-ray studies have shown that the covering factor of the obscuring material tends to decrease with increasing Eddington ratio, likely due to radiative feedback on dusty gas. Here we study a sample of 549 nearby (z&lt;0.1) hard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected non-blazar active galactic nuclei (AGN), and use the ratio between the AGN infrared and bolometric luminosity as a proxy of the covering factor. We find that, in agreement with what has been found by X-ray studies of the same sample, the covering factor decreases with increasing Eddington ratio. We also confirm previous findings which showed that obscured AGN typically have larger covering factors than unobscured sources. Finally, we find that the median covering factors of AGN located in different regions of the column density-Eddington ratio diagram are in good agreement with what would be expected from a radiation-regulated growth of SMBHs.
