  We utilize deep JWST NIRCam observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at z&gt;10. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at 6.5&lt;z&lt;13.5 taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the PEARLS, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totalling 187 arcmin2. We investigate the impact of SED fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFH), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. Whilst our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z&lt;13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75 dex increase in the SMD at z=10.5 between a flexible non-parametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z &gt; 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the 'Little Red Dot' galaxies dominate the z=7 GSMF at high-masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of AGN and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy IMF reduces stellar mass by 0.5 dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.

  In 2013, the IceCube collaboration announced the detection of a diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux. The origin of this flux is still largely unknown. The most significant individual source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at 4.2-sigma level with a soft spectral index. To identify sources based on their counterpart, IceCube releases realtime alerts corresponding to neutrinos with a high probability of astrophysical origin. We report here the spatial coincidence of two neutrino alerts, IC220424A and IC230416A, with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 at a distance of 70 Mpc. We evaluate, a-posteriori, the chance probability of such a coincidence and discuss this source as a neutrino emitter based on its multi-wavelength properties and in comparison to NGC 1068. To calculate the chance coincidence considering neutrino emission from a specific source population, we perform a Goodness-of-Fit test with a test statistic derived from a likelihood ratio that includes the neutrino angular uncertainty and the source distance. We apply this test first to a catalog of AGN sources and second to a catalog of Seyfert galaxies only. Our a-posteriori evaluation excludes the chance coincidence of the two neutrinos with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 at 3.3-sigma level. To be compatible with non-detections of TeV neutrinos, the source would need to have a hard spectral index.

  We investigated the properties of 94 [NeV]3426AA-selected type 2 AGN in COSMOS at z=0.6-1.2, performing optical-to-far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In addition, we analyze the X-ray spectra of the X-ray-detected sources to obtain reliable values of the AGN obscuration and intrinsic luminosity.   We found that more than two-thirds of our sample is composed of very obscured sources, with about 20% of the sources being candidate CT-AGN and half being AGNs in a strong phase of accretion. With respect to non-active galaxies, we find a higher fraction of sources within the main sequence and little evidence for AGNs quenching the SF. The comparison with the prediction from the in situ co-evolution model suggests that [NeV] is an effective tool for selecting galaxies in the obscured growth phase of the BH-galaxy co-evolution paradigm. We find that the "quenching phase" is still to come for most of the sample and only few galaxies show evidence of quenched SF activity.

  Radio-mode feedback associated with the active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the cores of galaxy clusters injects large amount of energy into the intracluster medium (ICM), offsetting radiative losses through X-ray emission. This mechanism prevents the ICM from rapidly cooling down and fueling extreme starburst activity as it accretes onto the central galaxies, and is therefore a key ingredient in the evolution of galaxy clusters. However, the influence and mode of feedback at high redshifts (z~1) remains largely unknown. Low-frequency sub-arcsecond resolution radio observations taken with the International LOFAR Telescope have demonstrated their ability to assist X-ray observations with constraining the energy output from the AGNs (or "cavity power") in galaxy clusters, thereby enabling research at higher redshifts than before. In this pilot project, we test this hybrid method on a high redshift (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.3) sample of 13 galaxy clusters for the first time with the aim of verifying the performance of this method at these redshifts and providing the first estimates of the cavity power associated with the central AGN for a sample of distant clusters. We were able to detect clear radio lobes in three out of thirteen galaxy clusters at redshifts 0.7&lt;z&lt;0.9, and use these detections in combination with ICM pressures surrounding the radio lobes obtained from standard profiles to calculate the corresponding cavity powers of the AGNs. By combining our results with the literature, the current data appear to suggest that the average cavity power peaked at a redshift of z~0.4 and slowly decreases toward higher redshifts. However, we require more and tighter constraints on the cavity volume and a better understanding of our observational systematics to confirm any deviation of the cavity power trend from a constant level.
