  We explore the influence of optical Fe II quasi-continuum on the measured spectral parameters in the 4150-5500 A range for the spectra of Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We assume that the broad line region is composed of two sub-regions: the very broad line region (VBLR) and the intermediate line region (ILR). We constructed a large set of synthetic AGN spectra by taking different portions of the VBLR and ILR contributions, where initially the VBLR and ILR model spectra were constructed on the basis of prototypes of two observed spectra with dominant VBLR (i.e. ILR) emission. To investigate the influence of the optical Fe II quasi-continuum on the AGN measured spectral parameters, we fit the power-law continuum and emission lines in a set of model spectra, as commonly done for observed AGN spectra. We then compared the spectral parameters obtained after the fitting procedure with those of the model. We find that the optical Fe II quasi-continuum can be very strong in the case of spectra with strong and very broad Fe II lines and it is difficult to fully separate it from the power-law continuum. This gives the effect of a slightly underestimated H$\beta$ width and underestimated fluxes of the H$\beta$ and Fe II lines, while the continuum flux is then slightly overestimated. The most affected spectral parameters are the line equivalent widths (EWs), especially EW Fe II, which may be strongly underestimated. We discuss the possible underlying physics in the quasar main sequence, as implied by the results of our spectral modelling. We find that the set of AGN model spectra assuming different ILR and VBLR contributions can aptly reproduce the quasar main sequence, that is, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) H$\beta$ versus Fe II/H$\beta$ anti-correlation, where both parameters in this anti-correlation are strongly dependent on the ILR and VBLR contribution rate.

  We present recent results of the TELAMON program, which is using the Effelsberg 100-m telescope to monitor the radio spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) under scrutiny in astroparticle physics, namely TeV blazars and neutrino-associated AGN. Our sample includes all known Northern TeV-emitting blazars as well as blazars positionally coincident with IceCube neutrino alerts. Polarization can give additional insight into the source properties, as the polarized emission is often found to vary on different timescales and amplitudes than the total intensity emission. Here, we present an overview of the polarization properties of the TeV-emitting TELAMON sources at four frequencies in the 20 mm and 7 mm bands. While at 7 mm roughly $82\,\%$ of all observed sources are found to be significantly polarized, for 20 mm the percentage is $\sim58\,\%$. We find that most of the sources exhibit mean fractional polarizations of $&lt;5\%$, matching the expectations of rather low polarization levels in these sources from previous studies at lower radio frequencies. Nevertheless, we demonstrate examples of how the polarized emission can provide additional information over the total intensity.

  We present a selection technique to detect Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the 3XMM/SDSS-DR7 cross-correlation. A subsample of 3481 X-ray sources that are detected in the hard band (2-8 keV) and have photometric redshifts constitute our parent sample. We first applied an automated spectral-fitting procedure to select highly absorbed sources (N_H &gt; 10^23 cm^-2). We found 184 highly absorbed candidates. Then, we performed the Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMCs) selection technique to find CT AGNs. We also tested the MCMC selection technique by applying Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the method is accurate at 90 percent independently of the nature of the underlying source. Our sample contains 52 bona fide CT AGNs. The CT AGNs were selected to have a range &gt; 0.75 of probability of being CT when either fitting with the two models Torus and MYTorus. About 75 percent of CT AGNs in our sample had probabilities &gt; 90 percent. From the spectral analysis, we significantly found an anticorrelation between the equivalent width of the neutral Fe K_{\alpha} line and the X-ray luminosity at 2-10 keV, the so-called X-ray Baldwin effect.

  The black hole (BH) binaries in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are expected to form mainly through scattering encounters in the ambient gaseous medium. Recent simulations, including our own, have confirmed this formation pathway is highly efficient. We perform 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of BH scattering encounters in AGN disks. Using a range of impact parameters, we probe the necessary conditions for binary capture and how different orbital trajectories affect the dissipative effects from the gas. We identify a single range of impact parameters, typically of width $\sim0.86-1.59$ binary Hill radii depending on AGN disk density, that reliably leads to binary formation. The periapsis of the first encounter is the primary variable that determines the outcome of the initial scattering. We find an associated power-law between the energy dissipated and the periapsis depth to be $\Delta E\propto r^{-b}$ with $b=0.42\pm0.16$, where deeper encounters dissipate more energy. Excluding accretion physics does not significantly alter these results. We identify the region of parameter space in initial energy vs impact parameter where a scattering leads to binary formation. Based on our findings, we provide a ready-to-use analytic criterion that utilises these two pre-encounter parameters to determine the outcome of an encounter, with a reliability rate of &gt;90\%. As the criterion is based directly on our simulations, it provides a reliable and highly physically motivated criterion for predicting binary scattering outcomes which can be used in population studies of BH binaries and mergers around AGN.
