  The search for robust evidence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is crucial for understanding black hole seeding process and the formation of supermassive black holes in the early Universe. NGC 4395 and POX 52 are two prototypical IMBH hosts, both exhibiting multi-line evidence of low-mass black hole activity. Here, we report the first detection of mid-infrared (MIR) lags in response to optical variability, with measurements of $3.0^{+2.4}_{-1.9}$ days for NGC 4395 and $35.2^{+14.2}_{-11.7}$ days for POX~52 at $3.4$ $\mu$m, respectively, using archival optical data and observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). This detection provides the first reverberation evidence of low-mass black hole activity in POX 52. The time lags of these two low-mass, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) generally follow the extent of the $R_{\rm dust}-L_{\rm 5100}$ relation found in higher-mass AGNs. Based on an empirical relation between the broad-line region and dusty torus size, we constrain the black hole mass of POX 52 to log($M_{\rm BH}$/$M_\odot$) = 5.5 $\pm$ 0.37 (systemic and statistical errors), confirming its IMBH nature. Furthermore, long-term optical continuum monitoring of POX 52 reveals a mild inter-band lag of $\lesssim$ 1 day. However, no significant intranight variability was detected during its one-night, high-cadence monitoring, which we attribute to the longer duty cycle of fast variability in POX 52 compared to that in NGC 4395.

  A popular class of models for interpreting quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions from galactic nuclei (QPEs) invoke collisions between an object on an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. There are strong links between QPE systems and those disks which formed following a tidal disruption event (TDE), and at least two events (AT2019qiz and AT2022upj) are known to have occurred following an otherwise typical TDE. We show that the fact that these disks were formed following a TDE strongly constrains their properties, more so than previous models have assumed. Models based on steady-state AGN-like disks have mass contents which grow strongly with size $M_{\rm disk}\propto R_{\rm out}^{7/2}$ and do not conserve the mass or angular momentum of the disrupted star. A very different scaling must be satisfied by a TDE disk in order to conserve the disrupted stars angular momentum, $M_{\rm disk} \propto R_{\rm out}^{-1/2}$. These constraints substantially change the predicted scaling relationships between QPE observables (luminosity, duration, energy, temperature) and the QPE period. They also allow QPE observables to be written in terms of the properties of the two stars assumed to be involved (the one tidally disrupted and the one on an EMRI), making plausibility tests of these models possible. We show that these modifications to the disk structure imply that (i) QPEs cannot be powered by collisions between an orbiting black hole and a TDE disk, (ii) QPEs also cannot be powered by collisions between the surface of a stellar EMRI and a TDE disk. A framework in which the collisions are between a TDE disk and a star which has puffed up to fill its Hills sphere with a trailing debris stream (as seen in recent simulations) cannot be ruled out from the data, and should be the focus of further study.

  Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of galaxies emit continuous gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz frequencies, and ongoing pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments aim to detect the first individual system. Identifying the exact host galaxy of a SMBHB detected in GWs is paramount for a variety of multi-messenger science cases, but it will be challenging due to the large number of candidate galaxies in the sky localization region. Here, we apply recent insights on the distinct characteristics of SMBHB host galaxies to archival galaxy datasets, to predict which nearby massive galaxies are most likely to host SMBHBs detectable by PTAs. Specifically, we use archival galaxy IFU surveys to search for nearby galaxies with distinct stellar kinematic signatures of SMBHB host galaxies, as informed by cosmological simulations. These distinct stellar kinematic signatures, including slow rotation and strong kinematic/photometric misalignments, are a hallmark of recent major galaxy mergers that led to the formation of SMBHBs in these galaxies. We produce a list of nearby massive galaxies that may currently host SMBHBs, ranked by a combination of their host galaxy stellar kinematic properties and their hypothetical GW strain. We discuss how our ranked list can be used (1) for targeted searches for individual sources of continuous GWs by PTAs, (2) to corroborate candidate SMBHBs identified through other approaches, and (3) to select candidate recoiling AGN and closely-separated (&lt;100 pc) dual AGN for telescope follow-up confirmation.
