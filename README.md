  The structure of accretion flows in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) at low Eddington ratios (~10^-2 to 10^-3) are poorly-understood, and can be probed using the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of faded changing-look (CL) quasars. Previous results using single-epoch X-ray and rest-frame UV observations of samples of faded CL quasars suggest that their SED properties at low Eddington ratios display similarities to X-ray binaries fading from outburst. However, more robust tests demand multi-epoch observations that can trace the temporal behavior of the SEDs of individual AGN at low Eddington ratios. Here, we perform this test, by obtaining a second epoch of UV and X-ray observations of a sample of three faded CL quasars with bolometric Eddington ratios of &lt;10^-3, using a combination of contemporaneous HST UV imaging, Chandra X-ray observations, and optical spectroscopy. We find that all three CL quasars varied in luminosity, and their optical-to-X-ray spectral indices alpha_OX all individually display a negative (harder-when-brighter) correlation with Eddington ratio. This SED evolution is also often observed in X-ray binaries at low Eddington ratios, and adds to the growing evidence that AGN accretion flows behave analogously to X-ray binaries across all accretion states.

  Context. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star forming galaxies (SFGs) are the primary sources of extragalactic radio sky. But it is difficult to distinguish the radio emission produced by AGNs from that by SFGs, especially when the radio sources are faint. Best et al. (2023) classified the radio sources in LoTSS Deep Fields DR1 through multiwavelength SED fitting. With the classification results of them, we perform a supervised machine learning to distinguish radio AGNs and radio SFGs.   Aims. We aim to provide a supervised classifier to identify radio AGNs, which can get both high purity and completeness simultaneously, and can easily be applied to datasets of large-area surveys.   Methods. The classifications of Best et al. (2023) are used as the true labels for supervised machine learning. With the cross-matched sample of LoTSS Deep Fields DR1, AllWISE and Gaia DR3, the features of optical and mid-infrared magnitude and colors, are applied to train the classifier. The performance of the classifier is evaluated mainly by the precission, recall and F1 score of both AGNs and non-AGNs.   Results. By comparing the performance of six learning algorithms, CatBoost is chosen to construct the best classifier. The best classifier get precision = 0.974, recall = 0.865 and F1 = 0.916 for AGNs, precision = 0.936, recall = 0.988 and F1 = 0.961 for non-AGNs. After applying our classifier to the cross-matched sample of LoTSS DR2, AllWISE and Gaia DR3, we obtain a sample of 49716 AGNs and 102261 non-AGNs. The reliability of these classification results is confirmed by comparing with the spectroscopic classification of SDSS. The precission and recall of AGN sample can be as high as 94.2% and 92.3%, respectively. We also train a model to identify radio excess sources. The F1 scores are 0.610 and 0.965 for sources with and without radio excess, respectively.

  With excellent spectral and angular resolutions and, especially, sensitivity, the JWST allows us to observe infrared emission lines that were previously inaccessible or barely accessible. These emission lines are promising for evaluating the physical conditions in different galaxies. Based on {\sc MAPPINGS V} photoionization models, we systematically analyze the dependence of over 20 mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission lines covered by the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST on the physical conditions of different galactic environments, in particular narrow line regions (NLRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that mid-IR emission lines of highly ionized argon (i.e., [Ar~{\small V}]7.90,13.10) and neon (i.e., [Ne~{\small V}]14.32,24.32, [Ne~{\small VI}]7.65) are effective in diagnosing the physical conditions in AGN. We accordingly propose new prescriptions to constrain the ionization parameter ($U$), peak energy of the AGN spectrum ($E_{\rm peak}$), metallicity ($\rm 12+log (O/H)$), and gas pressure ($P/k$) in AGN. These new calibrations are applied to the central regions of six Seyfert galaxies included in the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) as a proof of concept. We also discuss the similarity and difference in the calibrations of these diagnostics in AGN of different luminosities, highlighting the impact of hard X-ray emission and particularly radiative shocks, as well as the different diagnostics in star-forming regions. Finally, we propose diagnostic diagrams involving [Ar~{\small V}]7.90 and [Ne~{\small VI}]7.65 to demonstrate the feasibility of using the results of this study to distinguish galactic regions governed by different excitation sources.

  Beyond deepening our understanding of the formation, growth, and evolution of supermassive black holes, it is crucial to uncover the role of feeding and feedback processes from growing black holes (i.e., active galactic nucleus; AGN) in shaping the cosmic ecosystem. Such studies include understanding the dynamics of gas flows in the interstellar (ISM), circumgalactic (CGM), intracluster (ICM), and intergalactic media (IGM). As the output of a sub-group in Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) AGN Working Group, this Science Case Development Document (SCDD) proposes to use future HWO observations to solve the following questions. Which mechanism is dominant in triggering inflows/outflows through feedback? How is AGN activity triggered, and is it associated with circumnuclear star formation and what is the overall effect of AGN feedback on star formation (SF)? In AGN feedback, which mode is more influential and does AGN feedback operate similarly or differently in the local universe and at high redshift? To answer these questions, this SCDD proposes to use potential HWO observations as follows. Resolve and characterize the spatial distribution of ionized and cold/warm molecular gas, especially those in inflows/outflows; Explore the spatial coupling and potential stratification of multi-phase inflows/outflows on different physical scales and their resolved and global correlations with AGN and/or SF activities; Investigate whether corresponding outflows/jets induce shocks and/or fluctuations that trigger or suppress the formation of molecular clouds and hence new stars. Specifically, HWO's capabilities will enable us to achieve the above scientific goals while existing facilities lack the required combination of high-throughput ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) integral field unit (IFU) capabilities with simultaneously sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity.

  We report the detection of Ly${\alpha}$ in CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, a recently discovered AGN at z = 8.63 by Tripodi et al. (2024), in new NIRSpec/MSA G140H/F070LP observations. We detect broad Ly${\alpha}$ emission (FWHM $= 1540 \pm 260$ km/s) near the systemic velocity, which suggests a large ionizing bubble considering that the universe is almost fully neutral at the redshift. Through Ly${\alpha}$ line-shape modeling assuming a Stromgren sphere, we find a large bubble radius, $R_b = 1.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ pMpc, and a moderately high Ly${\alpha}$ escape fraction, $f_{esc} = 11 \pm 3$ %. The intrinsic line width is inferred to be broad ($2200 \pm 280$ km/s), likely originating in the broad-line region. Existing data indicate that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is within a mild overdensity, $\delta = 1.9^{+2.9}_{-0.7}$, suggesting that other galaxies in its proximity might have contributed to the formation of the bubble. The high N IV]${\lambda}$1488 / C IV${\lambda}$1548 and N IV]${\lambda}$1488 / O III]${\lambda}$1661 line ratios measured in existing NIRSpec/PRISM data indicate nitrogen enrichment in this metal-poor, low-luminosity AGN. The spectroscopic features are overall similar to other nitrogen-rich galaxies discovered in the literature, such as GN-z11 and GHZ2/GLASSz12. This suggests that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 may represent one of the evolutionary phases of those nitrogen-rich galaxies.

  Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) with mildly relativistic velocities are frequently observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The line-force-driving mechanism is often taken as a potential mechanism for driving UFOs. Due to the line-force-driven winds moving at mildly relativistic velocities, the special relativistic effects become important.There are two special relativistic effects: one is the influence of the disc rotation on the radiation field; the other is the radiation-drag effect. We wish to study the influence of the special relativistic effects on the line-force-driven winds, and we performed numerical simulations to investigate this.We find that the line-force-driven winds are significantly weakened when the special relativistic effects are considered. Compared with the case without special relativistic effects, when special relativistic effects are considered the winds are closer to the disc surface, the maximum speed of winds is reduced by $\sim$20 percent--70 percent, and the mass outflow rate and the kinetic power is significantly reduced.

  Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are a new class of distinct radio objects that has recently been discovered. The origin of these features is yet unclear because their peculiar properties are a challenge for our current understanding of astrophysical sources for diffuse radio emission. In this work we test the feasibility of major mergers in galaxy groups as a possible formation channel for ORCs. By modeling the assembly of a massive galaxy group with a final virial mass of $M_{200}\sim 10^{13}\, \rm M_\odot$ in a magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulation with on-the-fly cosmic ray treatment, we are able to derive the X-ray and radio properties of the system self-consistently and compare them to observations. We show that the X-ray properties for the simulated system are agreeing with characteristics of observed galaxy groups in the regarded mass range, legitimating the comparison between the radio properties of the simulated halo and those of observed ORCs. A major merger between two galaxies in the simulation is triggering a series of strong shocks in the circumgalactic medium, which in unison are forming a ring if the line of sight is perpendicular to the merger axis. The shock is rapidly expanding in radial direction and quickly reaches the virial radius of the halo. This formation channel can hence readily explain the morphology and large extent of ORCs. However, the inferred radio luminosity of these features is lower than for observed counterparts, while the degree of polarization seems to be systematically overpredicted by the simulation. Fossil cosmic ray populations from AGN and stellar feedback might be necessary to explain the full extent of the radio properties of ORCs, since diffusive shock acceleration was the only source term for non-thermal electrons considered in this work.
