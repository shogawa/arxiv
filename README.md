  We introduce our project, AGNSTRONG (Active Galactic Nuclei and STaR fOrmation in Nearby Galaxies). Our research goals encompass investigating the kinematic properties of ionized and molecular gas outflows, understanding the impact of AGN feedback, and exploring the coevolution dynamics between AGN strength activity and star formation activity. We aim to conduct a thorough analysis to determine whether there is an increase or suppression in SFRs among targets with and without powerful relativistic jets. Our sample consists of 35 nearby AGNs with and without powerful relativistic jet detections. Utilizing sub-millimeter (sub-mm) continuum observations at 450 {\mu}m and 850 {\mu}m from SCUBA-2 at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, we determine star-formation rates (SFRs) for our sources using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting models. Additionally, we employ high-quality, spatially resolved spectra from UV-optical to near-infrared bands obtained with the Double Spectrograph and Triple Spectrograph mounted on the 200-inch Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory to study their multiphase gas outflow properties. This paper presents an overview of our sample selection methodology, research strategy, and initial results of our project. We find that the SFRs determined without including the sub-mm data in the SED fitting are overestimated by approximately 0.08 dex compared to those estimated with the inclusion of sub-mm data. Additionally, we compare the estimated SFRs in our work with those traced by the 4000{\AA} break, as provided by the MPA-JHU catalog. We find that our determined SFRs are systematically higher than those traced by the 4000{\AA} break. Finally, we outline our future research plans.

  We investigate the black hole mass function (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF), focusing on the intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses down to $M_{\bullet}\sim10^4 M_\odot$. Based on the AGNs with a detected broad H$\alpha$ emission line, we construct a sample of 14,242 AGNs at redshift $z&lt;0.35$, including 243 IMBHs with $M_{\bullet}&lt;10^6 M_\odot$. By jointly modeling the BHMF and ERDF via the maximum posterior estimation, we find that the BHMF peaks at $\sim$$10^{6} M_\odot$ and exhibits a relatively constant value of $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}\,dex^{-1}}$ at the low-mass end. By comparing the derived BHMF of type 1 AGNs with the galaxy mass function based on the updated black hole mass - host galaxy stellar mass relation, we derive the active fraction. We also determine the active fraction for all AGNs using the upper and lower limit of the type 1 fraction. The active fraction decreases from 15%-40% for massive galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{10} M_\odot$) to lower than $\sim$2% for dwarf galaxies with $M_\star\sim10^8 M_\odot$. These results suggest that the black hole occupation fraction is expected to be $\sim$50% for low-mass galaxies ($M_\star\sim10^{8.5} M_\odot$-$10^9 M_\odot$) if the duty cycle is similar between intermediate mass and supermassive black holes.

  Merging galaxy clusters often host spectacular diffuse radio synchrotron sources. These sources can be explained by a non-thermal pool of relativistic electrons accelerated by shocks and turbulence in the intracluster medium. The origin of the pool and details of the cosmic ray transport and acceleration mechanisms in clusters are still open questions. Due to the often extremely steep spectral indices of diffuse radio emission, it is best studied at low frequencies. However, the lowest frequency window available to ground-based telescopes (10-30 MHz) has remained largely unexplored, as radio frequency interference and calibration problems related to the ionosphere become severe. Here, we present LOFAR observations from 16 to 168 MHz targeting the famous cluster Abell 2256. In the deepest-ever images at decametre wavelengths, we detect and resolve the radio halo, radio shock and various steep spectrum sources. We measure standard single power-law behaviour for the radio halo and radio shock spectra and find significant spectral index and curvature fluctuations across the radio halo, indicating an inhomogeneous emitting volume. In contrast to the straight power-law spectra of the large-scale diffuse sources, the various AGN-related sources often show extreme steepening towards higher frequencies and flattening towards low frequencies. We also discover a new fossil plasma source with a steep spectrum between 23 and 144 MHz, with $\alpha=-1.9\pm 0.1$. Finally, by comparing radio and gamma-ray observations, we rule out purely hadronic models for the radio halo origin in Abell 2256, unless the magnetic field strength in the cluster is exceptionally high, which is unsupportable by energetic arguments and inconsistent with the knowledge of other cluster magnetic fields.

  The brightest steady sources of radiation in the universe, active galactic nuclei (AGN), are powered by gas accretion onto a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The large sizes and accretion rates implicated in AGN accretion disks are expected to lead to gravitational instability and fragmentation, effectively cutting off mass inflow to the SMBH. Radiative feedback from disk-embedded stars has been invoked to yield marginally stable, steady-state solutions in the outer disks. Here, we examine the consequences of this star formation with a semi-analytical model in which stellar-mass black hole (sBH) remnants in the disk provide an additional source of stabilizing radiative feedback. Assuming star formation seeds the embedded sBH population, we model the time-evolving feedback from both stars and the growing population of accreting sBHs. We find that in the outer disk, the luminosity of the sBHs quickly dominates that of their parent stars. However, because sBHs consume less gas than stars to stabilize the disk, the presence of the sBHs enhances the mass flux to the inner disk. As a result, star formation persists over the lifetime of the AGN, damped in the outer disk, but amplified in a narrow ring in the inner disk. Heating from the embedded sBHs significantly modifies the disk's temperature profile and hardens its spectral energy distribution, and direct emission from the sBHs adds a new hard X ray component, resembling a Compton reflection "hump".   

The X-ray rise and fall of the Recurrent Symbiotic System T CrB

  We present the analysis of publicly available NuSTAR, Suzaku and XMM-Newton observations of the recurrent symbiotic system T CrB covering the 2006.77-2022.66 yr period. The X-ray spectra are analysed by adopting a model that includes a reflection component produced by the presence of the accretion disk. Our best-fit model requires a disk with a radius of 100 AU, effective thickness of 10 AU, averaged column density 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ and orientation of 50$^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight that contributes significantly to the total X-ray flux detected from T CrB, in addition to naturally producing the emission of the 6.4 keV Fe line. The spectral analysis suggests that the temperature of the boundary layer evolved from 14.8 keV in the steady-state phase (before 2016), to 2.8 keV in the 2017.24 epoch, to finally stabilise to about $\sim$8 keV in the subsequent epochs. Variations in the plasma temperature of the boundary layer are attributed to the evolution of the mass accretion rate using theoretical interpretations from an accretion disk model. The presence of emission lines in the high-resolution XMM-Newton RGS spectrum of 2017.24 prevents from adopting a black body emission model to fit the soft X-ray range. Instead, we use plasma emission models that suggest the presence of adiabatically-shocked gas produced by gas velocities of 110-200 km s$^{-1}$, very likely tracing jet-like ejections similar to what is found in other symbiotic systems. Given the the analysis of X-ray and optical data together, we show that T CrB has a similar evolution as black hole binaries, accreting neutron stars and AGN in the hardness-intensity diagram.

  Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is one of most commonly used techniques to study the dust properties in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Works implementing this technique commonly use radiative transfer models that assume a variety of dust properties. Despite the key role of this aspect, limited effort has been put forward to explore the chemical composition, the role of different optical properties, and the grain size distribution of dust, all of which can have a substantial impact on the theoretical radiative transfer calculations. In this work, we explore the role of the dust chemical composition in the AGN dusty torus through SED fitting to \emph{Spitzer}/IRS spectra of a sample of 49 nearby AGN with silicate features in emission. We implement a mineralogy model including the popular astronomical silicates and a set of oxides and amorphous silicates with different grain sizes. We find that best fits use principally porous alumina, periclase, and olivine. In terms of mass fractions, $\sim99\%$ of the dust is composed of dust grains of size $\rm{0.1 \mu m}$, with a $&lt;1\%$ contribution from $\rm{3 \mu m}$ grains. Moreover, the astronomical silicates have a very low occurrence in the best fits, suggesting that they are not the most suited dust species to reproduce the silicate features in our sample.
