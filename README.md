  Cold, neutral interstellar gas, the reservoir for star formation, is traced through the absorption of the 21-centimetre continuum radiation by neutral hydrogen (HI). Although detected in one hundred cases in the host galaxies of distant radio sources, only recently have column densities approaching the maximum value observed in Lyman-alpha absorption systems been found. Here we explore the implications these have for the hypothesis that the detection rate of HI absorption is dominated by photo-ionisation from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find, with the addition all of the current searches for HI absorption at z &gt; 0.1, a strong correlation between the HI absorption strength and the ionising photon rate, with the maximum value at which HI is detected remaining close to the theoretical value in which all of the neutral gas would be ionised in a large spiral galaxy (Q = 2.9e56 ionising photons/s). We also rule out other effects (excitation by the radio continuum and changing gas properties) as the dominant cause for the decrease in the detection rate with redshift. Furthermore, from the maximum theoretical column density we find that the five high column density systems have spin temperatures close to those of the Milky Way (T &lt; 300 K), whereas, from our model of a gaseous galactic disk, the HI detection at Q= 2.9e56 per s yields T~10 000 K, consistent with the gas being highly ionised.

  Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) frequently power jets that interact with the interstellar/circumgalactic medium (ISM/CGM), regulating star-formation in the galaxy. Highly supersonic jets launched by active galactic nuclei (AGN) power a cocoon that confines them and shocks the ambient medium. We build upon the models of narrow conical jets interacting with a smooth ambient medium, to include the effect of dense clouds that are an essential ingredient of a multiphase ISM. The key physical ingredient of this model is that the clouds along the supersonic jet-beam strongly decelerate the jet-head, but the subsonic cocoon easily moves around the clouds without much resistance. We propose scalings for important physical quantities -- cocoon pressure, head &amp; cocoon speed, and jet radius. We obtain, for the first time, the analytic condition on clumpiness of the ambient medium for the jet to dissipate within the cocoon and verify it with numerical simulations of conical jets interacting with a uniform ISM with embedded spherical clouds. A jet is defined to be dissipated when the cocoon speed exceeds the speed of the jet-head. We compare our models to more sophisticated numerical simulations, direct observations of jet-ISM interaction (e.g., quasar J1316+1753), and discuss implications for the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles. Our work also motivates effective subgrid models for AGN jet feedback in a clumpy ISM unresolved by the present generation of cosmological galaxy formation simulations.

  In this work, we compare the SMBH and host galaxy properties of X-ray obscured and unobscured AGN. For that purpose, we use $\sim 35 000$ X-ray detected AGN in the 4XMM-DR11 catalogue for which there are available measurements for their X-ray spectral parameters, from the XMM2Athena Horizon 2020 European project. We calculate the host galaxy properties via SED fitting analysis. Our final sample consists of 1 443 AGN. In the first part of our analysis, we use different N$_H$ thresholds (10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ or 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$), taking also into account the uncertainties associated with the N$_H$ measurements, to classify these sources into obscured and unobscured. We find that obscured AGN tend to live in more massive systems that have lower SFR compared to their unobscured counterparts. However, only the difference in stellar mass, M$_*$, appears statistically significant ($&gt;2\sigma$). The results do not depend on the N$_H$ threshold used to classify AGN. The differences in M$_*$ and SFR are not statistically significant for luminous AGN ($\rm log (L_{X,2-10 KeV}/erg s^{-1})&gt; 44$). Our findings also show that unobscured AGN have, on average, higher specific black hole accretion rates compared to their obscured counterparts. In the second part of our analysis, we cross-match the 1 443 X-ray AGN with the SDSS DR16 quasar catalogue to obtain information on the SMBH properties of our sources. This results in 271 type 1 AGN, at $\rm z&lt;1.9$. Our findings show that type 1 AGN with increased N$_H$ ($&gt;10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) tend to have higher M$_{BH}$ compared to AGN with lower N$_H$ values, at similar M$_*$. The M$_{BH}$/M$_*$ ratio remains consistent for N$_H$ values below 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, but it exhibits signs of an increase at higher N$_H$ values. Finally, we detect a correlation between $\Gamma$ and Eddington ratio, but only for type 1 sources with N$_H&lt;10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.

  We select a sample of 1,437 active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy properties from the Portsmouth group by detection of the high-ionization [Ne V] 3426 \r{A} emission line. We compare the fluxes of [Ne III] 3869 \r{A}, [O III] 5007 \r{A}, [O II] 3726, 3728 \r{A}, and [O I] 6300 \r{A} to that of [Ne V]. All four lines show a strong linear correlation with [Ne V], although lines from ions with lower ionization potentials have a lower correlation coefficient. We investigate the use of two forbidden-line ratio (FLR) diagnostic diagrams that do not rely on H$\alpha$ in order to classify high redshift galaxies. These use the [Ne III]/[O II] line ratio plotted against [O III]/[O I] and [O III]/[O II] respectively. We use photo-ionization modeling to characterize the behavior of the narrow-line region in AGN and star-forming regions and test the validity of our diagnostic diagrams. We also use a luminosity cutoff of log L[OIII] [erg/s] = 42, which lowers the contamination of the AGN region by star-forming galaxies down to 10% but does not remove Green Pea and Purple Grape galaxies from the AGN region. We also investigate the OHNO diagram which uses [Ne III]/[O II] plotted against [O III]/H$\beta$. Using our new diagnostic diagrams, we are able to reliably classify AGN up to a redshift of z $\leq$ 1.06, and add more than 822 new AGN to the [Ne V]-selected AGN sample.
