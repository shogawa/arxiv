  Context. Tailed radio galaxies are shaped by ram pressure owing to the high-velocity motion of their host through the intracluster medium (ICM). Recent works have reported on the increasing complexity of the phenomenology of tailed galaxies, with departures from theoretical ageing models and evidence of re-energising mechanisms, which are yet unclear. Aims. The nearby (z = 0.0894) galaxy cluster Abell 2142 hosts two tailed galaxies, namely T1 and T2, which exhibit peculiar morphological features. We aim to investigate the properties of T1 and T2 and constrain their spectral evolution, dynamics, and interactions with the ICM. Methods. We combined LOw Frequency Array (LOFAR), upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), Very Large Array (VLA), and MeerKAT data (from 30 MHz to 6.5 GHz) to carry out a detailed spectral analysis of T1 and T2. We analysed surface brightness profiles, measured integrated and spatially-resolved spectral indices, and performed a comparison with single injection ageing models. Chandra X-ray data were used to search for discontinuities in the ICM properties in the direction of the targets. Results. The spectral properties of T1 at low frequencies are predicted by ageing models, and provide constraints on the 3D dynamics of the host by assuming a constant velocity. However, sharp transitions along sub-regions of the tail, local surface brightness enhancements, and a spectral shape at high frequencies that is not predicted by models suggest a more complex scenario, possibly involving hydrodynamical instabilities and particle mixing. T2 exhibits unusual morphological and surface brightness features, and its spectral behaviour is not predicted by standard models. Two AGN outburst events during the infall of T2 towards the cluster centre could explain its properties.

  We present NIR spectroscopy using MMT/MMIRS for a sample of twenty-nine massive galaxies ($\mathrm{log\ M_* / M_{\odot} \gtrsim10}$) at $\mathrm{z\sim0.7}$ with optical spectroscopy from the LEGA-C survey. Having both optical and NIR spectroscopy at this redshift allows us to measure the full suite of rest-optical strong emission lines, enabling the study of ionization sources and the rest-optical selection of active galactic nuclei (AGN), as well as the measurement of dust-corrected $\mathrm{H\alpha}$-based SFRs. We find that eleven out of twenty-nine galaxies host AGN. We infer the nonparametric star formation histories with the SED fitting code \texttt{Prospector} and classify galaxies as star-forming, green valley, or quiescent based on their most recent sSFRs. We explore the connection between AGN activity and suppressed star formation and find that $89\pm15\%$ of galaxies in the green valley or below host AGN, while only $15\%\pm8\%$ of galaxies above the green valley host AGN. We construct the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) and find that the AGN host galaxies are 0.37 dex below the SFMS while galaxies without detectable AGN are consistent with being on the SFMS. However, when compared to a bootstrapped mass-matched sample, the SFRs of our sample of AGN host galaxies are consistent with the full LEGA-C sample. Based on this mass-matched analysis, we cannot rule out that this suppression of star formation is driven by other processes associated with the higher mass of the AGN sample. We therefore cannot link the presence of AGN activity to the quenching of star formation.

  We conduct a study on the relationship between galaxy environments and their active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity at high redshifts ($2.0&lt;z&lt;4.0$). Specifically, we study the AGN fraction in galaxies residing in a range of environments at these redshifts, from field galaxies to highly overdense peaks in the GOODS-S extragalactic field. Utilizing the extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations in this field, we measure local- and global-overdensities over a large a range of environments, including in several massive (M$_{tot}\geq10^{14.8}$M$_\odot$) protostructures. We employ a multi-wavelength AGN catalog consisting of AGN in nine different categories. Our analysis shows a higher AGN fraction (10.9$^{+3.6}_{-2.3}$%) for galaxies in the highest local-overdensity regions compared to the AGN fraction (1.9$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$%) of coeval field galaxies (a ~4$\sigma$ difference). This trend of increasing AGN fraction in denser environments relative to the field is present in all redshift bins. We also find this trend consistently present in all five AGN categories that have a sufficient number of AGN to make a meaningful comparison: mid-IR SED, mid-IR color, X-ray luminosity, X-ray-luminosity-to-radio-luminosity-ratio, and optical-spectroscopy. Our results also demonstrate a clear trend of higher (~4x) AGN fractions in denser environments for a given stellar mass. Additionally, we observe the same trend (though at a lower significance) with the global environment of galaxies, measured using a metric based on the projected distance of galaxies from their nearest massive ($M_{tot}&gt;10^{12.8}M_\odot$) overdense ($\sigma_\delta&gt;5.0$) peak, normalized with respect to the size of the peak. These findings indicate that the prevalence of AGN activity is highly dependent on the environment in which a host galaxy resides, even at early times in the formation history of the Universe.

  Cold gas and dust reprocess the X-ray emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN), producing spectro-polarimetric features in the X-ray band. The recent launch of IXPE allows for observations of this X-ray polarisation signal, encoding unique information on the circumnuclear medium of AGN. However, the models for interpreting these polarimetric data are under-explored and do not reach the same level of sophistication as the corresponding spectral models. We aim at closing the gap between the spectral and spectro-polarimetric modelling of AGN circumnuclear media by providing the tools for simulating X-ray polarisation in complex 3D transfer media alongside X-ray spectra. We lay out the framework for X-ray polarisation in 3D radiative transfer simulations and provide an implementation to the 3D radiative transfer code SKIRT, focussing on (de)polarisation due to scattering and fluorescent re-emission. As a first application, we studied a 2D toroidal reprocessor of cold gas, modelling the AGN circumnuclear medium. For the 2D torus model, we find a complex behaviour of the polarisation angle with photon energy, which we interpret as a balance between the reprocessed photon flux originating from different sky regions, with a direct link to the torus geometry. We calculated a large grid of AGN torus models and demonstrated how spatially resolved polarisation maps could form a useful tool for interpreting the geometrical information that is encoded in IXPE observations. With this work, we release high-resolution AGN torus templates that simultaneously describe X-ray spectra and spectro-polarimetry, for observational data fitting with XSPEC. The SKIRT code can now model X-ray polarisation simultaneously with X-ray spectra and provide synthetic spectro-polarimetric observations for complex 3D circumnuclear media, with all features of the established SKIRT framework available.

  We summarize all available 13CO and accompanying 12CO measurements of local galaxy centers in transitions of J=5-4 and higher, including new APEX 13CO(6-5) and 12CO(6-5) observations of 11 galaxies. The observed integrated temperature ratios of 12CO(6-5) to 12CO(1-0) range from 0.10 to 0.45. Multi-aperture data indicate that 13CO(6-5) is more centrally concentrated than 12CO(6-5). The emission of 12CO(6-5) and HCO+ but not HCN may be correlated. The new data are essential to constrain the physical properties of the galaxy center molecular gas even in a simple two-phase model approximating the more complex multi-phase structure. In all galaxies, except the Seyfert AGN galaxy NGC 1068, high J emission from the center is dominated by a dense (n = 100 000) and relatively cool (T = 20 to 60 K) high-pressure gas. In contrast, the low-J lines are dominated in most galaxies by low-pressure gas of a moderate density (n = 1000) and more elevated temperature (T = 60 to 150 K). The three exceptions with significant high-pressure gas contributions to the low J emission are all associated with active central star formation.

  We present results from the latest version of the GAEA model of galaxy formation coupled with merger trees extracted from the P-Millennium Simulation (PMS), which provides a better mass resolution, a larger volume and assumes cosmological parameters consistent with latest results from the Planck mission. The model includes, at the same time, a treatment for the partition of cold gas into atomic and molecular (H$_2$) components; a better treatment for environmental processes acting on satellite galaxies; an updated modelling of cold gas accretion on Super-Massive Black Hole and relative AGN feedback on the host galaxy. We compare GAEA predictions based on the PMS, with model realizations based on other simulations in the Millennium Suite at different resolution, showing that the new model provides a remarkable consistency in the statistical properties of galaxy populations. We interpret this as due to the interplay between AGN feedback and H$_2$-based SFR (both acting as regulators of the cold gas content). We then compare model predictions with available data for the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2pCF) in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;3. We show that GAEA runs are able to correctly recover the main dependencies of the 2pCF as a function of stellar mass (M$_\star$), star formation activity, HI-content and redshift for M$_\star$ &lt; 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ galaxies. Our model correctly captures both the distribution of galaxy populations in the Large Scale Structure and the interplay between the main physical processes regulating their baryonic content, both for central and satellite galaxies. At larger stellar masses GAEA underpredicts the 2pCF amplitude, suggesting that model massive galaxies live in less massive dark matter haloes. The model predicts a rather small redshift evolution of the clustering amplitude up to z$\sim$3, consistent with available observational evidence.

  Dwarf galaxies have historically posed challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model and, while many of the so-called 'dwarf galaxy problems' have been mitigated by incorporating baryonic processes, the observed diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves remains a contentious topic. Meanwhile, the growing observational samples of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies have prompted a paradigm shift in our understanding of dwarf galaxy evolution, traditionally thought to be regulated by stellar feedback. In this study, we explore the potential role of AGN feedback in shaping dark matter distributions and increasing the diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves, using a new suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of dwarf galaxies with the FIRE-3 model. Our findings indicate that the presence of active black holes (BHs) in dwarf galaxies can lead to diverse outcomes, ranging from cuspier to more core-like profiles. This variability arises from the dual role of BHs in providing additional feedback and regulating the extent of stellar feedback. Consistent with previous research, we find that AGN feedback is most impactful when cosmic ray (CR) modelling is included, with CRs from any source significantly influencing dark matter profiles. Overall, our results highlight that the interplay between stellar feedback, BHs, and CRs produces a broad spectrum of dark matter density profiles, which align with observed correlations between rotation curve shapes and baryonic dominance. This underscores the importance of including the full range of baryonic processes in dwarf galaxy simulations to address the persistent 'small-scale challenges' to the CDM paradigm.

  We describe the physical mechanisms of launching and acceleration of wind from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disk. We focus on the radiation line force driven and magnetic driven wind models, which operate on the accretion disk scale. We review the investigation histories of the two mechanisms and the most new results obtained recently. The ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) found in the hard X-ray bands are believed to directly originate from AGN accretion disks. We review the theoretical works applying the two mechanisms of wind to explain the UFOs. We briefly introduce the propagation of winds on a large scale which is important for AGN wind feedback study. Finally, the roles of wind in AGN feedback are briefly reviewed.

  We present the results of a four-year velocity-resolved reverberation mapping (RM) campaign of the changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) NGC 4151 during its outburst phase. By measuring the time lags of the \ha, \hb, \hg, \hei, and \heii\ emission lines, we confirm a stratified broad-line region (BLR) structure that aligns with predictions from photoionization models. Intriguingly, we observed an ``anti-breathing" phenomenon, where the lags of broad emission lines decreased with increasing luminosity, contrary to the typical expectation. This anomaly may be attributed to the influence of the ultraviolet-optical lag or non-virialized motions in the BLR gas. Velocity-resolved RM and ionization mapping analyses revealed rapid and significant changes in the BLR geometry and kinematics on timescales within one year, which cannot be interpreted by any single mechanism, such as an inhomogeneous BLR, variations in radiation pressure, or changes in the illuminated ionizing field. Additionally, the \hb\ lags of NGC 4151 and other CL-AGNs agree with the radius-luminosity relationship established for AGNs with low accretion rates, implying that the CL phenomenon is more likely driven by intrinsic changes in the accretion rate rather than obscuration. These findings provide new insights into the complex internal processes of CL-AGNs and highlight the importance of long-term, multi-line RM for understanding BLR structures, geometry, and kinematics.

  'Bare' active galactic nuclei (AGN) are a subclass of Type 1 AGN that show little or no intrinsic absorption. They offer an unobscured view of the central regions of the AGN and therefore serve as ideal targets to study the relativistic reflection features originating from the innermost regions of the accretion disc. We present a detailed broadband spectral analysis ($0.3 - 70$ keV) of one of the most luminous bare AGN in the local universe, RBS 1124 ($z= 0.208$) using a new, co-ordinated high signal-to-noise observation obtained by $\textit{XMM-Newton}$ and $\textit{NuSTAR}$. The source exhibits a power-law continuum with $\Gamma \sim$ 1.8 along with a soft excess below 2 keV, a weak neutral iron line and curvature at high energies ($\sim 30$ keV). The broadband spectrum, including the soft excess and the high-energy continuum, is well fit by the relativistic reflection model when the accretion disc is allowed to have densities of log$(n_{\rm e}$/cm$^{-3}$) $\gtrsim 19.2$. Our analysis therefore suggests that when high-density effects are considered, relativistic reflection remains a viable explanation for the soft excess.

  The role of radio mode AGN feedback on galaxy evolution is still under debate. In this study, we utilize a combination of radio continuum observations and optical integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data to explore the impact of radio AGN on the evolution of their host galaxies at both global and sub-galactic scales. We construct a comprehensive radio-IFS sample comprising 5578 galaxies with redshift z &lt; 0.15 by cross-matching the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) with the MaNGA survey. We revisit the tight linear radio continuum - star formation relation and quantify its intrinsic scatter, then use the relation to classify 616 radio-excess AGN with excessive radio luminosities over that expected from their star formation rate. Massive radio AGN host galaxies are predominantly quiescent systems, but the quenching level shows no correlation with the jet luminosity. The mass assembly histories derived from the stellar population synthesis model fitting agree with the cosmological simulations incorporating radio-mode AGN feedback models. We observe that radio AGN hosts grow faster than a control sample of galaxies matched in stellar mass, and the quenching age (~ 5 Gyr) is at larger lookback times than the typical radio jet age (&lt; 1 Gyr). By stacking the spectra in different radial bins and comparing results for radio AGN hosts and their controls, we find emission line excess features in the nuclear region of radio AGN hosts. This indicates that radio AGN are ionizing the surrounding interstellar medium in the vicinity of the nucleus. We also find that ongoing star formation in the outer regions of the galaxy is weaker if a radio jet is detected. Our findings support the scenario that the observed present-day radio AGN activity is not responsible for the past quenching of their hosts, but may help the host galaxies maintain quiescence through ionizing and heating the surrounding gas.

  An important current problem regarding the characterization of the central engine of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consists in determining the parameters of the black holes (BHs) hosted at their cores, especially their mass. Therefore, we aim to apply a full general relativistic method to estimate the parameters of the central supermassive BHs hosted at the center of the IC 2560 and UGC 3193 galaxies. In order to achieve this aim we implement a general relativistic BH rotation curves' method and estimate the BH parameters by fitting megamaser astrophysical data available in the literature with the help of a Bayesian statistical method. We calculate the mass of the aforementioned BHs, their positions on the sky as well as the recession velocities of the host galaxies. On the basis of our estimations, we compute for the first time the BH mass of the UGC 3193 AGN. We also calculate the gravitational redshift of the closest maser to these BHs, a general relativistic effect produced by the curvature of spacetime that has no Newtonian analogue.

  The confirmation of massive quiescent galaxies emerging within the first billion years of the universe poses intriguing questions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. There must be highly efficient process at work to shut down star formation in galaxies at cosmic dawn. I present the detection of neutral outflowing gas in a massive ($M_\ast = 1.2\times 10^{11} M_\odot$) recently quenched AGN-host galaxy at $z=4$ as a evidence that AGN-driven outflows could be one such mechanism. Based on JWST spectrum, the star formation rate of this has been declining with a rapid e-folding timescale of $\sim50$~Myrs. The current specific star formation rate is $5\times10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, roughly 40 times lower than that of the star-forming main sequence at comparable redshifts. Emission line ratios of [NeIII]/[OII] and [OIII]/H$\beta$ emission indicate the presence of an AGN. A series of FeII and MgII absorption lines appear blueshifted by $\sim250$ km~s$^{-1}$ relative to the stellar continuum, suggesting an outflow of neutral gas. The estimate mass outflow rate is approximately 7 times greater than star formation rate derived from the stellar continuum, implying that the suppression of star formation is likely due to gas being depleted by the AGN-driven outflow. This galaxy represents the most distant example of its kind known to date. This study offers a compelling explanation for the existence of massive quiescent galaxies in the first billion years of the universe.

  Aims: To unveil the influence of galaxy-galaxy interactions on material transport driven by galactic bars towards the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) galaxies and assess the efficiency of the combined mechanisms of interactions and bars in fueling massive black holes, we examine barred active galaxies in paired systems.   Methods: Our study targets barred AGN galaxies in pairs with projected separations $r_{p}&lt; 100 \rm \,kpc \,h^{-1}$ and relative radial velocities of $\Delta V&lt; 500 \rm \,km \,s^{-1}$ within $z&lt;0.1$, using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. To quantify the impact of interactions, we also created a control sample of barred active galaxies without companions, matched in redshift, absolute r-band magnitude, stellar mass, color, and stellar age. We assessed galactic bar structures through two-dimensional image modeling, considering their wide range of shapes and sizes that may affect material transport ability.   Results: We found that nuclear activity, measured by $Lum[OIII]$, increases as projected separations between galaxy pair members decrease. Barred AGN galaxies in close pairs ($r_p&lt;$ 25 kpc $h^{-1}$) show significantly higher nuclear activity compared to the control sample. Barred galaxies with close companions exhibit enhanced nuclear activity across all luminosity, stellar mass, and color ranges. Barred AGN with longer bars show more efficient nuclear activity than those with shorter bars, with a pronounced effect in close pair systems. Nuclear activity increases as pair separations decrease. Barred AGNs in close pairs undergoing major interactions show a substantial excess of high $Lum[OIII]$ values, reflecting increased accretion onto central black holes. These findings suggest that nearby galaxy companions enhance gas flows driven by galactic bars, amplifying central nuclear activity and influencing black hole accretion.

  Euclid will cover over 14000 $deg^{2}$ with two optical and near-infrared spectro-photometric instruments, and is expected to detect around ten million active galactic nuclei (AGN). This unique data set will make a considerable impact on our understanding of galaxy evolution and AGN. In this work we identify the best colour selection criteria for AGN, based only on Euclid photometry or including ancillary photometric observations, such as the data that will be available with the Rubin legacy survey of space and time (LSST) and observations already available from Spitzer/IRAC. The analysis is performed for unobscured AGN, obscured AGN, and composite (AGN and star-forming) objects. We make use of the spectro-photometric realisations of infrared-selected targets at all-z (SPRITZ) to create mock catalogues mimicking both the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) and the Euclid Deep Survey (EDS). Using these catalogues we estimate the best colour selection, maximising the harmonic mean (F1) of completeness and purity. The selection of unobscured AGN in both Euclid surveys is possible with Euclid photometry alone with F1=0.22-0.23, which can increase to F1=0.43-0.38 if we limit at z&gt;0.7. Such selection is improved once the Rubin/LSST filters (a combination of the u, g, r, or z filters) are considered, reaching F1=0.84 and 0.86 for the EDS and EWS, respectively. The combination of a Euclid colour with the [3.6]-[4.5] colour, which is possible only in the EDS, results in an F1-score of 0.59, improving the results using only Euclid filters, but worse than the selection combining Euclid and LSST. The selection of composite ($f_{{\rm AGN}}$=0.05-0.65 at 8-40 $\mu m$) and obscured AGN is challenging, with F1&lt;0.3 even when including ancillary data. This is driven by the similarities between the broad-band spectral energy distribution of these AGN and star-forming galaxies in the wavelength range 0.3-5 $\mu m$.
