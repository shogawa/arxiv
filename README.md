  We present new spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations of the known sample of extreme coronal line emitting galaxies (ECLEs) identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). With these new data, observations of the ECLE sample now span a period of two decades following their initial SDSS detections. We confirm the nonrecurrence of the iron coronal line signatures in five of the seven objects, further supporting their identification as the transient light echoes of tidal disruption events (TDEs). Photometric observations of these objects in optical bands show little overall evolution. In contrast, mid-infrared (MIR) observations show ongoing long-term declines. The remaining two objects had been classified as active galactic nuclei (AGN) with unusually strong coronal lines rather than being TDE related, given the persistence of the coronal lines in earlier follow-up spectra. We confirm this classification, with our spectra continuing to show the presence of strong, unchanged coronal-line features and AGN-like MIR colours and behaviour. We have constructed spectral templates of both subtypes of ECLE to aid in distinguishing the likely origin of newly discovered ECLEs. We highlight the need for higher cadence, and more rapid, follow-up observations of such objects to better constrain their properties and evolution. We also discuss the relationships between ECLEs, TDEs, and other identified transients having significant MIR variability.

  Multi-line molecular observations are an ideal tool for a systematic study of the physico-chemical processes in the Interstellar Medium (ISM), given the wide range of critical densities associated with different molecules and their transitions, and the dependencies of chemical reactions on the energy budget of the system. Recently high spatial resolution of typical shock tracers - SiO, HNCO, and CH3OH - have been studied in the potentially shocked regions in two nearby galaxies: NGC 1068 (an AGN-host galaxy) (Huang et al., Astron. Astrophys., 2022, 666, A102; Huang et al., in prep.) and NGC 253 (a starburst galaxy) (K.-Y. Huang et al., arXiv, 2023, preprint, arXiv:2303.12685, DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2303.12685). This paper is dedicated to the comparative study of these two distinctively different galaxies, with the aim of determining the differences in their energetics and understanding large-scale shocks in dfferent types of galaxies.

  Continuum reverberation mapping probes the sizescale of the optical continuum-emitting region in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Through 3 years of multiwavelength photometric monitoring in the optical with robotic observatories, we perform continuum reverberation mapping on Mrk~876. All wavebands show large amplitude variability and are well correlated. Slow variations in the light curves broaden the cross-correlation function (CCF) significantly, requiring detrending in order to robustly recover interband lags. We measure consistent interband lags using three techniques (CCF, JAVELIN, PyROA), with a lag of around 13~days from $u$ to $z$. These lags are longer than the expected radius of 12~days for the self-gravitating radius of the disk. The lags increase with wavelength roughly following $\lambda^{4/3}$, as would be expected from thin disk theory, but the lag normalization is approximately a factor of 3 longer than expected, as has also been observed in other AGN. The lag in the $i$ band shows an excess which we attribute to variable H$\alpha$ broad-line emission. A flux-flux analysis shows a variable spectrum that follows $f_\nu \propto \lambda^{-1/3}$ as expected for a disk, and an excess in the $i$ band that also points to strong variable H$\alpha$ emission in that band.

  It has been shown that the gas velocities within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be measured by applying novel XMM-Newton EPIC-pn energy scale calibration, which uses instrumental Cu Ka as reference for the line emission. Using this technique, we have measured the velocity distribution of the ICM for clusters involving AGN feedback and sloshing of the plasma within the gravitational well (Virgo and Centaurus) and a relaxed one (Ophiuchus). We present a detailed study of the kinematics of the hot ICM for these systems. First, we compute the velocity probability distribution functions (PDFs) from the velocity maps. We find that for all sources the PDF follows a normal distribution, with a hint for a multimodal distribution in the case of Ophiuchus. Then, we compute the velocity structure function (VSF) for all sources in order to study the variation with scale as well as the nature of turbulence in the ICM. We measure a turbulence driving scale of 10-20 kpc for the Virgo cluster, while the Ophiuchus cluster VSF reflects the absence of strong interaction between the ICM and a powerful Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) at such spatial scales. For the former, we compute a dissipation time larger than the jet activity cycle, thus indicating that a more efficient heating process than turbulence is required to reach equilibrium. This is the first time that the VSF of the hot ICM has been computed using direct velocity measurements from X-ray astronomical observations.

  We present, for the first time, dark matter halo (DMH) mass measurement of quasars at $z\sim6$ based on a clustering analysis of 107 quasars. Spectroscopically identified quasars are homogeneously extracted from the HSC-SSP wide layer over $891\,\mathrm{deg^2}$. We evaluate the clustering strength by three different auto-correlation functions: projected correlation function, angular correlation function, and redshift-space correlation function. The DMH mass of quasars at $z\sim6$ is evaluated as $5.0_{-4.0}^{+7.4}\times10^{12}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ with the bias parameter $b=20.8\pm8.7$ by the projected correlation function. The other two estimators agree with these values, though each uncertainty is large. The DMH mass of quasars is found to be nearly constant $\sim10^{12.5}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ throughout cosmic time, suggesting that there is a characteristic DMH mass where quasars are always activated. As a result, quasars appear in the most massive halos at $z \sim 6$, but in less extreme halos thereafter. The DMH mass does not appear to exceed the upper limit of $10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$, which suggests that most quasars reside in DMHs with $M_\mathrm{halo}&lt;10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ across most of the cosmic time. Our results supporting a significant increasing bias with redshift are consistent with the bias evolution model with inefficient AGN feedback at $z\sim6$. The duty cycle ($f_\mathrm{duty}$) is estimated as $0.019\pm0.008$ by assuming that DMHs in some mass interval can host a quasar. The average stellar mass is evaluated from stellar-to-halo mass ratio as $M_*=6.5_{-5.2}^{+9.6}\times10^{10}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$, which is found to be consistent with [C II] observational results.
