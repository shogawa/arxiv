  We present a new iterative deblending method to separate the host galaxy (HG) and their Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission with the use of Integral Field spectroscopic (IFS) data. The method decomposes the resolved HG emission from the unresolved AGN emission by modelling the two-dimensional surface brightness (SB) profile of the point-spread function (PSF) and the two-dimensional SB HG continuum simultaneously per each monochromatic slide. Our method does not require any prior information about the observed SB profile or a detailed fitting of the PSF, making it ideal for the automatic analysis of large galaxy samples. In this work, we test the quality of our method, its advantages, and its disadvantages. We test our method by using a set of IFS mock data cubes to quantify the reliability of our deblending process and further compare our method with the {\sc QDeblend3D} analysis tool. Furthermore, we applied our method to three data cubes selected from the MaNGA survey according to the dominance of either its HG or its AGN. We show that our deblending method is capable of disengaging the bright, nonresolved AGN emission from the HG continuum and its narrow emission lines. However, the decoupling depends on how well the IFS spatially resolves the PSF, and on the relative flux intensity of the HG-AGN. Therefore, the method is ideal for disentangling the bright-flux contribution from AGN-dominated spectra.

  The UV/optical light curves observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are well-characterized by damped random walk (DRW) process, with the damping time $\tau_d$ exhibiting correlations with both the black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and the photon wavelength ($\lambda$). However, the underlying physical origins for the DRW process and the scaling laws remain unclear. We aim to understand the AGN variability induced by a quasi-periodic large-scale dynamo in an accretion disk, and examine whether it reproduces the observed variability features in AGN UV/optical light curves. Using a one-dimensional, optically thick, geometrically thin disk model, we introduce variability into the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ by incorporating quasi-periodic large-scale magnetic fields. With reasonable dynamo parameters, our model successfully reproduces both the linear relation between the root-mean-square and the mean values of the radiation flux, and the log-normal distribution of the flux variability. The PSDs of accretion rates and radiation fluxes align well with DRW models, and yield consistent values of $\tau_d$ with AGN observations. Analytical arguments, supported by numerical evidence, suggest that the flattening of flux PSDs at low frequencies is governed by the timescale at the inner boundary of the emission region for a given wavelength. For $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, variations in the Eddington ratio flatten the $\tau_d$-$M_{BH}$ scaling, resulting in $\tau_d \propto M_{BH}^{0.5-1}$. For $M_{BH} \lesssim 10^6 M_\odot$, we find a steeper scaling, $\tau_d \propto M_{BH}$. Including further refinements, such as the dependence of dynamo properties on $M_{BH}$ and AGN luminosity, and accounting for X-ray reprocessing, would further enhance the accuracy of the model compared to observations.

  We present a detailed analysis of jet activity in the radio galaxy 3C348 at the center of the galaxy cluster Hercules A. We use archival Chandra data to investigate the jet-driven shock front, the radio-faint X-ray cavities, the eastern jet, and the presence of extended Inverse Compton (IC) X-ray emission from the radio lobes. We detect two pairs of shocks: one in the north-south direction at 150 kpc from the center, and another in the east-west direction at 280 kpc. These shocks have Mach numbers of $\mathcal{M} = 1.65\pm0.05$ and $\mathcal{M} = 1.9\pm0.3$, respectively. Together, they form a complete cocoon around the large radio lobes. Based on the distance of the shocks from the center, we estimate that the corresponding jet outburst is 90-150 Myr old. We confirm the presence of two radio-faint cavities within the cocoon, misaligned from the lobes, each $\sim$100 kpc wide and 40-60 Myr old. A backflow from the radio lobes might explain why the cavities are dynamically younger than the cocoon shock front. We also detect non-thermal X-ray emission from the eastern jet and from the large radio lobes. The X-ray emission from the jet is visible at 80 kpc from the AGN and can be accounted for by an IC model with a mild Doppler boosting ($\delta\sim2.7$). A synchrotron model could explain the radio-to-X-ray spectrum only for very high Lorentz factors $\gamma\geq10^{8}$ of the electrons in the jet. For the large radio lobes, we argue that the X-ray emission has an IC origin, with a 1 keV flux density of $21.7\pm1.4\text{(statistical)}\pm1.3\text{(systematic)}$ nJy. A thermal model is unlikely, as it would require unrealistically high gas temperature, density, and pressure, along with a strong depolarization of the radio lobes, which are instead highly polarized. The IC detection, combined with the synchrotron flux density, suggests a magnetic field of $12\pm3\mu$G in the lobes.

  Galaxy mergers represent the most transformative and dramatic avenue for galaxy and supermassive black hole (SMBH) evolution. Multi-active galactic nuclei (multi-AGNs) are expected to ignite, grow, and evolve alongside the host galaxies, and these represent different evolutionary stages of the SMBHs over the merger sequence. However, no comprehensive census exists of observed multi-AGN systems. Here we present The Big Multi-AGN Catalog (The Big MAC), the first literature-complete catalog of all known (confirmed and candidate) multi-AGN systems, which includes dual AGNs (separations $\sim0.03-110$ kpc), binary AGNs (gravitationally bound, $\lesssim30$ pc), recoiling AGNs, and N-tuple AGNs (involving three or more AGNs), gleaned from hundreds of literature articles spanning the years 1970-2020. The Big MAC is the first archive to assemble all multi-AGN systems and candidates across all selection methods, redshifts, and galaxy mass ratios, and this catalog offers a solid foundation for archival and targeted multiwavelength follow-up investigations. In this work, we provide an overview of the creation of the multi-AGN literature library and the catalog itself, present definitions for different multi-AGN classes (including new definitions for dual AGNs derived from galaxy pairs in Illustris-TNG100), describe the general properties of the catalog as a function of redshift space and separation, and we provide a thorough examination of selection and confirmation method usage within the literature. We also discuss best practices for the multi-AGN literature, and we emphasize that a diverse, multiwavelength array of selection approaches is crucial for a complete understanding of multi-AGNs and - by extension - answering long-standing, open questions regarding the importance of AGNs and galaxy mergers.
