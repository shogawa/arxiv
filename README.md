  We investigate the environmental dependence of the gas-phase metallicity for galaxies at $z=0$ to $z\gtrsim 2$ and the underlying physical mechanisms driving this dependence using state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We find that, at fixed stellar mass, central galaxies in massive halos have lower gas-phase metallicity than those in low-mass halos. On the contrary, satellite galaxies residing in more massive halos are more metal-rich. The combined effect is that massive galaxies are more metal-poor in massive halos, and low-mass galaxies are more metal-rich in massive halos. By inspecting the environmental dependence of other galaxy properties, we identify that the accretion of low-metallicity gas is responsible for the environmental dependence of central galaxies at high $z$, whereas the AGN feedback processes play a crucial role at low $z$. For satellite galaxies, we find that both the suppression of gas accretion and the stripping of existing gas are responsible for their environmental dependence, with negligible effect from the AGN feedback. Finally, we show that the difference of gas-phase metallicity as a function of stellar mass between protocluster and field galaxies agrees with recent observational results, for example from the MAMMOTH-Grism survey.

  We aim to unravel the interplay between bars, star formation (SF), and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in barred galaxies. To this end, we utilize the SDSS DR12 to select a sample of nearby (0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.06) disk galaxies that are suitable for bar examination ($M_r &lt; -20.12$ and inclination $\lesssim$ 53$^{\circ}$). We identify 3662 barred galaxies and measure the length and axis ratio of each bar. We invent new bar parameters that mitigate the stellar and bulge mass biases and show, for the first time, that the evolution of non-AGN and AGN-hosting barred galaxies should be tracked using different bar parameters; the bar length for non-AGN galaxies and the bar axis ratio for AGN-hosting galaxies. Our analysis confirms that barred galaxies have a higher specific SF rate than unbarred control galaxies. Moreover, we find a positive correlation of bar length with both the SF enhancement and the centrally star-forming galaxy fraction, indicating the interconnectivity of bars and SF through the bar-driven gas inflow. We also find that while the AGN fraction of barred galaxies is the same as that of the unbarred control sample, galaxies hosting more massive black holes (BHs) have rounder (i.e., higher axis ratio) bars, implying that the bar is not a cause of AGN activity; rather, AGNs appear to regulate bars. Our findings corroborate theoretical predictions that bars in non-AGN galaxies grow in length, and bars in AGN-hosting galaxies become rounder as BHs grow and eventually get destroyed.

  We present the broad-band X-ray spectral analysis (0.6-50 keV) of seven Compton-Thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGN; line-of-sight, l.o.s., column density $&gt;10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) candidates selected from the Swift-BAT 100-month catalog, using archival NuSTAR data. This work is in continuation of the on-going research of the Clemson-INAF group to classify CT-AGN candidates at redshift $z&lt;0.05$, using physically-motivated torus models. Our results confirm that three out of seven targets are \textit{bona-fide} CT-AGN. Adding our results to the previously analysed sources using NuSTAR data, we increase the population of bona-fide CT-AGN by $\sim9\%$, bringing the total number to 35 out of 414 AGN. We also performed a comparative study using MyTorus and borus02 on the spectra in our sample, finding that both physical models are strongly consistent in the parameter space of l.o.s. column density and photon index. Furthermore, the clumpiness of the torus clouds is also investigated by separately computing the line-of-sight and average torus column densities, in each of the seven sources. Adding our results to all the previous 48 CT-AGN candidates analysed by the Clemson-INAF research team having NuSTAR observations: we find $78\%$ of the sources are likely to have a clumpy distribution of the obscuring material surrounding the accreting supermassive black hole.

  We present the analysis of the rest frame ultraviolet and optical spectra of 30 bright blue quasars at $z\sim3$, selected to examine the suitability of AGN as cosmological probes. In our previous works, we found an unexpectedly high fraction ($\approx 25 \%$) of X-ray weak quasars in the sample. The latter sources also display a flatter UV continuum and a broader and fainter CIV profile in the archival UV data with respect to their X-ray normal counterparts. Here we present new observations with the LBT in both the $zJ$ (rest-frame $\simeq$2300-3100 $\rm \mathring{A}$) and the $K_S$ ($\simeq$4750-5350 $\rm \mathring{A}$) bands. We estimated black hole masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) and Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) from the from the H$\beta$ and MgII emission lines, finding that our $z\sim3$ quasars are on average highly accreting ($\langle \lambda_{\rm Edd} \rangle\simeq 1.2$ and $\langle M_{\rm BH} \rangle\simeq 10^{9.7}M_\odot$), with no difference in $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ or $M_{\rm BH}$ between X-ray weak and X-ray normal quasars. From the $zJ$ spectra, we derive flux and equivalent width of MgII and FeII, finding that X-ray weak quasars display higher FeII/MgII ratios with respect to typical quasars. FeII/MgII ratios of X-ray normal quasars are instead consistent with other estimates up to $z\simeq6.5$, corroborating the idea of already chemically mature BLRs at early cosmic time. From the $K_S$ spectra, we find that all the X-ray weak quasars present generally weaker [OIII] emission (EW&lt;10 $\rm \mathring{A}$) than the normal ones. The sample as a whole, however, abides by the known X-ray/[OIII] luminosity correlation, hence the different [OIII] properties are likely due to an intrinsically weaker [OIII] emission in X-ray weak objects, associated to the shape of the spectral energy distribution. We interpret these results in the framework of accretion-disc winds.
