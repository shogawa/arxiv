  We present polarization images from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Giant {Metrewave} Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 5.5, 10 GHz and 663 MHz of the changing-look (CL) AGN, NGC3516. A transverse gradient in the rotation measure (RM) is detected in the northern and southern kpc-scale lobes. Such gradients have typically been suggested to be signatures of a helical magnetic (B-) field. We detect circular polarization in the core and inner jet-knot of this source which is known to host a precessing radio jet interacting with emission-line gas. Soft X-ray emission from the Chandra X-ray Observatory suggests the presence of a hot wind emerging from the nucleus of NGC3516. Taken together with the RM gradient, this presents a picture of jet+wind outflow in this Seyfert galaxy with the B-field confining both the jet and lobe emission. A magnetically driven outflow may in turn cause accretion disk warping and jet precession which is observed in the case of NGC3516.

  We propose a mass-dependent bimodality in the early evolution of galaxies. The massive track connects the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn ($z&gt;8$) to the super-massive quiescent galaxies and black holes (BHs) at cosmic morning ($z=4-7$). The dark-matter halos $&gt;10^{10.5}M_\odot$ at $z=10$ are expected to undergo feedback-free starbursts (FFB) with high star-formation efficiency in dense star clusters within compact galaxies. The less massive halos avoid FFB and form stars gradually under stellar feedback, leading to the peak star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon ($z=1-3$). The FFB and non-FFB halos originate from $&gt;4\sigma$ and $2-3\sigma$ density peaks, respectively. The post-FFB galaxies quench their star formation soon after the FFB phase and remain quiescent due to (a) gas depletion by the FFB starbursts and outflows, (b) compaction events driven by angular-momentum loss in colliding streams within the high-sigma-peak FFB halos, (c) turbulent circum-galactic medium (CGM) that suppresses feeding by cold streams, and (d) BH feedback, being a key for complete quenching. BH feedback is enhanced by FFB-driven BH seeding and growth. It seems capable of disrupting the streams by generating CGM turbulence or photo-heating, but this remains an open challenge. The cosmic-morning quiescent galaxies are expected to be massive, compact, showing signatures of compaction, outflows and AGN, with a comoving number density $\sim 10^{-5} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, comparable to the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn and the AGN at cosmic morning. Their UV luminosity function should peak about $M_{\rm uv} \sim -22$ and contribute $\sim 10\%$ of the galaxies there.

  Galaxy groups are more susceptible to feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5) \times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of $2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation. Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.

  Recent observations have revealed slow, coherent temperature fluctuations in AGN disks that propagate both inward and outward at velocities of $\sim 0.01 - 0.1c$, a kind of variability that is distinct from reverberation (mediated by the reprocessing of light) between different regions of the disk. We investigate the origin and nature of these fluctuations using global 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of radiation and magnetic pressure-dominated AGN accretion disks. Disks with a significant turbulent Maxwell stress component exhibit wave-like temperature perturbations, most evident close to the midplane, whose propagation speeds exactly match the local fast magnetosonic speed and are consistent with the speeds inferred in observations. These fluctuations have amplitudes of $2 - 4\%$ in gas temperature, which are also consistent with observational constraints. Disks that are dominated by mean-field Maxwell stresses do not exhibit such waves. While waves may be present in the body of the disk, we do not find them to be present in the photosphere. Although this may in part be due to low numerical resolution in the photosphere region, we discuss the physical challenges that must be overcome for the waves to manifest there. In particular, the fact that such waves are observed implies that the disk photospheres must be magnetically dominated, since radiative damping from photon diffusion smooths out radiation pressure fluctuations. Furthermore, the gas and radiation fluctuations must be out of local thermodynamic equilibrium.
