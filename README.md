  Ultra-steep spectrum (USS) radio sources with complex filamentary morphologies are a poorly understood subclass of diffuse radio source found in galaxy clusters. They are characterised by power law spectra with spectral indices less than -1.5, and are typically located in merging clusters. We present X-ray and radio observations of the galaxy cluster A272, containing a USS diffuse radio source. The system is an ongoing major cluster merger with an extended region of bright X-ray emission south of the core. Surface brightness analysis yields a $3\sigma$ detection of a merger shock front in this region. We obtain shock Mach numbers $M_\rho = 1.20 \pm 0.09$ and $M_T = 1.7 \pm 0.3$ from the density and temperature jumps, respectively. Optical data reveals that the system is a merger between a northern cool core cluster and a southern non-cool core cluster. We find that the USS source, with spectral index $\alpha^{\text{74 MHz}}_{\text{1.4 GHz}} = -1.9 \pm 0.1$, is located in the bright southern region. Radio observations show that the source has a double-lobed structure with complex filaments, and is centred on the brightest cluster galaxy of the southern subcluster. We provide two suggestions for the origin of this source; the first posits the source as an AGN relic that has been re-energised by the passing of a merger shock front, while the second interprets the complex structure as the result of two overlapping AGN radio outbursts. We also present constraints on the inverse Compton emission at the location of the source.

  In this letter, motivated by double-peaked broad Balmer emission lines probably related to tidal disruption events (TDEs), a potential TDE candidate is reported in SDSS J160536+134838 (=SDSS J1605) at $z\sim0.44$ having quasar-like spectrum but with double-peaked broad H$\beta$. The long-term CSS light curve can be naturally described by a main-sequence star of $2.82_{-0.19}^{+0.20}{\rm M_\odot}$ disrupted by the central black hole (BH) of $144_{-21}^{+26}\times10^6{\rm M_\odot}$ in SDSS J1605. Meanwhile, the ASAS-SN light curves afterwards show none apparent trend variability, indicating the bright CSS flare in SDSS J1605 unique and different enough from variability of normal AGN. Furthermore, there is a consistency between the TDE model determined sizes of debris with the sizes of emission regions for the double-peaked broad H$\beta$ described by the accretion disk model, supporting the disk-like BLRs probably related to a central TDE in SDSS J1605. And the virial BH mass $\sim$7 times higher than the TDE model determined value can be naturally explained by R-L relation determined BLRs sizes very larger than the actual distance of emission regions related to TDEs debris in SDSS J1605. Although no clear conclusion on double-peaked broad lines absolutely related to TDEs, the results here provide clues to detect potential TDEs in AGN with double-peaked broad lines.

  In a previous paper, we reported evidence for quasi-periodicities in the \textsl{TESS} light curves of BL Lacerate and two other blazars found serendipitously in the SDSS AGN catalog. In this work, we find tentative evidence for quasi-periodic features in the \textsl{TESS} observations of five sources in the fourth catalog of the Fermi--LAT (4FGL) sources: J090453.4$-$573503, J2345$-$1555, B0422+004, J002159.2$-$514028, and B0537$-$441. We analysed the \textsl{TESS} light curves of these blazars that we extracted using a customized approach. The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are searched for using two timing analysis techniques: generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet Z-transform. Their apparent periods lie in the range of 2.8--6.5 days and have at least 3$\sigma$ significance in both of these methods. QPOs at such timescales can originate from the kink instability model which relates the quasi-periodic feature with the growth of kinks in the magnetized relativistic jets. We performed MCMC simulations to obtain the posterior distribution of parameters associated with this model and found the kink period consistent with previous studies.
