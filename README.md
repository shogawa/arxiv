We measure the Eddington ratio distribution of local optical narrow line active galactic nuclei (AGN) as a function of host galaxy properties, as a potential test of supermassive black hole growth and feedback models in galaxy formation theory. We base our sample on integral field spectroscopy from the MaNGA data in SDSS-IV's DR17. Starting with MaNGA's calibrated row-stacked spectra, we produce new spectroscopic data cubes with minimal covariance between spaxels and higher resolution point spread functions (PSF), and then extract line fluxes for the central PSF. Using the line ratio diagnostic techniques of Ji &amp; Yan (2020), we identify AGN galaxies and determine their H$β$ and [O III] line luminosities. For all galaxies not identified as AGN, we determine the threshold line luminosity they would have needed to be identified as AGN. These luminosity thresholds are essential to determine, because many star forming galaxies likely host AGN of significant luminosity that are unidentified because they are outshone by star formation related emission. We show that ignoring these selection effects when measuring the Eddington ratio distribution would lead to biased results. From the H$β$ luminosities and luminosity detection thresholds, accounting for selection effects, we measure the luminosity and Eddington ratio distributions of Seyferts as a function of specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass. Defining $F_{\rm AGN}$ as the occurrence rate of AGN above a fixed Eddington ratio of $10^{-3}$, we find that $F_{\rm AGN}$ is constant or increasing with stellar mass for star forming galaxies and declines strongly with stellar mass for quiescent galaxies. At stellar masses $\log_{10} M_\ast &gt; 10.25$, the occurrence rate increases monotonically with sSFR. These patterns reveal a complicated dependence of AGN activity on galaxy properties for theoretical models to explain.

Observational evidence regarding the impact of AGN feedback on star formation (SF) in non-jetted galaxies is limited. With the available high-resolution UV observations from AstroSat-UVIT, complemented by GALEX, we studied the SF properties in the outskirts ($&gt;0.5R_{25}$) of six AGN-host galaxies and compared them with four non-AGN galaxies of similar morphology. We observed a higher SF rate density ($Σ_{\text{SFR}}$) for the UV knots in AGN-host galaxies, and it falls off less rapidly compared to non-AGN galaxies, suggesting positive AGN feedback in the outskirts of AGN-host galaxies. Additionally, FUV attenuation (A$_{\text{FUV}}$) is also enhanced in the outer regions and falls less rapidly in AGN-host compared to non-AGN, indicating that the feedback could be coupled with dust. We speculate that the radiation-pressure-driven and/or wind mode AGN feedback could be at play even in low-luminosity nearby AGN-host galaxies.

High-resolution AstroSat-UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) observations revealed a knot of UV emission, $\sim 1.7$ kpc away from the centre of NGC 315, a nearby elliptical galaxy hosting a giant (Mpc scale) radio source with a jet. We suggest that this patchy and spatially extended UV emission is likely due to ongoing star formation (SF) in the galaxy. The estimated SF rate (SFR) averaged over 100 Myr for the UV knot ($0.23\pm0.10$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is significantly higher compared to a typical elliptical galaxy. As the galaxy does not show the signatures of recent major mergers, the possible mechanisms for the triggered SF include AGN feedback or minor mergers. Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) observations reveal dust filaments that extend through a UV knot. The origin of dusty filaments, though not clear, could be associated with gas clouds as a result of a minor merger, cooled gas falling into the central BCG and/or condensing of the gas uplifted by AGN jet. No significant clumpy UV emission is observed in other regions along the dust filament. We speculate that mechanical feedback from the AGN jet could be playing a role in triggering SF in the UV knot.

We use the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1) to investigate the contributions of AGN and extended gas to the total X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) of galaxy groups with different halo masses ($M_h$) at different redshifts. The presence of AGN in their central galaxies is identified using multi-wavelength catalogs, including the X-ray counterparts, the ASKAP radio catalog, and the DESI spectroscopic measurements. We apply the stacking method to obtain sufficient statistics for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the $L_X$ for groups with different central AGN properties. We find that the X-ray groups exhibit the highest $L_X$, followed by groups with QSO, radio, BPT-AGN, and non-AGN centrals. Moreover, the $L_X$ of the $M_h \lesssim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ groups is dominated by the central AGN, while the X-ray emission from extended gas tends to be more prominent in the $M_h \gtrsim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ groups. In groups where the AGN play a major role in X-ray emission, the contribution from extended gas is minor, resulting in significant uncertainties concerning the extended X-ray emission. When the subset containing the X-ray detected counterparts is excluded, the extended gas component becomes easier to obtain. A correlation has been identified between the X-ray luminosity of the central AGN and extended gas. However, once we account for the positional offset, their correlation becomes less prominent. Currently, the results are not conclusive enough to confirm whether there is a connection between the AGN feedback and extended gas. However, they provide a new perspective on the feedback processes in the history of group assembly.

Ultra Fast Outflows (UFOs) are powerful, highly ionized winds launched from the innermost regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), reaching velocities of 0.03 -- 0.3 c and playing a key role in AGN feedback. We present a photoionization analysis of an 18 ks \xmm\ snapshot of the Seyfert 1 AGN Mrk 877, revealing three distinct UFO components with line-of-sight velocities of $0.10^{+0.005}_{-0.005}~c$ , $ 0.04^{+0.005}_{-0.004}~c$ , and $0.05^{+0.005}_{-0.004}~c$. These components span a broad range of ionization parameters and column densities, producing absorption features across both soft and hard X-ray bands. Even under the most conservative assumption for the volume filling factor, the fastest component exceeds $5\%$ of the Eddington luminosity, making it capable of driving strong galaxy-scale feedback. The soft X-ray UFO component, despite its lower ionization, shares a similar velocity as a higher-ionization component, hinting at a two-phase medium likely shaped by clumpiness or interactions with ambient material. The density profile inferred from the Absorption Measurement Distributions (AMD) and the positive trend between outflow momentum rate and radiation momentum flux suggest that wind is powered by a combination of radiative and magnetic driving.

Infrared-luminous galaxies are important sites of stellar and black hole mass assembly at most redshifts. Their luminosities are often estimated by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to near- to far-infrared data, but the dependence of these estimates on the data used is not well-understood. Here, using observations simulated from a well-studied local sample, we compare the effects of wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise (S/N), flux calibration, angular resolution, and redshift on the recovery of starburst, AGN, and host luminosities. We show that the most important factors are wavelength coverage that spans the peak in a SED, with dense wavelength sampling. Such observations recover starburst and AGN infrared luminosities with systematic bias below $20\%$. Starburst luminosities are best recovered with far-infrared observations while AGN luminosities are best recovered with near- and mid-infrared observations, though the recovery of both are enhanced with near/mid-infrared, and far-infrared observations, respectively. Host luminosities are best recovered with near/far-infrared observations, but are usually biased low, by $\gtrsim20\%$. The recovery of starburst and AGN luminosity is enhanced by observing at high angular resolution. Starburst-dominated systems show more biased recovery of luminosities than do AGN-dominated systems. As redshift increases, far-infrared observations become more capable, and mid-infrared observations less capable, at recovering luminosities. Our results highlight the transformative power of a far-infrared instrument with dense wavelength coverage from tens to hundreds of microns for studying infrared-luminous galaxies. We tabulate estimates of systematic bias and random error for use with JWST and other observatories.

We investigate how the obscured IR-derived and the dust-corrected UV star formation rate functions (SFRFs) compare with each other, and with predictions from state-of-the-art theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. We derive the IR-SFRF from the ALMA A$^3$COSMOS survey, by converting the IR luminosity functions (IR-LFs) into SFRF after correcting for AGN contribution. Similarly, we obtain the UV SFRFs from literature UV LFs, corrected for dust-extinction. First, we fit the two SFRFs independently via a MCMC approach, then we combine them to obtain the first estimate of the total SFRF out to $z \sim 6$. Finally, we compare this SFRF with the predictions of a set of theoretical models. We derived the UV (dust-extinction corrected, from literature UV-LFs) and IR SFRFs (from Herschel and ALMA IR-LFs) at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 6$ , finding that they are mostly complementary, covering different ranges in star formation rate (SFR$ &lt; 10-100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the UV-corrected and SFR$ &gt; 100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the IR). From the comparison of the total SFRF with model predictions we find an overall good agreement at $z &lt; 2.5$, with increasing difference at higher redshifts, with all models missing the galaxies that are forming stars with the highest SFRs. We finally obtained the UV (dust-corrected), IR and total star formation rate densities (SFRDs), finding that there are no redshift ranges where UV and IR alone are able to reproduce the whole total SFRD.

To examine how AGN feedback shapes the intracluster medium (ICM) and fuels black hole accretion in the cool-core galaxy cluster Abell 2597, we present deep ($\sim$600 ks) Chandra X-ray observations complemented by archival GMRT radio and SINFONI near-infrared data. Radio-mode AGN activity has inflated seven X-ray cavities and driven one to three potential weak shocks ($M \sim 1.05-1.14$) extending to $\sim 150$ kpc, suggesting recurrent outbursts occurring on $\sim 10^7$ year timescales. We also detect a narrow, $\sim$57 kpc X-ray surface brightness deficit-a potential plasma depletion layer-likely shaped by residual sloshing motions that amplified magnetic fields and/or displaced gas within the cluster core. Although the AGN injects $\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ of energy, comparable to the cluster's cooling luminosity, radiative cooling persists at $\sim$15 M$_{\odot} $yr$^{-1}$, replenishing the billion solar mass cold gas reservoir at the heart of the brightest cluster galaxy. Sustaining this level of activity requires a continuous fuel supply, yet the estimated Bondi accretion power ($\sim 2 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) falls an order of magnitude short of the observed cavity power, suggesting that "hot" gas fueling is insufficient. Instead, archival ALMA observations continue to support a chaotic cold accretion scenario, where turbulence-driven condensation fuels the AGN at rates exceeding Bondi accretion, sustaining a self-regulated feedback cycle that repeatedly shapes the core of Abell 2597.

Strongly lensed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with an observable time delay can be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe through time-delay cosmography (TDC). As the sample of time-delay lenses grows to statistical size, with $\mathcal{O}$(1000) lensed AGN forecast to be observed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM.

We present JWST observations of the radio galaxy TGSSJ1530+1049, spectroscopically confirmed at $z=4.0$. NIRCam images and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy ($R=2700$) show that TGSSJ1530+1049 is part of one of the densest-known structures of continuum and line-emitting objects found at these redshifts. NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc^2 area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log($M_\star/M_\odot)&gt;10.3$) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of $\approx10^{13} M_\odot$. Based on the physical separations and velocity differences between the galaxies, it is expected that these galaxies will merge to form a massive galaxy within a few Gyr. The system qualitatively resembles the forming brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations that form early through a rapid succession of mergers.
