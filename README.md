  We present an imaging molecular line survey in the 3-mm band (85-114 GHz) focused on one of the nearest galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN), NGC 1068, based on observations taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Distributions of 23 molecular transitions are obtained in the central ~3 kpc region, including both the circumnuclear disk (CND) and starburst ring (SBR) with 60 and 350 pc resolution. The column densities and relative abundances of all the detected molecules are estimated under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium in the CND and SBR. Then, we discuss the physical and chemical effects of the AGN on molecular abundance corresponding to the observation scale. We found that H13CN, SiO, HCN, and H13CO+ are abundant in the CND relative to the SBR. In contrast, 13CO is more abundant in the SBR. Based on the calculated column density ratios of N(HCN)/N(HCO+), N(HCN)/N(CN), and other molecular distributions, we conclude that the enhancement of HCN in the CND may be due to high-temperature environments resulting from strong shocks, which are traced by the SiO emission. Moreover, the abundance of CN in the CND is significantly lower than the expected value of the model calculations in the region affected by strong radiation. The expected strong X-ray irradiation from the AGN has a relatively lower impact on the molecular abundance in the CND than mechanical feedback.

  Studying the feedback process of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) requires characterising multiple kinematical components, such as rotating gas and stellar disks, outflows, inflows, and jets. To compare the observed properties with theoretical predictions of galaxy evolution and feedback models and to assess the mutual interaction and energy injection rate into the interstellar medium (ISM), one usually relies on simplified kinematic models. These models have several limitations, as they often do not take into account projection effects, beam smearing and the surface brightness distribution of the emitting medium. Here, we present MOKA3D, an innovative approach to model the 3D gas kinematics from integral field spectroscopy observations. In this first paper, we discuss its application to the case of AGN ionised outflows, whose observed clumpy emission and apparently irregular kinematics are only marginally accounted for by existing kinematical models. Unlike previous works, our model does not assume the surface brightness distribution of the gas, but exploits a novel procedure to derive it from the observations by reconstructing the 3D distribution of emitting clouds and providing accurate estimates of the spatially resolved outflow physical properties (e.g. mass rate, kinetic energy). As an example, we demonstrate the capabilities of our method by applying it to three nearby Seyfert-II galaxies observed with MUSE at the VLT and selected from the MAGNUM survey, showing that the complex kinematic features observed can be described by a conical outflow with a constant radial velocity field and a clumpy distribution of clouds.

  Using the SWIFT simulation code we study different forms of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in idealized galaxy groups and clusters. We first present a physically motivated model of black hole (BH) spin evolution and a numerical implementation of thermal isotropic feedback (representing the effects of energy-driven winds) and collimated kinetic jets that they launch at different accretion rates. We find that kinetic jet feedback is more efficient at quenching star formation in the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) than thermal isotropic feedback, while simultaneously yielding cooler cores in the intracluster medium (ICM). A hybrid model with both types of AGN feedback yields moderate star formation rates, while having the coolest cores. We then consider a simplified implementation of AGN feedback by fixing the feedback efficiencies and the jet direction, finding that the same general conclusions hold. We vary the feedback energetics (the kick velocity and the heating temperature), the fixed efficiencies and the type of energy (kinetic versus thermal) in both the isotropic and the jet case. The isotropic case is largely insensitive to these variations. In particular, we highlight that kinetic isotropic feedback (used e.g. in IllustrisTNG) is similar in its effects to its thermal counterpart (used e.g. in EAGLE). On the other hand, jet feedback must be kinetic in order to be efficient at quenching. We also find that it is much more sensitive to the choice of energy per feedback event (the jet velocity), as well as the efficiency. The former indicates that jet velocities need to be carefully chosen in cosmological simulations, while the latter motivates the use of BH spin evolution models.

  The detection of gravitational waves (GW) with an electromagnetic counterpart enabled the first Hubble Constant $H_0$ measurement through the standard siren method. Current constraints suggest that $\sim 20-80\%$ of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) Binary Black Hole (BBH) mergers occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks. The claim for a possible association of several BBH mergers with flaring AGNs suggests that cosmological analyses using BBH and AGNs might be promising. We explore standard siren analyses through a method that takes into account the presence of background flaring AGNs, without requiring a unique host galaxy identification, and apply it to realistic GW simulations. Depending on the fraction of LVK BBHs that induce flares, we expect to constrain $H_0$ at the $\sim 3.5-7\%$ ($\sim 2.5-5\%$) precision with $\sim 2$ years or $\sim 160$ events ($\sim 1$ year or $500$ events) of LVK at design (A+) sensitivity, assuming that systematic BBH follow-up searches are performed. Assuming a more restrictive $\Omega_{\rm m}$ prior and that at least $20\%$ of BBHs produces detectable flares, we may reach a $3\%$ ($2\%$) precision in $H_0$ after 2 (1) year of LVK at design (A+) sensitivity. We also show that a $\sim 5-10\%$ precision is possible with complete AGN catalogs and 1 year of LVK run, without the need of time-critical follow-up observations.

  We look for simulated star-forming linear wakes such as the one recently discovered by van Dokkum et al. (2023) in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation ASTRID. Amongst the runaway black holes in ASTRID, none are able to produce clear star-forming wakes. Meanwhile, fly-by encounters, typically involving a compact galaxy (with a central black hole) and a star-forming galaxy (with a duo of black holes) reproduce remarkably well many of the key properties (its length and linearity; recent star formation, etc.) of the observed star-forming linear feature. We predict the feature to persist for approximately 100 Myr in such a system and hence constitute a rare event. The feature contains a partly stripped galaxy (with $M_{\rm gal}=10^9 \sim 10^{10}M_\odot$) and a dual BH system ($M_{\rm BH}=10^5 \sim 10^7\,M_\odot$) in its brightest knot. X-ray emission from AGN in the knot should be detectable in such systems. After $100\sim 200\,{\rm Myrs}$ from the first fly-by, the galaxies merge leaving behind a triple black hole system in a (still) actively star-forming early-type remnant of mass $\sim 5\times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$. Follow-up JWST observations may be key for revealing the nature of these linear features by potentially detecting the older stellar populations constituting the bright knot. Confirmation of such detections may therefore help discriminate a fly-by encounter from a massive BH wake to reveal the origin of such features.

  The hot, X-ray-emitting phase of the circumgalactic medium in galaxies is believed to be the reservoir of baryons from which gas flows onto the central galaxy and into which feedback from AGN and stars inject mass, momentum, energy, and metals. These effects shape the velocity fields of the hot gas, which can be observed by X-ray IFUs via the Doppler shifting and broadening of emission lines. In this work, we analyze the gas kinematics of the hot circumgalactic medium of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies from the TNG50 simulation with synthetic observations to determine how future instruments can probe this velocity structure. We find that the hot phase is often characterized by outflows outward from the disk driven by feedback processes, radial inflows near the galactic plane, and rotation, though in other cases the velocity field is more disorganized and turbulent. With a spectral resolution of $\sim$1 eV, fast and hot outflows ($\sim$200-500 km s$^{-1}$) can be measured, depending on the orientation of the galaxy on the sky. The rotation velocity of the hot phase ($\sim$100-200 km s$^{-1}$) can be measured using line shifts in edge-on galaxies, and is slower than that of colder gas phases but similar to stellar rotation velocities. By contrast, the slow inflows ($\sim$50-100 km s$^{-1}$) are difficult to measure in projection with these other components. We find that the velocity measured is sensitive to which emission lines are used. Measuring these flows will help constrain theories of how the gas in these galaxies forms and evolves.

  We present the first results from the Revealing Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (ReveaLLAGN) survey, a JWST survey of seven nearby LLAGN. We focus on two observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument's (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) of the nuclei of NGC 1052 and Sombrero (NGC 4594 / M104). We also compare these data to public JWST data of a higher-luminosity AGN, NGC 7319. JWST clearly resolves the AGN component even in Sombrero, the faintest target in our survey; the AGN components have very red spectra. We find that the emission-line widths in both NGC 1052 and Sombrero increase with increasing ionization potential, with FWHM &gt; 1000 km/s for lines with ionization potential &gt; 50 eV. These lines are also significantly blue-shifted in both LLAGN. The high ionization potential lines in NGC 7319 show neither broad widths or significant blue shifts. Many of the lower ionization potential emission lines in Sombrero show significant blue wings extending &gt; 1000 km/s. These features and the emission-line maps in both galaxies are consistent with outflows along the jet direction. Sombrero has the lowest luminosity high-ionization potential lines ([Ne V] and [O IV]) ever measured in the mid-IR, but the relative strengths of these lines are consistent with higher luminosity AGN. On the other hand, the [Ne V] emission is much weaker relative to the [Ne III}] and [Ne II] lines of higher-luminosity AGN. These initial results show the great promise that JWST holds for identifying and studying the physical nature of LLAGN.

  The Astro2020 Decadal Survey has identified the mapping of the circumgalactic medium (CGM, gaseous plasma around galaxies) as a key objective. We explore the prospects for characterizing the CGM in and around nearby galaxy halos with future large grasp X-ray microcalorimeters. We create realistic mock observations from hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba) that demonstrate a wide range of potential measurements, which will address the open questions in galaxy formation and evolution. By including all background and foreground components in our mock observations, we show why it is impossible to perform these measurements with current instruments, such as X-ray CCDs, and only microcalorimeters will allow us to distinguish the faint CGM emission from the bright Milky Way (MW) foreground emission lines.   We find that individual halos of MW mass can, on average, be traced out to large radii, around R500, and for larger galaxies even out to R200, using the OVII, OVIII, or FeXVII emission lines. Furthermore, we show that emission line ratios for individual halos can reveal the radial temperature structure. Substructure measurements show that it will be possible to relate azimuthal variations to the feedback mode of the galaxy. We demonstrate the ability to construct temperature, velocity, and abundance ratio maps from spectral fitting for individual galaxy halos, which reveal rotation features, AGN outbursts, and enrichment.
