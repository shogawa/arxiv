  The aim of this study is to identify quiescent galaxies in the 2-deg$^2$ COSMOS field at $z \sim 3.1$ and analyze their environment. Using data from the ODIN survey and COSMOS2020 catalog, we identify 24 massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) with stellar masses $\geq 10^{10.6}$ and derive their star formation histories and quenching timescales using SED fitting with BAGPIPES. Voronoi-based density maps trace local and large-scale environments using Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters and photometric galaxies. Results indicate uniformly short quenching timescales ($&lt;$500 Myr) independent of environmental density, suggesting rapid internal mechanisms such as AGN feedback dominate over environmental factors. MQGs do not correlate with protoclusters or filaments, although some are near gas-rich filaments but show no rejuvenation. These findings suggest quenching at high redshift is driven primarily by internal processes rather than environmental interactions.

  Around 50 years ago, the famous bet between Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne on whether Cyg X-1 hosts a stellar-mass black hole became a well-known story in the history of black hole science. Today, Cyg X-1 is widely recognised as hosting a stellar-mass black hole with a mass of approximately 20 solar masses. With the advancement of X-ray telescopes, Cyg X-1 has become a prime laboratory for studies in stellar evolution, accretion physics, and high-energy plasma physics. In this review, we explore the latest results from X-ray observations of Cyg X-1, focusing on its implications for black hole spin, its role in stellar evolution, the geometry of the innermost accretion regions, and the plasma physics insights derived from its X-ray emissions. This review primarily focuses on Cyg X-1; however, the underlying physics applies to other black hole X-ray binaries and, to some extent, to AGNs.

  Understanding the processes that drive the morphology and kinematics of molecular gas in galaxies is crucial for comprehending star formation and, ultimately, galaxy evolution. Using data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we study the behavior of the warm molecular gas at temperatures of hundreds of Kelvin and the cold molecular gas at tens of Kelvin in the galaxy MCG$-$05$-$23$-$16, which hosts an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of this spheroidal galaxy, classified in the optical as S0, show a dust lane resembling a nuclear spiral and a surrounding ring. These features are also detected in CO(2$-$1) and H2, and their morphologies and kinematics are consistent with rotation plus local inward gas motions along the kinematic minor axis in the presence of a nuclear bar. The H2 transitions 0-0 S(3), 0-0 S(4), and 0-0 S(5), which trace warmer and more excited gas, show more disrupted kinematics than 0-0 S(1) and 0-0 S(2), including clumps of high-velocity dispersion (of up to $\sim$ 160 km/s), in regions devoid of CO(2$-$1). The kinematics of one of these clumps, located at $\sim$ 350 pc westward from the nucleus, are consistent with outflowing gas, possibly driven by localized star formation traced by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 11.3 ${\mu}$m. Overall, we observe a stratification of the molecular gas, with the colder gas located in the nuclear spiral, ring, and connecting arms, while most warmer gas with higher velocity-dispersion fills the inter-arm space. The compact jet, approximately 200 pc in size, detected with Very Large Array (VLA) observations, does not appear to significantly affect the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas, possibly due to its limited intersection with the molecular gas disc.

  We obtain CO(1-0) molecular gas measurements with ATCA on a sample of 43 spectroscopically confirmed H$\alpha$ emitters in the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$ and investigate the relation between their star formation and cold gas reservoirs as a function of environment. We achieve a CO(1-0) detection rate of $\sim23\pm12\%$ with 10 dual CO(1-0) and H$\alpha$ detections at $10&lt;\log M_{*}/M_\odot&lt;11.5$. In addition, we obtain upper limits for the remaining sources. In terms of total gas fractions ($F_{gas}$), our sample is divided into two different regimes with a steep transition at $\log M_{*}/M_\odot\approx10.5$. Galaxies below that threshold have gas fractions that in some cases are close to unity, indicating that their gas reservoir has been replenished by inflows from the cosmic web. However, objects at $\log M_{*}/M_\odot&gt;10.5$ display significantly lower gas fractions and are dominated by AGN (12 out of 20). Stacking results yield $F_{gas}\approx0.55$ for massive emitters excluding AGN, and $F_{gas}\approx0.35$ when examining only AGN candidates. Furthermore, depletion times show that most H$\alpha$ emitters may become passive by $1&lt;z&lt;1.6$, concurrently with the surge and dominance of the red sequence in the most massive clusters. Our analyses suggest that galaxies in the outskirts of the protocluster have larger molecular-to-stellar mass ratios and lower star formation efficiencies than in the core. However, star formation across the protocluster remains consistent with the main sequence, indicating that evolution is primarily driven by the depletion of the gas reservoir towards the inner regions. We discuss the relative importance of in-/outflow processes in regulating star formation during the early phases of cluster assembly and conclude that a combination of feedback and overconsumption may be responsible for the rapid cold gas depletion these objects endure.

  JWST has revealed a large population of compact, red galaxies at $z&gt;4$ known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). We analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 95 LRDs from the JWST PRIMER survey with complete photometric coverage from $1-18\ \mu$m using NIRCam and MIRI imaging, representing the most extensive SED analysis on a large LRD sample with long-wavelength MIRI data. We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario's implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low-mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN-only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning $\sim$2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The black hole and stellar masses inferred from the hybrid model lead to highly overmassive black holes even exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super-Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN or galaxy dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.
