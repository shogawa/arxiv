  We present statistics of $z\sim 6-9$ galaxy outflows indicated by spatially-extended gas emission and broad lines. With a total of 61 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $z\sim 6-9$ in the JWST CEERS, GLASS, and ERO data, we find five galaxies with [O{\sc iii}]+H$\beta$ ionized gas emission significantly extended beyond the kpc-scale stellar components on the basis of the emission line images constructed by the subtraction of NIRCam broadband (line on/off-band) images. By comparison with low-$z$ galaxies, the fraction of galaxies with the spatially extended gas, 5/61, at $z\sim 6-9$ is an order of magnitude higher than those at $z\sim 0-1$, which can be explained by events triggered by frequent major mergers at high redshift. We also investigate medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec spectra of 30 galaxies at $z\sim 6-9$, and identify five galaxies with broad ($140-800$~km~s$^{-1}$) lines in the [O{\sc iii}] forbidden line emission, suggestive of galaxy outflows. One galaxy at $z=6.38$ shows both the spatially-extended gas emission and the broad lines, while none of the galaxies with the spatially-extended gas emission or broad lines present a clear signature of AGN either in the line diagnostics or Type 1 AGN line broadening ($&gt;1000$~km~s$^{-1}$), which hint outflows mainly driven by stellar feedback. The existence of galaxies with/without spatially-extended gas emission or broad lines may suggest that these are galaxies in the early, late, post phases of galaxy outflows at high redshift, where the relatively large fractions of such galaxies indicate the longer-duration and/or more-frequent outflows at the early cosmic epoch.

  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our knowledge of $z&gt;5$ galaxies and their actively accreting black holes. Using the JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) in the lensing field Abell 2744, we report the identification of a sample of little red dots at $3 &lt; z_{\rm{phot}} &lt; 7$ that likely contain highly-reddened accreting supermassive black holes. Using a NIRCam-only selection to F444W$&lt;27.7$ mag, we find 26 sources over the $\sim45$ arcmin$^{2}$ field that are blue in F115W$-$F200W$\sim0$ (or $\beta_{\rm UV}\sim-2.0$ for $f_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^\beta$), red in F200W$-$F444W = $1-4$ ($\beta_{\rm opt} \sim +2.0$), and are dominated by a point-source like central component. Of the 20 sources with deep ALMA 1.2-mm coverage, none are detected individually or in a stack. For the majority of the sample, SED fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models with hot dust rather than obscured star-formation to reproduce the red NIRCam colors and ALMA 1.2-mm non-detections. While compact dusty star formation can not be ruled out, the combination of extremely small sizes ($\langle r_e \rangle\approx50$ pc after correction for magnification), red rest-frame optical slopes, and hot dust can by explained by reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our targets have faint $M_{\rm 1450} \approx -14\ \, {\rm to} -18$ mag but inferred bolometric luminosities of $L_{\rm bol} = 10^{43}-10^{46}$ erg/s, reflecting their obscured nature. If the candidates are confirmed as AGNs with upcoming UNCOVER spectroscopy, then we have found an abundant population of reddened luminous AGN that are at least ten times more numerous than UV-luminous AGN at the same intrinsic bolometric luminosity.

  In this work, we use hydrodynamical simulations to explore the effects of kinetic AGN jet feedback on the progression and outcome of the major merger of two isolated, gas-rich galaxies. We present simulations that use the moving-mesh code AREPO to follow the progression of the merger through first passage and up to the final coalescence, modelling the black holes at the centres of both of the merging galaxies using our prescription for black hole accretion via an $\alpha$-disc and feedback in the form of a spin-driven jet. We find that the jets drive large-scale, multiphase outflows which launch large quantities of cold gas out to distances greater than 100 kpc and with velocities that reach $\sim 2500 \, {\rm km \, s^{-1}}$. Gas in the outflows that decelerates, cools and falls back on the galaxies can provide a rich source of fuel for the black hole, leading to intense episodes of jet activity in which the jet can become significantly misaligned. The presence of AGN jets affects the growth of the stellar component: star formation is moderately suppressed at all times during the merger and the peak of the star formation rate, attained during the final coalescence of the galaxies, is reduced by a factor of $\sim 2$. Analysis of simulations such as these will play a central role in making precise predictions for multimessenger investigations of dual radio-AGN, which next-generation observational facilities such as LISA, Athena and SKA will make possible.
