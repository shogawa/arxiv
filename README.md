  An increasing number of observations and simulations suggests that low-power (&lt;10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) jets may be a significant channel of feedback produced by active galactic nuclei (AGN), but little is known about their actual effect on their host galaxies from the observational point of view. We targeted four luminous type 2 AGN hosting moderately powerful radio emission ($\sim$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), two of which and possibly a third are associated with jets, with optical integral field spectroscopy observations from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to analyze the properties of their ionized gas as well as the properties and effects of ionized outflows. We combined these observations with Very Large Array (VLA) and e-MERLIN data to investigate the relations and interactions between the radio jets and host galaxies. We detected ionized outflows as traced by the fast bulk motion of the gas. The outflows extended over kiloparsec scales in the direction of the jet, when present. In the two sources with resolved radio jets, we detected a strong enhancement in the emission-line velocity dispersion (up to 1000 km s$^{-1}$) perpendicular to the direction of the radio jets. We also found a correlation between the mass and the energetics of this high-velocity dispersion gas and the radio power, which supports the idea that the radio emission may cause the enhanced turbulence. This phenomenon, which is now being observed in an increasing number of objects, might represent an important channel for AGN feedback on galaxies.

  We present a study on stellar properties of Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emitters at 5 $&lt; z &lt;$ 8.2. We use 247 photometrically-selected, lensed, high-redshift, low luminosity galaxy candidates with spectroscopic follow-up. Of these, 38 are confirmed spectroscopically to be between 5 $&lt; z &lt;$ 8.2 via detection of Ly$\alpha$. For each galaxy and candidate, we estimate stellar mass, star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and mass-weighted age with spectral energy distribution fitting. We also measure the UV $\beta$ slope and luminosity using values from photometry. We find no strong correlation between Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width and any of these properties, as well as no significant difference between the physical properties of Ly$\alpha$ emitters and candidates without Ly$\alpha$ detected. This lack of expected trends may be explained by a combination of the evolving opacity of the IGM at these redshifts as well as the unique phase space probed by our lensed sample. Via tests on other galaxy samples which show varying strengths of correlations, we conclude that if there exist any relationships between Ly$\alpha$ EW and physical properties in the underlying population of faint galaxies, they are weak correlations. We also present the results of a spectroscopic search for CIII] emission in confirmed Ly$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 7$, finding no CIII] detections, but putting constraints on strong AGN activity and extreme nebular emission.

  We report on a study of the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line and reflection spectrum in the well-known Seyfert-2 AGN, NGC 4388. X-ray spectra summed from two extensive NICER monitoring campaigns, separated by years, show strong evidence of variation in the direct continuum and reflected emission, but only small variations in the obscuring gas. Fits to the spectra from individual NICER observations find a strong, positive correlation between the power-law photon index, $\Gamma$, and direct flux that is commonly observed in unobscured AGN. A search for a reverberation lag between the direct and reflected spectra -- dominated by the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ emission line -- measures a time scale of $t = 16.37^{+0.46}_{-0.38}$ days, or a characteristic radius of $r=1.374_{-0.032}^{+0.039}\times10^{-2}$ pc $=3.4_{-0.1}^{+0.1}\times10^4\;GM/c^2$. Only one cycle of this tentative lag is observed, but it is driven by a particularly sharp drop in the direct continuum that leads to the subsequent disappearance of the otherwise prominent Fe K$\alpha$ line. Physically motivated fits to high-resolution Chandra spectra of NGC 4388 measure a line production radius of $r =2.9^{+1.2}_{-0.7}~\times 10^{4}~GM/c^{2}$, formally consistent with the tentative lag. The line profile also prefers a Compton-thick reflector, indicating an origin in the disk and/or thick clumps within a wind. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our analysis and methods for testing our results in future observations, and we note the potential for X-ray reverberation lags to constrain black hole masses in obscured Seyferts wherein the optical broad line region is not visible.

  The Intergalactic Medium (IGM) contains $&gt;$50% of the baryonic mass of the Universe, yet the mechanisms responsible for keeping the IGM ionized has not been fully explained. Hence, we investigate ion abundances from the largest blind QSO absorption catalog for clouds that show C IV, N V, and O VI simultaneously. The wavelength range of present UV spectrographs, however, make it possible to probe C IV and O VI over a small range of redshift ($z \approx 0.12 - 0.15$). As a result, we only have five IGM absorbing clouds, yet these provide a powerful and representative tool to probe the IGM ionization state. We found one cloud to be in collisional ionization equilibrium while three of five showed signs of being produced by non-equilibrium processes, specifically conductive interfaces and turbulent mixing layers. None of the models we explore here were able to reproduce the ionization state of the remaining system. Energetic processes, such as galactic feedback from star formation and AGN winds, would be excellent candidates that can cause such widespread ionization.

  This review explores the field of X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs), a distinctive subset of winged radio sources that are identified by two pairs of jetted lobes which aligned by a significant angle, resulting in an inversion-symmetric structure. These lobes, encompassing active (primary) and passive (secondary) phases, exhibit a diverse range of properties across the multiple frequency bands, posing challenges in discerning their formation mechanism. The proposed mechanisms can broadly be categorized into those related either to a triaxial ambient medium, into which the jet propagates, or to a complex, central AGN mechanism, where the jet is generated. The observed characteristics of XRGs as discovered in the most substantial sample to date, challenge the idea that there is universal process at work that produces the individual sources of XRGs. Instead, the observational and numerical results rather imply the absence of an universal model and infer that distinct mechanisms may be at play for the specific sources. By scrutinizing salient and confounding properties, this review intends to propose the potential direction for future research to constrain and constrict individual models applicable to XRGs.

  Supermassive black holes in galaxies spend majority of their lifetime in the low-luminosity regime, powered by hot accretion flow. Strong winds launched from the hot accretion flow have the potential to play an important role in active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Direct observational evidence for these hot winds with temperature around 10 keV, has been obtained through the detection of highly ionized iron emission lines with Doppler shifts in two prototypical low-luminosity AGNs, namely M81* and NGC 7213. In this work, we further identify blueshifted H-like O/Ne emission lines in the soft X-ray spectra of these two sources. These lines are interpreted to be associated with additional outflowing components possessing velocity around several $10^3$ km/s and lower temperature (~0.2-0.4 keV). Blue-shifted velocity and the X-ray intensity of these additional outflowing components are hard to be explained by previously detected hot wind freely propagating to larger radii. Through detailed numerical simulations, we find the newly detected blue-shifted emission lines would come from circumnuclear gas shock-heated by the hot wind instead. Hot wind can provide larger ram pressure force on the clumpy circumnuclear gas than the gravitational force from central black hole, effectively impeding the black hole accretion of gas. Our results provide strong evidences for the energy and momentum feedback by the hot AGN wind.

  Changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a special class of AGNs that change their spectral type from type 1 to type 2 or vice versa. In recent years, a number of changing-look blazars (CLBs) were also reported, which transition between flat-spectrum radio quasars and BL Lacs. The physical properties of CLBs are still unclear. Using the $mclust$ R package for Gaussian Mixture Modeling, we performed a clustering analysis for a sample of 105 CLBs selected from the literature. Three kinds of analysis found that CLBs lie in between the parameter distributions of FSRQs and BL Lacs: (i) univariate analysis; (ii) bivariate analysis; and (iii) multivariate analysis, carried out with a dimension reduction approach of the physical properties of the three types of blazars. Our results suggest that CLBs belong to a transition type between FSRQs and BL Lacs, which may be regulated by the change of accretion process and may be similar to other changing-look AGNs.   

Tip of the iceberg: overmassive black holes at 4&lt;z&lt;7 found by JWST are
  not inconsistent with the local $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH}$-$\mathcal{M}_\star$

  JWST is revealing a new remarkable population of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim4$), low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in deep surveys and detecting the host galaxy stellar light in the most luminous and massive quasars at $z\sim 6$ for the first time. Latest results claim supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in these systems to be significantly more massive than expected from the local BH mass - stellar mass ($\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$) relation and that this is not due to sample selection effects. Through detailed statistical modeling, we demonstrate that the coupled effects of selection biases (i.e., finite detection limit and requirements on detecting broad lines) and measurement uncertainties in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH}$ and $\mathcal{M}_\star$ can in fact largely account for the reported offset and flattening in the observed $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation toward the upper envelope of the local relation, even for those at $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} &lt; 10^8\,M_{\odot}$. We further investigate the possible evolution of the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation at $z\gtrsim 4$ with careful treatment of observational biases and consideration of the degeneracy between intrinsic evolution and dispersion in this relation. The bias-corrected intrinsic $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation in the low-mass regime suggests that there might be a large population of low-mass BHs (${\rm log}\,\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} \lesssim 5$), possibly originating from lighter seeds, remaining undetected or unidentified even in the deepest JWST surveys. These results have important consequences for JWST studies of BH seeding and the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies at the earliest cosmic times.

  Models of accretion discs surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) find vast applications in high-energy astrophysics. The broad strategy is to parametrize some of the key disc properties such as gas density and temperature as a function of the radial coordinate from a given set of assumptions on the underlying physics. Two of the most popular approaches in this context were presented by Sirko &amp; Goodman (2003) and Thompson et al. (2005). We present a critical reanalysis of these widely used models, detailing their assumptions and clarifying some steps in their derivation that were previously left unsaid. Our findings are implemented in the pAGN module for the Python programming language, which is the first public implementation of these accretion-disc models. We further apply pAGN to the evolution of stellar-mass black holes embedded in AGN discs, addressing the potential occurrence of migration traps.
