  This article presents the first part of a study aimed at testing the unification paradigm for AGN (UPAGN) using the SED reconstruction code X-CIGALE. Our method consists in obtaining a generic SED for a large sample of Seyfert 1 (Sy1; part 1), then applying this SED to Seyfert 2 (Sy2; Part~II), expecting that the only difference will be the line-of-sight (LOS) angle, $i$, relative to the polar axis of the torus of gas and dust obscuring the broad line regions (BLRs). Our sample is composed of 3,896 Type 1, Sy1 at low redshifts, $ z&lt;0.4$, separated into four spectral subgroups depending on the presence or absence in their spectra of narrow emission lines, Sy1N/Sy1B, and AGN wind, Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw. The generic SED produced by X-CIGALE applies to 90\% of the Sy1 in our sample. It includes a clumpy torus with an AGN engine seen face-on ($i \sim 10^\circ \pm 5^\circ$). Our analysis not only supports the existence of a torus in Sy1, in good agreement with UPAGN, but also reveals new facts about the accretion of matter and AGN wind: 1- a sudden accretion of matter from the BLR to the accretion disk triggered the wind, 2- matter from the wind replenishes the torus, consistent with a gradual formation of this structure by recurrent AGN winds, and 3- Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw eventually evolve as AGN without wind, leaving behind a torus as evidence of a higher AGN activity in their past.

  Strong gravitational lensing of active galactic nuclei (AGN) enables measurements of cosmological parameters through time-delay cosmography (TDC). With data from the upcoming LSST survey, we anticipate using a sample of O(1000) lensed AGN for TDC. To prepare for this dataset and enable this measurement, we construct and analyze a realistic mock sample of 1300 systems drawn from the OM10 (Oguri &amp; Marshall 2010) catalog of simulated lenses with AGN sources at $z&lt;3.1$ in order to test a key aspect of the analysis pipeline, that of the lens modeling. We realize the lenses as power law elliptical mass distributions and simulate 5-year LSST i-band coadd images. From every image, we infer the lens mass model parameters using neural posterior estimation (NPE). Focusing on the key model parameters, $\theta_E$ (the Einstein Radius) and $\gamma_{lens}$ (the projected mass density profile slope), with consistent mass-light ellipticity correlations in test and training data, we recover $\theta_E$ with less than 1% bias per lens, 6.5% precision per lens and $\gamma_{lens}$ with less than 3% bias per lens, 8% precision per lens. We find that lens light subtraction prior to modeling is only useful when applied to data sampled from the training prior. If emulated deconvolution is applied to the data prior to modeling, precision improves across all parameters by a factor of 2. Finally, we combine the inferred lens mass models using Bayesian Hierarchical Inference to recover the global properties of the lens sample with less than 1% bias.

  While the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) detectors have detected over 300 binary black hole (BBH) mergers to date, the first confirmation of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to such an event remains elusive. Previous works have performed searches for counterpart candidates in transient catalogs and have identified active galactic nuclei (AGN) flares coincident with GW events; existing theory predicts that such flares may arise from the interaction of the merger remnant with the embedding accretion disk environment. We apply a statistical formalism to measure the significance of coincidence for the catalog as a whole, measuring that less than 3\% (90\% credible interval) of LVK BBH mergers give rise to observable AGN flares. This result still allows up to $\sim 40\%$ of BBH mergers to originate in AGN disks. We also examine the individual coincidences of each merger/flare pairing, determining that in all cases the flares are more likely to belong to a background population of flares not associated with GW events. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions accounting for the observability of EM counterparts in AGN disks, as well as based on the fact that the most massive AGNs (such as those included in the search) are not expected to harbor the majority of the BBHs. We emphasize that developing both the means to distinguish BBH counterpart flares from background AGN flares and an understanding of which BBHs are most likely to produce AGN flares as counterparts is critical to optimize the use of follow-up resources.

  High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM gives an unprecedented view of the ``central engine'' in active galactic nuclei, providing unique insights into black hole accretion and feedback. We present an analysis of the first XRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Seyfert-1 galaxy Mrk 279, known for its complex line profiles and variability. The data reveal velocity components within the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ emission line that can be associated with the inner face of the molecular torus ($r \geq 10^{4}~GM/c^{2})$, the broad line region (BLR; $r = 1650^{+5780}_{-1480}~GM/c^{2}$), and the inner accretion disk ($r = 81^{+280}_{-75}~GM/c^{2}$). We find evidence of low-velocity, highly ionized gas that contributes an H-like Fe XXVI emission line at 6.97 keV, confirming suggestions from prior low-resolution spectra. The data do not show slow winds in absorption, but two pairs of lines - consistent with He-like and H-like Fe shifted by $v\simeq 0.22c$ and $v\simeq 0.33c$ - improve the fit, and could represent an ultra-fast outflow (UFO). Their addition to the model only reduces the Akaike Information Criterion by 3.6 and 3.5, respectively, signaling modest support. Additional observations are needed to definitively test for the presence of fast X-ray winds in Mrk 279. We discuss these results in the context of the geometry of the central engine in AGN, emerging trends in XRISM studies of AGN, and the nature of the potential UFOs.

  Modern cosmological simulations have now matured to the point of reproducing the evolution of realistic galaxy populations across cosmic time. These simulations rely on feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to quench massive galaxies, yet the details of this process remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we introduce RAFIKI (Refining AGN Feedback In Kinetic Implementations), a novel suite of simulations built upon SIMBA-C that vary the mass loading of AGN-driven winds. Unlike the fiducial SIMBA-C simulation, RAFIKI separates the efficiencies of the two kinetic feedback modes, enabling a detailed study of their impact on galaxies, black holes, and the circumgalactic medium. We explore a range of galaxy and baryon properties in the RAFIKI runs and find that even with enhanced mass loading, the lower-velocity, quasar-type mode cannot quench massive galaxies. However, it plays a significant role in regulating black hole growth and star formation in intermediate-mass galaxies. We also uncover degeneracies in the parameter space that highlight the limited current constraints on AGN feedback. RAFIKI provides a controlled framework to disentangle these degeneracies using current and upcoming observations.   

On the Evolution of Disk-Embedded Binaries: Framing Local Models in
  Global Context

  The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have in recent years been recognized as possible sites for gravitational wave sources, leading to a series of numerical studies on the evolution of disk-embedded black hole binaries. The majority of these works have been carried out so far using the shearing box, a local Cartesian domain co-rotating with the binary center-of-mass around the supermassive black hole. The local nature of this framework allows for focusing computational power close to the binary at the expense of detaching the gas flow around the binary from the global dynamics. In this paper, we provide a framework to assess the applicability of the shearing box for studying the long-term evolution of the orbital elements of the embedded binary in viscous hydrodynamic disks. We accomplish this by identifying the conditions under which relevant global timescales are longer than the gas-induced evolution timescale of the embedded binary across various AGN disk models. For black hole masses of interest, we report the existence of radii beyond which the global influence of the disk may be reasonably neglected, supporting the use of the shearing box. More generally, we introduce a systematic approach to link local simulations with the global problem they aim to approximate while providing a way to gauge their accuracy. This will prove to be essential as we seek to add additional physics, such as magnetic fields and radiative transport, to develop more realistic models for black hole binary mergers and their potential electromagnetic signatures in AGN disks.

  Central starbursts and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to be fueled by either galaxy interactions or secular processes in gravitationally unstable discs. We employ cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project to propose a new nuclear fueling scenario based on the transition that galaxies undergo from bursty to smooth star formation and from prominent global galactic winds to inefficient stellar feedback as they grow above $M_{\star}\sim 10^{10-10.5}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$: the last major galactic wind event shuts down star formation, evacuates gas from the galaxy, and slows down gas accretion from the circumgalactic medium (CGM), creating a $\sim$$10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ pileup of gas in the inner CGM which later accretes coherently onto the galaxy, achieving a tenfold increase in inflow rate over pre-outflow conditions. We explicitly track the accumulation of gas along the outflow pathway owing to hydrodynamic interactions and show that $\sim$50% of gas fueling the central $\sim$10-100$\,{\rm pc}$ over the subsequent $\sim$15$\,{\rm Myr}$ can be traced back to pileup gas having experienced $&gt;$50% change in infall velocity owing to the wind interaction. This galactic wind pileup effect may thus represent a significant fueling mode for compact starbursts and luminous AGN. Galactic winds at earlier times or AGN-driven outflows can have qualitatively similar effects, but the pileup of gas driven by the last major galactic wind event refuels the galaxy precisely when the deepening stellar potential prevents further gas evacuation by stellar feedback, providing the ideal conditions for quasar fueling at the time when AGN feedback is most needed to regulate central star formation in massive galaxies at their peak of activity.
