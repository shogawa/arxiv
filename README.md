  At present, there is a lack of effective probes to distinguish between mid-infrared (MIR) outbursts induced by tidal disruption events (TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) based on only MIR data. Here, we propose that the time variation of MIR color (K-corrected W1-W2 after subtracting the quiescent fluxes) is a promising probe. With an optically selected sample containing TDEs, ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), and CLAGNs, we studied the MIR color variation of their MIR counterparts using NEOWISE-R data. We found that the MIR color of TDEs and ANTs turns red faster than CLAGNs during the rising phase, and TDEs have a redder color than ANTs at the earliest phase. The former may be caused by the difference between the ultraviolet light curves of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs, or be related to no or relatively weak underlying AGN in TDEs/ANTs, while the latter may be related to the difference in the dust geometry. Based on color variation rate, we selected high-probability TDE, ANT, and CLAGN candidates from MIR outbursts in samples of Jiang et al. (2021) and Masterson et al. (2024). We found that both samples are mixtures of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs. For MIR outbursts whose hosts are not Seyfert galaxies, we estimated that $\sim50\%-80\%$ are TDEs and inferred a rate of infrared TDEs of $1.5-2.8\times10^{-5}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable with that of optical TDEs. The rest are CLAGNs, suggesting the presence of weak AGNs that cannot be identified using common diagnoses. We predicted that with our method, a large amount of dust-obscured TDEs could be selected from future infrared surveys with higher data quality and cadence.

  In this manuscript, an oversimplified model is proposed to test the effects of intrinsic AGN variability on expected optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) related to sub-pc binary black hole systems (BBHs) in broad line AGN. The commonly accepted CAR (Continuous AutoRegressive) process is applied to describe intrinsic AGN variability related to each BH accreting system in a sub-pc BBH system. Considering obscurations related to orbital rotations with periodicity $T_p$, artificial light curves including signals for optical QPOs can be built. Then, comparing the intrinsic periodicities $T_p$ with the measured robust periodicities $T_o$ through the artificial light curves, distributions of $T_p/T_o$ have four significant peaks around 1, 2, 3 and 4, leading less than half of the artificial light curves to have consistency between $T_o$ and $T_p$. Moreover, different collected model parameters have few effects on the distributions of $T_p/T_o$, indicating the effects of intrinsic AGN variability on optical QPOs are significantly strong and stable. Furthermore, after checking properties of optical QPOs in the light curves with different time steps, there are tiny effects of time steps on optical QPOs.

  We investigated by means of MUSE/VLT observations the true size of the coronal line region (CLR) in a local sample of nine active galactic nuclei known for displaying prominent coronal emission. Our analysis show that the CLR is extended from several hundred parsecs to a few kiloparsecs in the lines of [Fe VII] (IP=99 eV) and [Fe X] (IP=235 eV). In all cases, the coronal emission is closely aligned along the radio-jet axis and constrained to the limits of the [O III] ionisation cone. Besides the nuclear emission, secondary emission peaks in [Fe VII] and [Fe X] are found along the extended emission, with a shallow decrease of the line intensity with increasing distance from the AGN. Both facts suggest the action of an additional excitation mechanism besides nuclear photoionisation for the origin of the coronal gas. This is further supported by the fact that in some sources the extended coronal emission accounts for more than 50\% of the total emission and by the high degree of gas excitation in the off-nuclear region. A positive trend between the coronal line luminosity and the jet power points to shocks induced by the jet passage as the key mechanism to produce and excite this gas. We provide the first estimate of the [Fe X] coronal gas size, being in the kpc range. Our results stress the importance of the CLR as a key ingredient that should be fully considered in models trying to explain the physics of the narrow line region in AGN.

  In the context of the life cycle and evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN), the environment plays an important role. In particular, the over-dense environments of galaxy groups, where dynamical interactions and bulk motions have significant impact, offer an excellent but under-explored window into the life cycles of AGN and the processes that shape the evolution of relativistic plasma. Pilot Survey observations with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey recovered diffuse emission associated with the nearby (z = 0.0228) galaxy group HCG15, which was revealed to be strongly linearly polarised. We study the properties of this emission in unprecedented detail to settle open questions about its nature and its relation to the group-member galaxies. We perform a multi-frequency spectropolarimetric study of HCG15 incorporating our ASKAP EMU observations as well as new data from MeerKAT, LOFAR, the GMRT, and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), plus X-ray data from XMM-Newton and optical spectra from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). Our study confirms that the diffuse structure represents remnant emission from historic AGN activity, likely associated with HCG15-D, some 80-86 Myr ago (based on ageing analysis). We detect significant highly linearly-polarised emission from a diffuse 'ridge'-like structure with a highly ordered magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that this emission is generated by draping of magnetic field lines in the intra-group medium (IGrM), although further exploration with simulations would aid our understanding. We confirm that HCG15-C is a group-member galaxy. Finally, we report the detection of thermal emission associated with a background cluster at redshift z ~ 0.87 projected onto the IGrM of HCG15, which matches the position and redshift of the recent SZ detection of ACT-CL J0207.8+0209.
