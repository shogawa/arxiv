  We provide a review of our current knowledge of galaxies throughout the first billion years of cosmic history. This field has undergone a transformation in the last two years following the launch of $\textit{JWST}$, and we aim to deliver an observational overview of what we have learned about $z\gtrsim 5$ galaxies. We introduce the latest selection methods of high redshift galaxies and describe new measurements of the census of continuum-selected and dusty star forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim 5$. We discuss new measurements of the UV luminosity function at $z\gtrsim 10$ and associated implications for early star formation. We then summarize what is being learned about the physical properties of early galaxies, with up-to-date discussions of the sizes, masses, ages, metallicities, abundance patterns, UV colors, dust properties, and ionizing sources in $z\gtrsim 5$ galaxies. We review observational evidence for bursty star formation histories and describe prospects for characterizing the duty cycle with future observations. We provide a brief overview of the insight being gained through new detections of AGN in early galaxies. Finally we introduce the latest constraints on the contribution of galaxies to reionziation and discuss how $\textit{JWST}$ measurements of Ly$\alpha$ emission offer the potential to probe the earliest stages of the process. This review is meant to provide a broad introduction to those new to the observational study of very high redshift galaxies.

  Bars are ubiquitously found in disc galaxies and are known to drive galaxy evolution through secular processes. However, the specific contribution of bars in suppression of star formation (SF) is still under inspection which we investigate in this paper using spatially resolved UV-optical colour maps &amp; radial color profiles of a sample of 17 centrally quenched (CQ) barred galaxies in redshift range 0.02-0.06. The sample is selected based on their location in M$_{\ast}$ - SFR plane. They are classified as passive based on parameters from MPA-JHU VAC, but non-passive based on the GSWLC catalog, indicating a passive inner region &amp; recent star formation in their extended disc. We use archival SDSS r-band and GALEX FUV &amp; NUV imaging data and created spatially resolved (FUV-NUV vs NUV-r) colour maps to understand the nature of UV emission from different regions of these galaxies. We then analyse their NUV-r radial profiles using NUV-r colour as a proxy for stellar population (SP) age. A control sample of 8 CQ unbarred galaxies is also analysed to disentangle the effect of bulge and bar in quenching SF. The CQ barred galaxies display redder colors (NUV-r $&gt;$ 4-4.5 mag) in inner regions, up to the length of the bar, indicating the age of stellar population in these regions to be older than $&gt;$ 1 Gyr. Most barred galaxies in our sample host pseudo bulges and do not host AGN, emphasizing most probable reason for the internal quenching is action of stellar bar. In comparison to the unbarred, the barred galaxies show redder colors to a larger spatial extent. We conclude that bars in their later stages of evolution turn the inner regions of galaxies redder, leading to quenching, with the effect being most prominent up to the ends of the bar and creating a region dominated by older SP. This may occur when bars have already funneled gas to the galactic centre leaving behind no fuel for further SF.

  We conduct the first systematic survey of a total of eleven optical coronal lines in the spectra of a large sample of low redshift (z &lt; 0.8) Type 1 quasars observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that strong coronal line emission is rare in SDSS even in Type 1 quasars; only 885 out of 19,508 (4.5%) galaxies show at least one coronal line, with higher ionization potential lines ($&gt;100$eV) being even rarer. The [Ne V] $\lambda$3426 line, which constitutes the majority of detections, is strongly correlated with the bolometric luminosity. These findings suggest that the optical coronal lines are significantly suppressed in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a result of the presence of dust in the emitting regions. We find that the incidence of ionized outflows is significantly higher in coronal line emitters compared with non-coronal line emitters, possibly suggesting that dust destruction in outflows enhances coronal line emission in AGNs. Many coronal lines show line profiles that are broader than those of narrow lines, and are blue-shifted relative the lower ionization potential lines, suggesting outflows in the highly ionized gas. Given the limited number of detections, we do not find any statistically significant trends of detection statistics, or line ratios with black hole mass, Eddington ratio, or AGN bolometric luminosity. The catalog is publicly available and can provide a useful database of the coronal line properties of low redshift quasars that can be compared to the growing number of high-z AGNs discovered by JWST.

  While cosmological simulations of galaxy formation have reached maturity, able to reproduce many fundamental galaxy and halo properties, no consensus has yet been reached on the impact of `baryonic feedback' on the non-linear matter power spectrum. This severely limits the precision of (and potentially biases) small-scale cosmological constraints obtained from weak lensing and galaxy surveys. Recent observational evidence indicates that `baryonic feedback' may be more extreme than commonly assumed in current cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we therefore explore a range of empirical AGN feedback models, within the FABLE simulation suite, with different parameterizations as a function of cosmic time, host halo properties, and/or spatial location where feedback energy is thermalized. We demonstrate that an AGN radio-mode feedback acting in a larger population of black holes, with jets thermalizing at relatively large cluster-centric distances, as exemplified by our XFABLE model, is in good agreement with the latest weak lensing + kSZ constraints across all k-scales. Furthermore, XFABLE maintains good agreement with the galaxy stellar mass function, gas fraction measurements, and all key galaxy group and cluster properties, including scaling relations and ICM radial profiles. Our work highlights the pressing need to model black hole accretion and feedback physics with a greater level of realism, including relativistic, magnetized jets in full cosmological simulations. Finally, we discuss how a range of complementary observational probes in the near future will enable us to constrain AGN feedback models, and therefore reduce `baryonic feedback' modelling uncertainty for the upcoming era of large cosmological surveys.

  Deep extragalactic X-ray surveys, such as the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy field (CCLS), are prone to be biased against active galactic nuclei (AGN) with high column densities due to their lower count rates at a given luminosity. To quantify this selection effect, we forward model nearby ($z\sim0.05$) AGN from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) with well-characterized ($\gtrsim$1000 cts) broadband X-ray spectra (0.5-195 keV) to simulate the CCLS absorption distribution. We utilize the BASS low-redshift analogs with similar luminosities to the CCLS ($L_\mathrm{2-10\ keV}^\mathrm{int}\sim10^{42-45}\ \mathrm{erg}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$), which are much less affected by obscuration and low-count statistics, as the seed for our simulations, and follow the spectral fitting of the CCLS. Our simulations reveal that Chandra would fail to detect the majority (53.3%; 563/1056) of obscured ($N_\mathrm{H}&gt;10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) simulated BASS AGN given the observed redshift and luminosity distribution of the CCLS. Even for detected sources with sufficient counts ($\geq30$) for spectral modeling, the level of obscuration is significantly overestimated. This bias is most extreme for objects whose best fit indicates a high-column density AGN ($N_\mathrm{H}\geq10^{24}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), since the majority (66.7%; 18/27) of these are actually unobscured sources ($N_\mathrm{H}&lt;10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). This implies that previous studies may have significantly overestimated the increase in the obscured fraction with redshift and the fraction of luminous obscured AGN. Our findings highlight the importance of directly considering obscuration biases and forward modeling in X-ray surveys, as well as the need for higher-sensitivity X-ray missions such as the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), and the importance of multi-wavelength indicators to estimate obscuration in distant supermassive black holes.

  In this manuscript, properties of spectroscopic continuum emissions are considered to detect potential tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among SDSS quasars. After considering the simple blackbody photosphere model applied to describe quasar continuum emissions with parameters of blackbody temperature $T_{BB}$ and blackbody radius $R_{BB}$, SDSS quasars and reported optical TDEs occupy distinct regions in the space of $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$. Then, through the dependence of $R_{BB}$ on $T_{BB}$ for SDSS quasars, 402 outliers in SDSS Stripe82 region can be collected. Among the 402 outliers, the SDSS J2308 at $z=1.16$ is mainly considered, due to its SDSS spectrum observed around the peak brightness of the light curves. With the 7.2-year-long light curves described by theoretical TDE model, the determined $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$ through its spectroscopic continuum emissions are consistent with the TDE model determined values, to support the central TDE. Moreover, considering simulated results on continuum emissions of SDSS quasars around $z\sim1.16$, confidence level higher than 4$\sigma$ can be confirmed that the continuum emissions of SDSS J2308 are not related to normal quasars. Furthermore, accepted CAR process to simulate intrinsic AGN variability, the confidence level higher than $3\sigma$ can be confirmed that the long-term light curves of SDSS J2308 are related to a central TDE. Jointed the probabilities through both spectroscopic and photometric simulations, the confidence level higher than $5\sigma$ can be confirmed to support the central TDE in SDSS J2308.

  Context. We use the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) Fourth Data Release (DR4) to identify and classify H$\alpha$-excess point sources in the Southern Sky, combining photometric data from 12 S-PLUS filters with machine learning to improve classification of H$\alpha$-related phenomena. Aims. Our goal is to classify H$\alpha$-excess point sources by distinguishing Galactic and extragalactic objects, particularly those with redshifted emission lines, and identifying variability phenomena like RR Lyrae stars. Methods. We selected H$\alpha$-excess candidates using the ($r - J0660$) vs. ($r - i$) colour-colour diagram from the S-PLUS main survey (MS) and Galactic Disk Survey (GDS). UMAP for dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN clustering were used to separate source types. Infrared data was incorporated, and a Random Forest model was trained on clustering results to identify key colour features. New colour-colour diagrams from S-PLUS MS and infrared data offer a preliminary classification. Results. Combining multiwavelength data with machine learning significantly improved H$\alpha$-excess source classification. We identified 6956 sources with excess in the $J0660$ filter. Cross-matching with SIMBAD explored object types, including emission-line stars, young stellar objects, nebulae, stellar binaries, cataclysmic variables, QSOs, AGNs, and galaxies. Using S-PLUS colours and machine learning, we separated RR Lyrae stars from other sources. The separation of Galactic and extragalactic sources was clearer, but distinguishing cataclysmic variables from QSOs at certain redshifts remained challenging. Infrared data refined the classification, and the Random Forest model highlighted key colour features for future follow-up spectroscopy.

  ALMA observations have shown that candidate "post-starburst" galaxies (PSBs) at z$\sim$0.6 can retain significant molecular gas reservoirs. These results would imply that -- unlike many model predictions -- galaxies can shut down their star formation before their cold gas reservoirs are depleted. However, these studies inferred star formation rates (SFRs) either from [O II] line fluxes or from spectral energy distribution modeling, and could have missed large dust-obscured contributions to the SFRs. In this study, we present Keck/NIRES observations of 13 massive ($\mathrm{M_*}\gtrsim \times 10^{11} \,\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) PSBs, which allow us to estimate $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ SFRs in these gas-rich post-starburst galaxies. We confirm the previously inferred low SFRs for the majority of the sample: 11/13 targets show clear $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ absorption, with minimal infilling indicating dust-corrected SFRs of $&lt;4.1 \,\mathrm{M_\odot\, yr^{-1}}$. These SFRs are notably low given the large $\mathrm{H_2}$ reservoirs ($\sim 1-5 \times 10^{10} \,\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) present in 5/13 of these galaxies, placing them significantly offset from star-forming galaxies on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for star-forming galaxies. The [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios of all 13 PSBs imply contributions from non-star-forming ionization mechanisms (e.g., AGN, shocks, or hot evolved stars) to their $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emission, suggesting that even these low ongoing SFRs may be overestimated. These low $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ SFRs, dust-corrected using A$_v$ estimates from SED fitting, confirm that these galaxies are very likely quiescent and, thus, that galaxies can quench before their cold gas reservoirs are fully depleted.
