  We present 12 new AGN at 4&lt;z&lt;7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z=10.6) revealed through the detection of a Broad Line Region as seen in the Balmer emission lines. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases we find evidence for two broad components of Halpha which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs). The inferred BH masses range between 8 x 10^7 Msun down to 4 x 10^5 Msun, interestingly probing the regime expected for Direct Collapse Black Holes. The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities (~10^44-10^45 erg/s) imply accretion rates that are &lt; 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BH, with M_BH ~ 10^6 Msun, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BH at z~4-11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies stellar masses when compared to the local M_BH-Mstar relation. However, we find that these early BH tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M_BH and velocity dispersion, as well as between M_BH and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the BPT excitation-diagnostic diagram these AGN are located in the region that is that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what expected for AGN hosted in metal poor galaxies (Z ~ 0.1-0.2 Zsun). The fraction of broad line AGN with L_AGN &gt; 10^44 erg/s, among galaxies in the redshift range 4&lt;z&lt;6, is about 10%, suggesting that the contribution of AGN and their hosts to the reionization of the Universe is &gt; 10%.

  In the light of growing evidence that blazars are responsible for part of the astrophysical very-high-energy neutrino flux detected by IceCube, models for neutrino production through photo-pion interactions in blazar jets have been developed. Evidence is also mounting that photon fields originating external to the jet are strongly favored over the co-moving primary electron synchrotron photon field as target for photo-pion interactions. Even though those external photon fields appear highly anisotropic in the co-moving frame of the emission region, current models usually consider neutrino production to occur isotropically in the co-moving frame, resulting in a beaming pattern that is identical to intrinsically isotropic synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. In this paper, we derive the resulting beaming patterns of neutrinos produced by interactions wich external photon fields, taking into account all relevant anisotropy effects. It is shown that neutrino emission resulting from photo-pion production on a stationary and isotropic (in the AGN rest frame) external photon field is significantly more strongly beamed along the jet direction than intrinsically isotropic emission. For the most highly beamed sources, this implies that expected neutrino fluxes are grossly under-estimated or jet-power requirements for the production of a given neutrino flux grossly over-estimated when not accounting for the proper Doppler boosting and beaming characteristics.

  We introduce the Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) survey. SFACT is a new narrow-band survey for emission-line galaxies (ELGs) and QSOs being carried out using the wide-field imager on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. Because of the superior depth and excellent image quality afforded by WIYN, we routinely detect ELGs to r = 25.0. Our survey observations are made using three custom narrow-band filters centered on 6590 A, 6950 A, and 7460 A. Due to the sensitivity of the survey, we are able to simultaneously detect sources via a number of different emission lines over a wide range of redshifts. The principal lines detected in SFACT are H-alpha (redshifts up to 0.144), [O III]5007 (redshifts up to 0.500) and [O II]3727 (redshifts up to 1.015). In this paper we detail the properties of the survey as well as present initial results obtained by analyzing our three pilot-study fields. These fields have yielded a total of 533 ELG candidates in an area of 1.50 square degrees (surface density of 355 ELGs per square degree). Follow-up spectra for a subset of the ELG candidates are also presented. One of the key attributes of the SFACT survey is that the ELGs are detected in discrete redshift windows that will allow us to robustly quantify the properties of the star-forming and AGN populations as a function of redshift to z = 1 and beyond. The planned acquisition of additional narrow-band filters will allow us to expand our survey to substantially higher redshifts.
