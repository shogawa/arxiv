  Outflows are believed to be ubiquitous in all AGNs, although their presence in low luminosity AGNs, in particular, for LINERs, has only started to be explored. Their properties (geometry, mass and energetics) are still far from being properly characterised. We use integral field spectroscopic data from the MEGARA instrument, at GTC, to analyse a small sample of nine LINERs, candidates of hosting ionised gas outflows. We aim to study the main emission lines in the optical to identify their properties and physical origin. We obtained data cubes at the lowest (R$\sim$6000) and highest (R$\sim$20000) spectral resolution of MEGARA. We modelled and subtracted the stellar continuum to obtain the ionised gas contribution, and then fitted the emission lines to extract their kinematics (velocity and velocity dispersion). We identified outflows as a secondary component in the emission lines. The primary component of the emission lines was typically associated to gas in the galactic disc. For some objects, there is an enhanced-$\sigma$ region co-spatial with the secondary component. We associated it to turbulent gas produced due to the interaction with the outflows. We find signatures of outflows in six LINERs, with mass outflow rates ranging from 0.004 to 0.4 M$_{sun}$yr$^{-1}$ and energy rates from $\sim$10$^{38}$ to $\sim$10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Their mean electronic density is 600cm$^{-3}$, extending to distances of $\sim$400 pc at an (absolute) velocity of $\sim$340 km s$^{-1}$ (on average). They tend to be compact and unresolved, although for some sources they are extended with a bubble-like morphology. Our results confirm the existence of outflows in the best LINER candidates identified using previous long-slit spectroscopic and imaging data. These outflows do not follow the scaling relations obtained for more luminous AGNs. For some objects we discuss jets as the main drivers of the outflows

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) play an integral role in galaxy formation and evolution by influencing galaxies and their environments through radio jet feedback. Historically, interpreting observations of radio galaxies and quantifying radio jet feedback has been challenging due to degeneracies between their physical parameters. In particular, it is well-established that different combinations of jet kinetic power and environment density can yield indistinguishable radio continuum properties, including apparent size and Stokes I luminosity. We present an approach to breaking this degeneracy by probing the line-of-sight environment with Faraday rotation. We study this effect in simulations of three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic AGN jets in idealised environments with turbulent magnetic fields. We generate synthetic Stokes I emission and Faraday rotation measure (RM) maps, which enable us to distinguish between our simulated sources. We find enhanced RMs near the jet head and lobe edges and an RM reversal across the jet axis. We show that increasing the environment density and the average cluster magnetic field strength broadens the distribution of Faraday rotation measure values. We study the depolarisation properties of our sources, finding that the hotspot regions depolarise at lower frequencies than the lobes. We quantify the effect of depolarisation on the RM distribution, finding that the frequency at which the source is too depolarised to measure the RM distribution accurately is a probe of environmental properties. This technique offers a range of new opportunities for upcoming surveys, including probing radio galaxy environments and determining more accurate estimates of the AGN feedback budget.

  Mrk 783 is a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy that possesses a relatively large two-sided radio emission extending up to 14 kpc from the active nucleus possibly connected with a large-scale ionized gas emission. We obtained a deep [OIII] image that revealed an extended system of emission knots and diffuse ionized gas surrounding the main galaxy. The high-excited gas is related not only with the radio structure, but also with tidal features illuminated by the active nucleus radiation up to the projected distance 41 kpc as it follows from the emission lines intensities and kinematics derived from the long-slit spectroscopic data. Moreover the part of the disk of the companion galaxy SDSS J130257.20+162537.1 located at 99 kpc projected distances to the north of Mrk 783 also falls in the AGN ionizing cone. It is possible that Mrk 783 can be considered as `Hanny's Voorwerp precursor', i.e. a galaxy that demonstrates signs of sequential switching from radio-loud to radio-quiet nuclear activity, in the moment before falling of its ionization luminosity.

  We present full Stokes MeerKAT L band (856--1712\,MHz) observations of \chg{36} high latitude supernova remnants. Sensitive, high dynamic range images show a wealth of structure. G15.1$-$1.6 appears to be an HII region rather than an SNR. G30.7$-$2.0 consists of three background extragalactic sources which appear to form an arc when imaged with much lower resolution. At least half of the remnants in the sample contain ``blowouts'', or ``ears'' showing these to be a common feature. Analysis of the polarimetric data reveals details of the magnetic field structure in the emitting regions of the remnants as well as magnetized thermal plasma in front of polarized emission. The chance alignment of G327.6+14.6 with a background AGN with very extended polarized jets allows testing for the presence of Faraday effects in the interior of the remnant. Scant evidence of Faraday rotating material is found in the interior of this remnant.

  Radio galaxies dominate the radio sky and are essential to the galaxy evolution puzzle. High-resolution studies of statistical samples of radio galaxies are expected to shed light on the triggering mechanisms of the AGN, alternating between the phases of activity and quiescence. In this work, we focus on the sub-arcsec radio structures in the central regions of the 35 radio galaxies over 6.6 $deg^2$ of the Lockman Hole region. These sources were previously classified as active, remnant, and candidate restarted radio galaxies using 150 MHz LOFAR observations. We examine the morphologies and study the spectral properties of their central regions to explore their evolutionary stages and revise the criteria used to select the initial sample. We use the newly available LOFAR 150 MHz image obtained using international baselines, achieving 0.38'' x 0.30'' resolution, making this the first systematic study of the nuclear regions at high resolution and low frequency. We use publicly available images from the FIRST survey at 1.4 GHz and the Karl G. Jansky VLA Sky Survey at 3 GHz to achieve our goals. In addition, for one restarted candidate we present new dedicated observations with the VLA at 3 GHz. We have found various morphologies of the central regions of the radio galaxies in our sample, some resembling miniature double-double radio galaxies. We also see the beginnings of active jets or distinct detections unrelated to the large-scale structure. Furthermore, we have found diverse radio spectra in our sample - flat, steep, or peaked between 150 MHz and 3 GHz, indicative of the different life-cycle phases. Based on these analyses, we confirm five of six previously considered restarted candidates and identify three more from the active sample, supporting previous results suggesting that the restarted phase can occur after a relatively short remnant phase (i.e. a few tens of millions of years).

  The statistical distribution and evolution of key properties (e.g. accretion rate, mass, or spin) of active galactic nuclei (AGN), remain an open debate in astrophysics. The ESA Euclid space mission, launched on July 1st 2023, promises a breakthrough in this field. We create detailed mock catalogues of AGN spectra, from the rest-frame near-infrared down to the ultraviolet, including emission lines, to simulate what Euclid will observe for both obscured (type 2) and unobscured (type 1) AGN. We concentrate on the red grisms of the NISP instrument, which will be used for the wide-field survey, opening a new window for spectroscopic AGN studies in the near-infrared. We quantify the efficiency in the redshift determination as well as in retrieving the emission line flux of the H$\alpha$+[NII] complex as Euclid is mainly focused on this emission line as it is expected to be the brightest one in the probed redshift range. Spectroscopic redshifts are measured for 83% of the simulated AGN in the interval where the H$\alpha$+[NII] is visible (0.89&lt;z&lt;1.83 at a line flux $&gt;2x10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, encompassing the peak of AGN activity at $z\simeq 1-1.5$) within the spectral coverage of the red grism. Outside this redshift range, the measurement efficiency decreases significantly. Overall, a spectroscopic redshift is correctly determined for ~90% of type 2 AGN down to an emission line flux of $3x10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, and for type 1 AGN down to $8.5x10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Recovered black hole mass values show a small offset with respect to the input values ~10%, but the agreement is good overall. With such a high spectroscopic coverage at z&lt;2, we will be able to measure AGN demography, scaling relations, and clustering from the epoch of the peak of AGN activity down to the present-day Universe for hundreds of thousand AGN with homogeneous spectroscopic information.
