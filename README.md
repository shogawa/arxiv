  From the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey second data release (LoTSS DR2) at 144 MHz, we identified a peculiar radio galaxy, J0011+3217. It has a large, one-sided diffuse secondary wing that stretches up to 0.85 Mpc (roughly 85\% of the primary lobe). The linear size of the primary lobe of the galaxy is 0.99 Mpc. This peculiar source is a giant radio galaxy with a misaligned primary lobe. An optical galaxy resides at 16 kpc (7 arcsec) linear distance from the host active galactic nucleus (AGN) of J0011+3217. J0011+3217 has a radio luminosity of $1.65\times 10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 144 MHz with a spectral index of $-0.80$ between 144 and 607 MHz. J0011+3217 is located 1.2 Mpc away from the center of the Abell 7 cluster. The Abell 7 cluster has a redshift of 0.104 and a mass ($M_{500}$) of 3.71 $\times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. The cluster is associated with strong X-ray emission. To study the X-ray emission around the cluster and from the region surrounding J0011+3217, we present an XMM-Newton image of J0011+3217, and we analyse the velocity structure and spatial distribution of galaxies in the cluster, showing that J0011+3217 inhabits an offset group of galaxies that are moving with respect to Abell 7. The off-axis distortion or bending of the primary lobe of J0011+3217 in the outer edges has a strong effect on the relative motion of the surrounding medium that causes the bending of the jets in the opposite direction of the cluster (like WAT sources). The current paper suggests that the morphology of J0011+3217 is influenced by ram pressure created due to the Abell 7 cluster, highlighting the complex interactions between the source and the surrounding cluster environment.

  The nature of the interaction between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their host galaxies remains an unsolved question. Therefore, conducting an AGN census is valuable to AGN research. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of AGNs are obscured by their environment, which blocks UV and optical emissions due to the dusty torus surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). To overcome this challenge, mid-infrared (IR) surveys have emerged as a valuable tool for identifying obscured AGNs, as the obscured light is re-emitted in this range. With its high sensitivity, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) uncovered more fainter objects than previous telescopes. By applying the SED fitting, this work investigates AGN candidates in JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) fields. We identified 42 candidates, 30 of them are classified as composites ($0.2\leq f_{\rm AGN, IR}&lt; 0.5$), and 12 of them are AGNs ($f_{\rm AGN, IR}\geq 0.5$). We report the AGN luminosity contributions and AGN number fractions as a function of redshift and total infrared luminosity, showing that previously reported increasing relations are not apparent in our sample due to the sample size. We also extend the previous results on ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, $L_{\rm TIR}\geq 10^{12} L_{\odot}$) to less luminous AGNs, highlighting the power of JWST.
