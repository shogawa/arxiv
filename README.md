  Cosmic dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, significantly influencing star formation and the interstellar medium. However, in active galactic nuclei (AGN), the role and origin of dust remain poorly understood. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing the properties of dust in AGN. NGC 6860, an X-ray bright type-1 quasar, is an ideal target for investigating the connection between dust and winds in AGN. It exhibits reddening and X-ray absorption by both dust and winds. By modeling high-resolution X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we determine the properties of dust and outflows in this AGN. Our analysis finds four photoionized components, outflowing with velocities of 50-300 km/s. The first two are relatively highly ionized with logxi = 3.4 and logxi = 2.9. The results of our photoionization modeling suggest that these two components are thermally unstable. The third component is ionized, with logxi = 2.3 and is located further away from the central black hole. The fourth component is less ionized, and is possibly located in the host galaxy. The application of dust models enables us to probe the abundance and location of the dust in NGC 6860. Our findings suggest that dust absorption and reddening originates from the extended narrow-line region and its host galaxy.

  In this paper, we present a semi-empirical calibration between the oxygen abundance and the $N2$ emission-line ratio for Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Regions (LINERs). This relation was derived by comparing the optical spectroscopic data of 118 nuclear spaxels classified as LINERs using three different BPT diagrams from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies survey (MaNGA) and sub-classified as weak (wAGN, 84 objects) and strong (sAGN, 34 objects) AGN (active galactic nucleus) from the WHAN diagnostic diagram and photoionization model results obtained with the {\sc cloudy} code assuming gas accretion into a black hole (representing an AGN). We found that our wAGN LINERs exhibit an oxygen abundance in the range of $8.50 \lesssim \mathrm{12+\log(O/H)} \lesssim 8.90 $, with an average value of $\mathrm{12+\log(O/H)}=8.68$, while our sAGN LINERs exhibit an oxygen abundance in the range of $8.51 \lesssim \: \mathrm{12+\log(O/H)} \: \lesssim \: 8.81 $, with an average value of $\mathrm{12+\log(O/H)}=8.65$. Our abundance estimations are in good agreement with those derived for another two different samples one of them with 463 Seyfert 2 objects and the other with 43 LINERs galaxies ionized by post-AGB stars, showing that the assumptions of our models are likely suitable for wAGN and sAGN LINERs. A relation between the equivalent width of the observed H$\alpha$ emission-line and the estimated ionization parameter provided by models was obtained. Our results also suggest that LINERs does not show a clear correlation between oxygen abundances and the stellar mass of the hosting galaxies.

  We present NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array observations of CO(8-7), (9-8), and (10-9) lines, as well as the underlying continuum for two far-infrared luminous quasars: SDSS J2054-0005 at $\rm z=6.0389$ and SDSS J0129-0035 at $\rm z=5.7788$. Both quasars were previously detected in CO (2-1) and (6-5) transitions, making them candidates for studying the CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED) of quasars at $z \sim 6$. Utilizing the radiative transfer code CLOUDY, we fit the CO SLED with two heating mechanisms, including the photo-dissociation region (PDR) and X-ray-dominated region (XDR) for both objects. The CO SLEDs can be fitted by either a dense PDR component with an extremely strong far-ultraviolet radiation field (gas density $ n_{\rm H} \sim 10^6 \, \rm cm^{-3}$ and field strength $G_0 \gtrsim 10^6$) or a two-component model including a PDR and an XDR. However, the line ratios, including \tir and previous \cii and \ci measurements, argue against a very high PDR radiation field strength. Thus, the results prefer a PDR+XDR origin for the CO SLED. The excitation of the high-J CO lines in both objects is likely dominated by the central AGN. We then check the CO (9-8)-to-(6-5) line luminosity ratio $r_{96}$ for all $z \sim 6$ quasars with available CO SLEDs (seven in total) and find that there are no clear correlations between $r_{96}$ and both \fir and the AGN UV luminosities. This further demonstrates the complexity of the CO excitation powered by both the AGN and nuclear star formation in these young quasar host galaxies.

  Far-infrared (FIR) surveys are critical to probing the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies, since of order half the light from accreting black holes and active star formation is emitted in the rest-frame infrared over $0.5\lesssim z \lesssim 10$. For deep fields with areas of 1 deg$^2$ or less, like the legacy surveys GOODS, COSMOS, and CANDELS, source crowding means that sub-arcsecond resolution is essential. In this paper we show with a simulation of the FIR sky that measurements made with a small telescope (2 m) at low angular resolution yield biased results, and we demonstrate the scientific value of a space mission that would offer sub-arcsecond resolution. We envisage a facility that would provide high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy over the wavelength range $25-400\,\mu$m, and we present predictions for an extragalactic survey covering $0.5\,\hbox{deg}^2$. Such a survey is expected to detect tens of thousands of star-forming galaxies and thousands of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), in multiple FIR lines (e.g. [CII], [OI], [CI]) and continuum. At the longest wavelengths (200-400$\,\mu$m), it would probe beyond the reionization epoch, up to $z\sim 7$-8. A combination of spectral resolution, line sensitivity, and broad spectral coverage would allow us to learn about the physical conditions (temperature, density, metallicity) characterizing the interstellar medium of galaxies over the past $\sim 12$ billion years and to investigate galaxy-AGN co-evolution.

  High-velocity outflows are ubiquitous in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon, but are not as common in passive galaxies at the same epoch. Using optical spectra of galaxies selected from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) at z &gt; 1, we perform a stacking analysis to investigate the transition in outflow properties along a quenching time sequence. To do this, we use MgII (2800 A) absorption profiles to investigate outflow properties as a function of time since the last major burst of star formation (tburst). We find evidence for high-velocity outflows in the star-forming progenitor population (vout ~ 1400 $\pm$ 210 km/s), for recently quenched galaxies with tburst &lt; 0.6 Gyr (vout ~ 990 $\pm$ 250 km/s), and for older quenched galaxies with 0.6 &lt; tburst &lt; 1 Gyr (vout ~ 1400 $\pm$ 220 km/s). The oldest galaxies (tburst &gt; 1 Gyr) show no evidence for significant outflows. Our samples show no signs of AGN in optical observations, suggesting that any AGN in these galaxies have very short duty cycles, and were 'off' when observed. The presence of significant outflows in the older quenched galaxies (tburst &gt; 0.6 Gyr) is difficult to explain with starburst activity, however, and may indicate energy input from episodic AGN activity as the starburst fades.

  Using early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we search for AGN signatures in 410,757 line-emitting galaxies. By employing the BPT emission-line ratio diagnostic diagram, we identify AGN in 75,928/296,261 ($\approx$25.6%) high-mass ($\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) &gt;$ 9.5) and 2,444/114,496 ($\approx$2.1%) dwarf ($\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) \leq$ 9.5) galaxies. Of these AGN candidates, 4,181 sources exhibit a broad H$\alpha$ component, allowing us to estimate their BH masses via virial techniques. This study more than triples the census of dwarf AGN as well as that of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; $M_{\rm BH} \le 10^6~\rm M_{\odot}$) candidates, spanning a broad discovery space in stellar mass (7 $&lt; \log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) &lt;$ 12) and redshift (0.001 $&lt; \rm z &lt;$ 0.45). The observed AGN fraction in dwarf galaxies ($\approx$2.1%) is nearly four times higher than prior estimates, primarily due to DESI's smaller fiber size, which enables the detection of lower luminosity dwarf AGN candidates. We also extend the $M_{\rm BH}$ - $M_{\star}$ scaling relation down to $\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) \approx$ 8.5 and $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) \approx$ 4.4, with our results aligning well with previous low-redshift studies. The large statistical sample of dwarf AGN candidates from current and future DESI releases will be invaluable for enhancing our understanding of galaxy evolution at the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function.
