  Using the CIGALE software, we present the preliminary results of a multiwavelength analysis of eighteen low-redshift isolated galaxies with active nuclei (isolated AGNs). This sample was formed by cross-matching the 2MIG isolated AGNs sample with the SDSS DR9 catalog. The host galaxies of this sample have not undergone a merger for at least three billion years, making them a unique laboratory for studying interactions between various astrophysical processes without the complicating factors of merging with other galaxies or the effects of a denser environment. In addition, the study of isolated AGNs can provide valuable information about the evolution and activity of galaxies in the broader context of the distribution of large-scale structures of the Universe. First, we seek to understand how the environment affects the physical processes involved in the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes in these galaxies. Secondly, to what extent do processes of star formation or degeneration of nuclei activity continue the evolution of these galaxies? Third, how does the localization of isolated AGNs in voids or filaments of a large-scale structure determine the properties of this environment at the low redshifts? Using observable fluxes from UV to the radio ranges from archival databases of space-born and ground-based observatories (GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer, Hershel, IRAS, WISE, VLA), we estimated the contribution from the emission of an active nucleus to the galaxy`s total emission, the stellar mass, and the star formation rate. The mass of the stellar component falls from $10^{10}$ $M_{Sun}$ and $10^{10}$ $M_{Sun}$. The star formation rate for most galaxies (except UGC10120) does not exceed 3 $M_{Sun}$ per year. The best SED fittings (with ${\chi}^2$ &lt; 5) are obtained for the galaxies CGCG248-019, CGCG179-005, CGCG243-024, IC0009, MCG+09-25-022, UGC10244.

  The sub/millimeter wavelengths (86-690 GHz) very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) will provide $\sim5-40\ \mu$as angular resolution, $\sim10$ mJy baseline sensitivity, and $\sim 1\ \mu$as/yr proper motion precision, which can directly detect supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) systems by imaging the two visible sources and tracking their relative motions. Such a way exhibits an advantage compared to indirect detect methods of observing periodic signals in motion and light curves, which are difficult to confirm from competing models. Moreover, tracking relative motion at sub/millimeter wavelengths is more reliable, as there is a negligible offset between the emission region and the black hole center. In this way, it is unnecessary to correct the black hole location by a prior of jet morphology as it would be required at longer wavelengths. We extend the formalism developed in D'Orazio &amp; Loeb (2018) to link the observations with the orbital evolution of SMBHBs from the $\lesssim$10 kpc dynamical friction stages to the $\lesssim 0.01$ pc gravitational radiation stages, and estimate the detectable numbers of SMBHBs. By assuming 5\% of AGNs holding SMBHBs, we find that the number of detectable SMBHBs with redshift $z\le 0.5$ and mass $M\leq 10^{11}M_\odot$ is about 20. Such detection relies heavily on proper motion precision and sensitivity. Furthermore, we propose that the simultaneous multi-frequency technique plays a key role in meeting the observational requirements.

  In this study, we examine photoionization outflows during the late stages of galaxy mergers, with a specific focus on the relation between observed velocity of outflowing gas and the apparent effects of dust extinction. We used the N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code ASURA for galaxy merger simulations. These simulations concentrated on identical galaxy mergers featuring supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of 10$^8$ M$_\odot$ and gas fractions of 30\% and 10 \%. From the simulation data, we derived velocity and velocity dispersion diagrams for the AGN-driven ionized outflowing gas. Our findings show that high-velocity outflows with velocity dispersions of 500 km s$^{-1}$ or greater can be observed in the late stages of galactic mergers. Particularly, in buried AGNs, both the luminosity-weighted outflow velocity and velocity dispersion increase owing to the apparent effects of dust extinction. Owing to these effects, the velocity--velocity dispersion diagrams display a noticeable blue-shifted tilt in models with higher gas fractions. Crucially, this tilt is not influenced by the AGN luminosity but emerges from the observational impacts of dust extinction. Our results imply that the observed high-velocity \OIII outflow exceeding 1000 km s$^{-1}$ in buried AGNs may be linked to the dust extinction that occurs during the late stages of gas-rich galaxy mergers.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) light curves observed with different wavebands show that the variability in longer wavelength bands lags the variability in shorter wavelength bands. Measuring these lags, or reverberation mapping, is used to measure the radial temperature profile and extent of AGN disks, typically with a reprocessing model that assumes X-rays are the main driver of the variability in other wavelength bands. To demonstrate how this reprocessing works with realistic accretion disk structures, we use 3D local shearing box multi-frequency radiation magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to model the UV-emitting region of an AGN disk, which is unstable to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and convection. At the same time, we inject hard X-rays ($&gt;1$~keV) into the simulation box to study the effects of X-ray irradiation on the local properties of the turbulence and the resulting variability of the emitted UV light curve. We find that disk turbulence is sufficient to drive intrinsic variability in emitted UV light curves and that a damped random walk (DRW) model is a good fit to this UV light curve for timescales $&gt;5$~days. Meanwhile, the injected X-rays have almost no impact on the power spectrum of the emitted UV light curve. In addition, the injected X-ray and emitted UV light curves are only correlated if there is X-ray variability on timescales $&gt;1$~day, in which case we find a correlation coefficient $r=0.52$. These results suggest that hard X-rays with scattering dominated opacity are likely not the main driver of the reverberation signals.
