  Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, red sources discovered by JWST at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$), marked by distinctive "V-shaped" spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their evolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is challenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed {\it the Saguaro}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS-North, as a possible analog of high-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path toward lower-redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus surrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1) its nuclear spectrum shows a clear "V-shaped" SED; and (2) when redshifted to $z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking an LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended hosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically selected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins reveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution. A simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can explain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that {\it the Saguaro} is not unique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\lesssim3.5$. Taken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a distinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a short-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red appearance driven largely by observational biases.

  Understanding galaxy classification depends on our interpretation of their spectra. To date, the hydrogen Balmer lines remain the most consistent way to classify galaxies, but at 'intermediate' redshifts ($1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$), galaxies are hard to parse in the BPT diagram (and its siblings) because the crucial H$\alpha$ emission line is out of range of ground-based optical spectographs. In this work, we re-explore a known diagram, which we call the OB-I diagram, that compares the equivalent width of H$\beta$ with the emission line ratio of [OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$, and breathe new life into it, as it has the potential to 'illuminate the fog' that permeates galaxy classification in the restframe optical spectra. Using data from SDSS, LEGA-C, VANDELS, JADES, 3D-HST and MOSDEF, we explore galaxy classification in the OB-I diagram at a wide range of redshifts ($0 &lt; z &lt; 2.7$). We find that, at $z &lt; 0.4$, the OB-I diagram clearly separates galaxies between two distinct types, which we divide with an empirical fit: one dominated by AGN and a second made up of a mixed population of SF galaxies and AGN activity. This mixed population can be partially separated from a pure SF population, with a simple semi-empirical fit derived from a comparison with theoretical models and the BPT diagrams. At higher redshifts, we find that the majority of AGNs identified by other classification schemes are correctly recovered by the OB-I diagram, potentially making this diagram resistant to the 'cosmic shift' that plagues most optical classification schemes. Overall, the OB-I diagram, which only requires two emission lines to be implemented, is a useful tool at separating galaxies that possess a dominating AGN component in their emission from others, from the Local Universe ($z &lt; 0.1$) to the Cosmic Noon ($z \sim 2$), without any need for significant adjustments in our empirical fit.

  Advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of early massive galaxies and black holes requires detailed studies of dense structures in the high-redshift Universe. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\simeq0.3''$) ALMA observations targeting the CO(4--3) line and the underlying 3-mm dust continuum toward the Cosmic Web node MQN01, a region identified through deep multiwavelength surveys as one of the densest concentrations of galaxies and AGN at cosmic noon. At the center of this structure, we identify a massive, rotationally supported disk galaxy located approximately at $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ projected-distance and $\sim-300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ from a hyperluminous quasar at $z=3.2510$. By accurately modeling the cold gas kinematics, we determine a galaxy dynamical mass of $2.5\times10^{11}\,{M_{\odot}}$ within the inner $\simeq 4\,{\rm kpc}$, and a high degree of rotational support of $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 11$. This makes it the first quasar companion galaxy confirmed as a massive, dynamically cold rotating disk at such an early cosmic epoch. Despite the small projected separation from the quasar host, we find no clear evidence of strong tidal interactions affecting the galaxy disk. This might suggest that the quasar is a satellite galaxy in the early stages of a merger. Furthermore, our spectroscopic analysis reveals a broad, blueshifted component in the CO(4--3) line profile of the quasar host, which may trace a powerful molecular outflow or kinematic disturbances induced by its interaction with the massive companion galaxy. Our findings show that rotationally supported cold disks are able to survive even in high-density environments of the early Universe.

  Recent surveys show that $z&gt;2$ quasars are surrounded by Hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) glows with diverse emission levels and extents. These seem to depend on the activity of embedded quasars, the number of active galactic nucleus (AGN) photons able to reach the halo gas or circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the physical properties of the CGM. In this framework, we present VLT/MUSE snapshot observations (45 min/source) of 59 $z\sim3$ quasars extending the long-term QSO MUSEUM campaign to fainter SDSS sources. The whole survey now targets 120 quasars with a median redshift of $z$=3.13, and bolometric luminosities, black hole masses and Eddington ratios of $45.1&lt;\log(L_{\rm bol}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}]})&lt;48.7$, $7.9&lt;\log(M_{\rm BH}/[{\rm M_{\odot}]})&lt;10.3 $ and $0.01&lt;\lambda_{\rm Edd}&lt;1.8$, respectively. We detect extended Ly$\alpha$ emission in 110/120 systems, with all non-detections in the new fainter sample. Stacking non-detections unveils emission below our individual detection limit. The Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness (SB$_{\rm Ly\alpha}$) of the CGM increases with quasar luminosity. Moreover, the Ly$\alpha$ linewidth increases in the central regions (projected radius $R&lt;40$ kpc or $\sim$40% $R_{\rm vir}$) of the CGM around brighter quasars. These trends indicate that we are witnessing the instantaneous AGN feedback in action on CGM scales. Assuming that all targeted quasars sit in halos of $M_{\rm DM}\sim10^{12.5}\,M_\odot$, as found in clustering studies, the trend in SB$_{\rm Ly\alpha}$ can be explained by larger fractions of cool gas mass illuminated, implying that brighter quasars have larger ionization cone opening angles. Similarly, brighter AGNs seem to perturb the cool ($T\sim10^4$ K) gas more strongly. We show that QSO MUSEUM now has enough statistics to study the instantaneous AGN feedback while controlling for black hole properties, which are key to constraining AGN models.
