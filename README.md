  Even over relatively recent epochs, galaxies have evolved significantly in their location in the mass-metallicity plane, which must be telling us something about the latter stages of galaxy evolution. In this paper, we analyse data from the LEGA-C survey using semi-analytic spectral and photometric fitting to determine these galaxies' evolution up to their observed epoch at $z \sim 0.7$. We confirm that, at $z \sim 0.7$, many objects already lie on the present-day mass-metallicity relation, but with a significant tail of high-mass low-metallicity galaxies that is not seen in the nearby Universe. Similar modelling of the evolution of galaxies in the nearby MaNGA survey allows us to reconstruct their properties at $z \sim 0.7$. Once selection criteria similar to those of LEGA-C are applied, we reassuringly find that the MaNGA galaxies populate the mass-metallicity plane in the same way at $z \sim 0.7$. Matching the LEGA-C sample to their mass-metallicity "twins" in MaNGA at this redshift, we can explore the likely subsequent evolution of individual LEGA-C galaxies. Galaxies already on the present-day mass--metallicity relation form few more stars and their disks fade, so they become smaller and more bulge-like. By contrast, the high-mass low-metallicity galaxies grow their disks through late star formation, and evolve rapidly to higher metallicities due to a cut-off in their wind-driven mass loss. There are significant indications that this late cut-off is associated with the belated end of strong AGN activity in these objects.

  An electron-positron cascade in the magnetospheres of Kerr Black Holes (BH) is a fundamental ingredient to fueling the relativistic $\gamma$-ray jets seen at the polar regions of galactic supermassive BHs (SMBH). This leptonic cascade occurs in the "spark gap" region of a BH magnetosphere where the unscreen electric field parallel to the magnetic field is present, hence it is affected by the magnetic field structure. A previous study explored the case of a thin accretion disk, representative of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Here we explore the case of a quasi-spherical gas distribution, as is expected to be present around the SMBH Sgr A* in the center of our Milky Way galaxy, for example. The properties and efficiency of the leptonic cascade are studied. The findings of our study and the implications for SMBH systems in various spectral and accretion states are discussed. The relationships and scalings derived from varying the mass of the BH and background photon spectra are further used to analyze the leptonic cascade process to power jets seen in astronomical observations. In particular, one finds the efficiency of the cascade in a quasi-spherical gas distribution peaks at the jet axis. Observationally, this should lead to a more prominent jet core, in contrast to the thin disk accretion case, where it peaks around the jet-disk interface. One also finds the spectrum of the background photons to play a key role. The cascade efficiency is maximum for a spectral index of two, while harder and softer spectra lead to a less efficient cascade.

  Symbolic regression (SR) is a regression analysis based on genetic algorithms to search for mathematical expressions that best fit a given data set, by allowing the expressions themselves to mutate. We use the SR to analyze the parameter relations of the X-ray reverberating Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) where the soft Fe-L lags were observed by XMM-Newton. Firstly, we revisit the lag-mass scaling relations by using the SR to derive all possible mathematical expressions and test them in terms of accuracy, simplicity and robustness. We find that the correlation between the lags, $\tau$, and the black hole mass, $M_{\rm BH}$, is certain, but the relation should be written in the form of $\log ({\tau}) = \alpha + \beta (\log{(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot})})^{\gamma}$, where $1 \lesssim \gamma \lesssim 2$. Moreover, incorporating more parameters such as the reflection fraction ($RF$) and the Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) to the lag-mass scaling relation is made possible by the SR. It reveals that $\alpha$, rather than being a constant, can be $-2.15 + 0.02RF$ or $0.03(RF + \lambda_{\rm Edd})$, with the fine-tuned different $\beta$ and $\gamma$. These further support the relativistic disc-reflection framework in which such functional dependencies can be straightforwardly explained. Furthermore, we derive their host-galaxy mass, $M_{\ast}$, by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED). We find that the SR model supports a non-linear $M_{\rm BH}$--$M_{\ast}$ relationship, while $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\ast})$ varies between $-5.4$ and $-1.5$, with an average value of $\sim -3.7$. No significant correlation between $M_{\ast}$ and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ is confirmed in these samples.

  We study AGN line driven disc winds using time-dependent radiation hydrodynamics. The key criterion for determining wind launching is the coupling strength of the UV radiation field via the spectral lines of the gas. The strength of these lines in turn relies crucially on the gas ionization state, determined by the local X-ray intensity. We consider a suite of models where the central ionizing radiation is affected by scattering, absorption and re-emission by the intervening gas. In a pure attenuation model, the disc launches an episodic wind, as previous studies have shown. Including scattering or re-emission tends to weaken the wind, lowering the mass flux and outflow velocity and if sufficiently dominant, suppressing the outflow entirely. However, the exponential nature of radiative attenuation means only a modest, factor of a few, increase in the absorption cross section can overcome the wind suppression due to scattering and re-emission. We find mass outflow rates of $\sim 20\%$ or more of the assumed inflow rate through the disk, indicating that radiation driven winds may significantly alter the structure of the accretion flow. The winds also supply a large, time-varying column of material above the nominal constant disk scale height, which will determine the geometry of reprocessed emission from the central source. Our results suggest the need for accurate photoionization modeling, radiation transport as well as accretion disc physics, to study their effects on the AGN disc winds   

Shock cooling and breakout emission for optical flares associated with

  The astrophysical origin of stellar-mass black hole (BH) mergers discovered through gravitational waves (GWs) is widely debated. Mergers in the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent promising environments for at least a fraction of these events, with possible observational clues in the GW data. An additional clue to unveil AGN merger environments is provided by possible electromagnetic emission from post-merger accreting BHs. Associated with BH mergers in AGN disks, emission from shocks emerging around jets launched by accreting merger remnants is expected. In this paper we compute the properties of the emission produced during breakout and the subsequent adiabatic expansion phase of the shocks, and we then apply this model to optical flares suggested to be possibly associated with GW events. We find that the majority of the reported flares can be explained by the breakout and the shock cooling emission. If these events are real, then the merging locations of binaries are constrained depending on the emission processes. If the optical flares are produced by shock cooling emission, they would display moderate color evolution, possibly color variations among different events, a positive correlation between the delay time and the duration of flares, and accompanying breakout emission in X-ray bands before the optical flares. If the breakout emission dominates the observed lightcurve, it is expected that the color is distributed in a narrow range in the optical band, and the delay time from GW to electromagnetic emission is longer than $\sim 2$ days. Hence, further explorations of the distributions of delay times, color evolution of the flares, and associated X-ray emission will be useful to test the proposed emission model for the observed flares.
