  The radio-quiet quasar SDSS J1240+1455 lies at a redshift of z=3.11, is surrounded by a Ly-alpha blob (LAB), and is absorbed by a proximate damped Ly-alpha system. In order to better define the morphology of the blob and determine its emission mechanism, we gathered deep narrow-band images isolating the Ly-alpha line of this object in linearly polarized light. We provide a deep intensity image of the blob, showing a filamentary structure extending up to 16'' (or ~122 physical kpc) in diameter. No significant polarization signal could be extracted from the data, but 95% probability upper limits were defined through simulations. They vary between ~3% in the central 0.75'' disk (after subtraction of the unpolarized quasar continuum) and ~10% in the 3.8-5.5'' annulus. The low polarization suggests that the Ly-alpha photons are emitted mostly in situ, by recombination and de-excitation in a gas largely ionized by the quasar ultraviolet light, rather than by a central source and scattered subsequently by neutral hydrogen gas. This blob shows no detectable polarization signal, contrary to LAB1, a brighter and more extended blob that is not related to the nearby active galactic nucleus (AGN) in any obvious way, and where a significant polarization signal of about 18% was detected.

  In recent years, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have proven their utility as key interpretative tools in the study of galaxy formation and evolution. In this work, we present a like-for-like comparison between the baryon cycle in three publicly available, leading cosmological simulation suites: EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA. While these simulations broadly agree in terms of their predictions for the stellar mass content and star formation rates of galaxies at $z\approx0$, they achieve this result for markedly different reasons. In EAGLE and SIMBA, we demonstrate that at low halo masses ($M_{\rm 200c}\lesssim 10^{11.5}\, M_{\odot}$), stellar feedback (SF)-driven outflows can reach far beyond the scale of the halo, extending up to $2-3\times R_{\rm 200c}$. In contrast, in TNG, SF-driven outflows, while stronger at the scale of the ISM, recycle within the CGM (within $R_{\rm 200c}$). We find that AGN-driven outflows in SIMBA are notably potent, reaching several times $R_{\rm 200c}$ even at halo masses up to $M_{\rm 200c}\approx10^{13.5}\, M_{\odot}$. In both TNG and EAGLE, AGN feedback can eject gas beyond $R_{\rm 200c}$ at this mass scale, but seldom beyond $2-3\times R_{\rm 200c}$. We find that the scale of feedback-driven outflows can be directly linked with the prevention of cosmological inflow, as well as the total baryon fraction of haloes within $R_{\rm 200c}$. This work lays the foundation to develop targeted observational tests that can discriminate between feedback scenarios, and inform sub-grid feedback models in the next generation of simulations.

  We present a focused study of radially-resolved varying PAH emission in the low-luminosity AGN-host NGC 4138 using deep Spitzer/IRS spectral maps. Using new model PAH spectra, we investigate whether these variations could be associated with changes to the PAH grain size distribution due to photodestruction by the AGN. Separately, we model the effects of the varying radiation field within NGC 4138, and we use this model to predict the corresponding changes in the PAH emission spectrum. We find that PAH band ratios are strongly variable with radius in this galaxy with short-to-long wavelength band ratios peaking in the starburst ring. The changing mix of starlight appears to have a considerable effect on the trends in these band ratios, and our radiation model predicts the shapes of these trends. However, the amplitude of observed variation is ~2.5 times larger than predicted for some ratios. A cutoff of small grains in the PAH size distribution, as has been suggested for AGN, together with changes in PAH ionization fraction could explain the behavior of the shorter bands, but this model fails to reproduce longer band behaviors. Additionally, we find that short-to-long wavelength PAH band ratios increase slightly within ~270pc of the center, suggesting that the AGN may directly influence PAH emission there.

  This paper utilizes the JWST MIRI multi-band imaging data from the SMILES survey (5-25micron), complemented with HST and NIRCam photometric and spectroscopic data from the JADES and FRESCO surveys for 443 star-forming (non-AGN) galaxies at z=0.7-2.0 to extend the study of dust and PAH emission to a new mass and SFR parameter space beyond our local universe. We find a strong correlation between the fraction of dust in PAHs (PAH fraction, q_PAH) with stellar mass. Moreover, the PAH fraction behavior as a function of gas-phase metallicity is similar to that at z~0 from previous studies, suggesting a universal relation: q_PAH is constant (~3.4%) above a metallicity of ~ 0.5$Z_{\odot}$ and decreases to &lt;1% at metallicities $&lt;0.3Z_{\odot}$. This indicates that metallicity is a good indicator of the ISM properties that affect the balance between the formation and destruction of PAHs. The lack of a redshift evolution from z~0-2 also implies that above $0.5\,Z_{\odot}$, the PAH emission effectively traces obscured luminosity and the previous locally-calibrated PAH-SFR calibrations remain applicable in this metallicity regime. We observe a strong correlation between obscured UV luminosity fraction (ratio of obscured to total luminosity) and stellar mass. Above the stellar mass of $&gt;5\times 10^9M_{\odot}$, on average, more than half of the emitted luminosity is obscured, while there exists a non-negligible population of lower mass galaxies with &gt;50% obscured fractions. At a fixed mass, the obscured fraction correlates with SFR surface density. This is a result of higher dust covering fractions in galaxies with more compact star forming regions. Similarly, galaxies with high IRX (IR to UV luminosity) at a given mass or UV continuum slope tend to have higher SFR surface density and shallower attenuation curves, owing to their higher effective dust optical depths and more compact star forming regions.
