  S-shaped radio galaxy jets are prime sources for investigating the dynamic interplay between the central active galactic nucleus, the jets, and the ambient intergalactic medium. These sources are excellent candidates for studying jet precession, as their S-shaped inversion symmetry strongly indicates underlying precession. We present a multiwavelength analysis of the giant inversion-symmetric S-shaped radio galaxy PKS 2300-18, which spans 0.76 Mpc. The host is a quasar at a redshift of 0.128, displaying disturbed optical morphology due to an ongoing merger with a companion galaxy. We conducted a broadband radio spectral study using multifrequency data ranging from 183 MHz to 6 GHz, incorporating dedicated observations with the uGMRT and JVLA alongside archival radio data. A particle injection model was fitted to the spectra of different regions of the source to perform ageing analysis, which was supplemented with a kinematic jet precession model. The ageing analysis revealed a maximum plasma age of ~ 40 Myr, while the jet precession model indicated a precession period of ~ 12 Myr. ROSAT data revealed an X-ray halo of Mpc size, and from Chandra the AGN X-ray spectrum was modelled using thermal and power-law components. The optical spectrum displaying double-peaked broad emission lines was modelled, indicating complex broad-line region kinematics at the centre with the possibility of a binary SMBH. We present the results of our multiwavelength analysis of the source, spanning scales from a few light-days to a few Mpc, and discuss its potential evolutionary path.

  To study the role of the feedback from the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in the evolution of its host galaxy, we need observational constraints on 100 pc scales. We used the Gemini Near Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph in the J and K bands at a spatial resolution of 100 pc and spectral resolution of 45 km\,s$^{-1}$ to observe the central region of the Seyfert galaxy NGC1125. Emission-line flux distributions in ionized and molecular gas extends up to $\approx$ 300\,pc from the nucleus, where they are found to peak. The Pa$\beta$ and [Fe\,{\sc ii}]$\lambda$1.2570$\mu$m emission-lines show two components: a narrow and a broad. The narrow component is preferably extended from the north-east to the south-west, while the broad component is perpendicular to it. Their kinematics are also different, with the narrow component showing a rotation pattern, with low velocity dispersion values ($\sigma$ $\approx$ 140 km s$^{-1}$) and the broad component a disturbed velocity field and high values of $\sigma$ ($\approx$ 250 km s$^{-1}$). We interpreted the narrow component velocity fields as due to gas rotating in the galaxy plane and fitted rotation velocity models to it, plus an outflow component in the ionized gas. The broad component is interpreted as an outflow, with mass outflow rate in the range of 0.6 to 1.1 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, with an outflow power ranging from 3.9$\times$10$^{40}$ to 1.1$\times$10$^{41}$ erg\,s$^{-1}$, which represents 0.07\% and 0.2\% of the bolometric luminosity of the AGN. There is an explicit relation between the shock ionized outflow and the low-luminosity radio source.

  The relationship between an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and its host galaxy is still far from being understood. Properties of the host galaxies of Seyfert nuclei, such as luminosity concentration, morphological type, metallicity, and age of the stellar population are expected to be related with nuclear activity -- either at the epoch of galaxy formation or in the present days via feeding of the central black-hole. In this paper we investigate whether stellar ages and metallicities are linked to the activity within the nucleus in a sample of AGN of various types. Our sample includes seven AGN, from Seyfert 1 to LINERs, observed with VLT/ISAAC and VLT/SINFONI. Based on an inverse method using a stellar library, we analyse H band infrared spectra, in a wavelength region devoid of emission lines, at a spectral resolution of about 3000, in the central few 100 pc. HST images are used to visualise the regions defined in each galaxy. For each galaxy, we give the results of the spectral synthesis, in particular the percentages of the stellar, power law and blackbody continua, and the percentages of various stellar types that account for the stellar lines. Out of the seven galaxies, three show strong and recent star formation in the inner 100 pc, while no star formation is detected in the three genuine Seyfert 2 galaxies. Beyond a radius of 100 pc, all show more or less recent star formation. Moreover we can conclude that the star formation history of the inner nucleus is highly heterogeneous.

  We present [NII] 205 $\mu$m fine structure line observations of three submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and three quasar host galaxies at 4$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$6 using the Institut de radioastronomie millim\'etrique (IRAM) interferometer. The [NII] emission is detected in three sources, and we report detections of the underlying dust continuum emission in all sources. The observed [NII]-to-infrared luminosity ratio spans at least 0.5 dex for our sources. Comparing our estimates with sources detected in the [NII] 205 $\mu$m at similar redshifts shows that the overall [NII]-to-IR luminosity ratio spans over a dex in magnitude from L$_{[NII]}$/L$_{IR}$ ~ 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-5}$ and follows the trend of the so-called [NII] fine structure line deficit observed in (ultra)-luminous infrared galaxies in the local Universe. The [CII]-to-[NII] luminosity ratio is &gt;10 for most of our sources, indicating that the bulk of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m line emission (f([CII]$^{PDR}$)&gt;75%) arises from the neutral medium. From our analysis, we do not find significant differences in the [NII] 205 $\mu$m emission and the respective ratios between SMGs and QSOs, suggesting a negligible contribution to the boosting of [NII] 205 $\mu$m emission due to the active galactic nucleus (AGN) photoionization. Future investigations involving other fine structure lines and optical diagnostics will provide further insight into a suite of ionized medium properties and reveal the diversity between AGN and non-AGN environments.

  We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of $169$ galaxies at $z\sim10-16$ with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii $r_{\rm e}$ ranging $20-500$ pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the $r_{\rm e}$ distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of $r_{\rm e}=133^{+13}_{-12}$ pc and a standard deviation of $\sigma_{{\rm ln}r_{\rm e}} = 0.52 \pm 0.08$. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over $z\sim 0-10$. We estimate the virial radius $r_{\rm vir}$ from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio $r_{\rm e}/r_{\rm vir} = 0.015^{+0.015}_{-0.005}$, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-$z$ Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal $r_{\rm e}$ distribution, 2) the standard deviation value, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile ($n=1.3\pm0.6$) suggest that galaxies at $z\sim10-16$ generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of $j_{\rm d} / m_{\rm d} \sim 0.5-1$. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 ($z_{\rm spec}=10.60$) and GHZ2 ($z_{\rm spec}=12.34$) with $r_{\rm e}=55^{+5}_{-6}$ pc and $39\pm11$ pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.   

The Bulk Motion of Gas in the Core of the Centaurus Galaxy Cluster

  Galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe, contain vast amounts of dark matter, galaxies, and hot ionised gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the ICM appears to cool radiatively faster than the age of the cluster, but the absence of line emission from the predicted cooling rate suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (``sloshing'') motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for the distribution of heat from the outside of the core. Here we present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of the core of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the XRISM satellite. We find that the hot gas is streaming along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy (NGC 4696), with relative velocities varying from 130 km/s to 310 km/s within ~ 30 kpc of the centre, indicating a structured bulk flow ("wind") blowing in the core. This wind is consistent with the core gas sloshing. While the wind may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre of the cluster, it could also distribute the heat injected by the central AGN and/or bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM, thus contributing to the thermal balance at the cluster centre. The velocity dispersion (turbulent velocity) of the gas is found to be only ~&lt; 120 km/s (corresponding to a Mach number M ~&lt; 0.2) in the core, even within ~ 10 kpc of the AGN. This may indicate that the influence of the AGN on the motion of the surrounding ICM is limited in the Centaurus cluster.

  The main fuelling processes for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are currently unknown. Previous work showed that galaxies with a large kinematic misalignment between their stellar and gas reservoirs have a higher AGN fraction than galaxies without misalignment. Such misalignment is a strong indication of a past galaxy interaction or an external accretion event. In this work we use integral field spectroscopy data from the SAMI and MaNGA surveys to investigate the AGN luminosity as a function of kinematic misalignment angle. Our sample of AGN exhibit bolometric luminosities in the range 10^40 to 10^43 erg/s, indicative of low to moderate luminosity AGN. We find no correlation between AGN luminosity as a function of misalignment for AGN host galaxies from both surveys. We find some differences between the AGN luminosity of early- and late-type AGN host galaxies (ETGs, LTGs). AGN in LTG hosts have a wider luminosity range, with most LTG hosts showing aligned stellar to gas kinematics. AGN in ETG hosts have a luminosity range that does not depend on misalignment angle, suggesting AGN in ETG hosts are consistent with being fuelled by external accretion events, irrespective of their stellar to gas kinematic misalignment. While all the AGN in ETGs in our sample are consistent with being activated and fuelled by external gas, the range of observed AGN luminosities is likely caused by secondary factors such as the amount of fresh gas brought into the galaxy by the external interaction.
