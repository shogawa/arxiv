  We present a study of X-ray normal galaxies using data from the first all-sky scan of the eROSITA X-ray survey. eRASS1 provides the first unbiased X-ray census of normal galaxies allowing us to study the X-ray emission from XRBs and the hot ISM in the full range of stellar population parameters present in the local Universe. By combining the HECATE value-added galaxy catalogue with the eRASS1, we study the X-ray emission from normal galaxies as a function of their SFR, M$_{*}$, Metallicity, and stellar population age. After applying optical and mid-IR activity classification criteria, we constructed a sample of 18790 star-forming galaxies with measurements of their L$_{X}$. By stacking the X-ray data in SFR-M$_{*}$-distance bins we study the correlation between the average L$_{X}$ and stellar population parameters. We also present updated L$_{\rm{X}}$-SFR and L$_{\rm{X}}$/SFR-Metallicity scaling relations accounting for the scatter dependence on the SFR. We find that the integrated L$_{X}$ of the HEC-eR1 star-forming galaxies is significantly elevated with respect to that expected from the current scaling relations. The observed scatter is also significantly larger. This excess persists even when we measure the average L$_{X}$ of galaxies in SFR-M$_{*}$-distance and metallicity bins and it is stronger in lower SFRs. The excess is not the result of hot gas, LMXBs, background AGN, LLAGN (including TDEs), or stochastic sampling of the XRB XLF. We find that while the excess correlates with lower metallicity, its primary driver is the age of the stellar populations. Our analysis reveals a sub-population of X-ray luminous starbursts with high sSFRs, low metallicities, and young stellar populations. This population drives upwards the X-ray scaling relations for star-forming galaxies, and has important implications for understanding the population of XRBs in the local and high-z Universe.

  Sizes of narrow emission line regions (NLRs) of AGN could be estimated by [O~{\sc iii}] line luminosity $L_{O3}$ through the known $R_{NLRs}-L_{O3}$ empirical relations. Unfortunately, it is not convenient to test the $R_{NLRs}-L_{O3}$ empirical relations through structure properties of spatially resolved NLRs of large samples of AGN. In this manuscript, a method is proposed to test the $R_{NLRs}-L_{O3}^{\sim0.25}$ empirical relations for AGN NLRs through SDSS Type-2 AGN having few orientation effects on NLRs sizes expected by AGN unified model, after considering sizes $R_{fib}$ of SDSS fiber covered regions. Comparing $R_{fib}$ and $R_{NLRs}$ estimated by $L_{O3}$, Type-2 AGN with $R_{fib}&gt;R_{NLRs}$ (Sample-II) and with $R_{fib}&lt;R_{NLRs}$ (Sample-I) should have different physical properties of NLRs. Accepted electron density gradients in AGN NLRs, statistically higher electron densities (traced by lower flux ratio $R_{S2}$ of [S~{\sc ii}]$\lambda6717$\AA~ to [S~{\sc ii}]$\lambda6731$\AA) could be expected for the Type-2 AGN in the Sample-I. Then, through the collected 1062 SDSS Type-2 AGN in the Sample-I and 3658 SDSS Type-2 AGN in the Sample-II, statistically lower $R_{S2}$ for the Type-2 AGN in the Sample-I can be confirmed with confidence level higher than 5$\sigma$, even after considering necessary effects. Therefore, the results in this manuscript can provide strong clues to support that the reported $R_{NLRs}~\propto~L_{O3}^{0.25}$ empirical relation is preferred to estimate NLRs sizes of SDSS AGN through SDSS fiber spectroscopic results, and also to support the commonly expected electron density gradients in AGN NLRs.

  NGC 1566 is known for exhibiting recurrent outbursts, which are accompanied by changes in spectral type. The most recent transient event occurred from 2017 to 2019 and was reported to be accompanied by a change in Seyfert classification from Seyfert 1.8 to Seyfert 1.2. We analyze data from an optical spectroscopic variability campaign of NGC 1566 taken with the 9.2m SALT between July 2018 and October 2019 and supplement our data set with optical to near-infrared spectroscopic archival data taken by VLT/MUSE in September 2015 and October 2017. We observe the emergence and fading of a strong power-law-like blue continuum as well as strong variations in the Balmer, HeI, HeII lines and the coronal lines [FeVII], [FeX] and [FeXI]. Moreover, we detect broad double-peaked emission line profiles of OI 8446 and the CaII 8498,8542,8662 triplet. This is the first time that genuine double-peaked OI 8446 and CaII 8498,8542,8662 emission in AGN is reported in the literature. All broad lines show a clear redward asymmetry with respect to their central wavelength and we find indications for a significant blueward drift of the total line profiles during the transient event. We show that the double-peaked emission line profiles are well approximated by emission from a low-inclination, relativistic eccentric accretion disk, and that single-peaked profiles can be obtained by broadening due to scale-height dependent turbulence. Small-scale features in the OI and CaII lines suggest the presence of inhomogeneities in the broad-line region. We conclude that the broad-line region in NGC 1566 is dominated by the kinematics of a relativistic eccentric accretion disk. The broad-line region can be modeled to be vertically stratified with respect to scale-height turbulence. The observed blueward drift might be attributed to a low-optical-depth wind launched during the transient event.

  We propose a new method for identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) in low mass ($\rm M_*\leq10^{10}M_\odot$) galaxies. This method relies on spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to identify galaxies whose radio flux density has an excess over that expected from star formation alone. Combining data in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) G23 region from GAMA, Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) early science observations, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we compare this technique with a selection of different AGN diagnostics to explore the similarities and differences in AGN classification. We find that diagnostics based on optical and near-infrared criteria (the standard BPT diagram, the WISE colour criterion, and the mass-excitation, or MEx diagram) tend to favour detection of AGN in high mass, high luminosity systems, while the ``ProSpect'' SED fitting tool can identify AGN efficiently in low mass systems. We investigate an explanation for this result in the context of proportionally lower mass black holes in lower mass galaxies compared to higher mass galaxies and differing proportions of emission from AGN and star formation dominating the light at optical and infrared wavelengths as a function of galaxy stellar mass. We conclude that SED-derived AGN classification is an efficient approach to identify low mass hosts with low radio luminosity AGN.

  While stellar processes are believed to be the main source of feedback in dwarf galaxies, the accumulating discoveries of AGN in dwarf galaxies over recent years arouse the interest to also consider AGN feedback in them. Fast, AGN-driven outflows, a major mechanism of AGN feedback, have indeed been discovered in dwarf galaxies and may be powerful enough to provide feedback to their dwarf hosts. In this paper, we search for outflows traced by the blueshifted ultraviolet absorption features in three dwarf galaxies with AGN from the sample examined in our previous ground-based study. We confirm outflows traced by blueshifted absorption features in two objects and tentatively detect an outflow in the third object. In one object where the outflow is clearly detected in multiple species, photoionization modeling suggests that this outflow is located $\sim$0.5 kpc from the AGN, implying a galactic-scale impact. This outflow is much faster and possesses higher kinetic energy outflow rate than starburst-driven outflows in sources with similar star formation rates, and is likely energetic enough to provide negative feedback to its host galaxy as predicted by simulations. Much broader ($\sim$4000 km s$^{-1}$) absorption features are also discovered in this object which may have the same origin as that of broad absorption lines in quasars. Additionally, strong He II $\lambda$1640 emission is detected in both objects where the transition falls in the wavelength coverage, and is consistent with an AGN origin. In one of these two objects, blueshifted He II emission line is clearly detected, likely tracing a highly-ionized AGN wind.

  Herein, we present the statistical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for approximately 1 million member galaxies of galaxy groups and clusters, with 0.1 $&lt;$ cluster redshift ($z_{\rm cl}$) $&lt;$ 1.4, selected using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam, the so-called CAMIRA clusters. In this research, we focused on the AGN power fraction ($f_{\rm AGN}$), which is defined as the proportion of the contribution of AGNs to the total infrared (IR) luminosity, $L_{\rm IR}$ (AGN)/$L_{\rm IR}$, and examined how $f_{\rm AGN}$ depends on (i) $z_{\rm cl}$ and (ii) the distance from the cluster center. We compiled multiwavelength data using the ultraviolet--mid-IR range. Moreover, we performed spectral energy distribution fits to determine $f_{\rm AGN}$ using the CIGALE code with the SKIRTOR AGN model. We found that (i) the value of $f_{\rm AGN}$ in the CAMIRA clusters is positively correlated with $z_{\rm cl}$, with the correlation slope being steeper than that for field galaxies, and (ii) $f_{\rm AGN}$ exhibits a high value at the cluster outskirts. These results indicate that the emergence of AGN population depends on the redshift and environment and that galaxy groups and clusters at high redshifts are important in AGN evolution. Additionally, we demonstrated that cluster--cluster mergers may enhance AGN activity at the outskirts of particularly massive galaxy clusters. Our findings are consistent with a related study on the CAMIRA clusters that was based on the AGN number fraction.
