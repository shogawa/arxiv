  Massive stars can form within or be captured by AGN disks, influencing both the thermal structure and metallicity of the disk environment. In a previous work, we investigated isotropic accretion onto massive stars from a gas-rich, high-entropy background. Here, we consider a more realistic scenario by incorporating the stratified geometry of the background disk in our 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulatons. We find that accretion remains relatively isotropic when the disk is hot enough and the scale height is thicker than the accretion flow's nominal supersonic critical radius $R{crit}$ (sub-thermal). However, when the disk becomes cold, the accretion flow becomes significantly anisotropic (super-thermal). Escaping stellar and accretion luminosity can drive super-Eddington outflows in the polar region, while rapid accretion is sustained along the midplane. Eventually, the effective cross-section is constrained by the Hill radius and the disk scale height rather than the critical radius when the disk is cold enough. For our setup (stellar mass $\sim 50 M\odot$ and background density $\rho\sim 10^{-10}$ g/cm$^3$) the accretion rates is capped below $\sim 0.02M\odot$/year and the effective accretion parameter $\alpha\sim 10^{-1}$ over disk temperature range $3 - 7 \times 10^4$ K. Spiral arms facilitate inward mass flux by driving outward angular momentum transport. Gap-opening effects may further reduce the long-term accretion rate, albeit to confirm which requires global simulations evolved over much longer viscous timescales.

  Recent studies of individual track-like TeV-PeV IceCube neutrino events suggest that strongly jetted AGNs, blazars, can be plausible sources of extragalactic high-energy neutrinos. Although the broadband emission and neutrinos from such blazars can be modeled by hadronic jets with inverse Compton processes, various models show degeneracies. One of the reasons is the lack of high-resolution observations pinpointing the location and physical conditions of neutrino-emitting plasma. Here, we present a VLBI study of PKS 0735+178 that was recently associated with a high energy neutrino event IceCube-211208A (IC211208) as well as alerts from other neutrino observatories. We analyzed publicly available VLBA 15 and 43 GHz data of 0735+178 during 2020-2024, resolving the mas-scale jet and tracing its time evolution in flux and structure, before and after IC211208. We find significant enhancements in the radio flux density, apparent brightness temperature, and synchrotron opacity at 15-43 GHz of the VLBI nuclear region after IC211208, strengthening the temporal correlation between 0735+178 and IC211208. Furthermore, we find that the source ejected a new VLBI component C2 from the VLBI core before IC211208. C2 traveled further downstream at ~4.2c apparent speed, close to the historical maximum speed for this object. C2 then passed a subluminally moving feature in the jet C1 located at ~0.13 mas (~0.77 pc) downstream the core at the time of IC211208. The time of this apparent passage is statistically coincident with the time of IC211208 within 1sigma uncertainty, suggesting the location of this apparent passage to be a probable spatial origin of IC211208. We discuss the physical implications of these findings.

  Enigma of Its Unexpected Supermassive Black Hole Growth

  There is general consensus that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) derive their radiating power from a supermassive black hole (SMBH) that accretes matter. Yet, their precise powering mechanisms and the resulting growth of the SMBH are poorly understood, especially for AGNs at high redshift. Blazars are AGNs pointing their jet toward the observer, thus being detectable from radio through gamma rays at high redshift due to Doppler boosting. The blazar MG3 J163554+3629 is located at redshift z=3.65 and it is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ). In this work, we show the results of the modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to gamma rays with a one-zone leptonic model. We estimate the uncertainties through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. As a result, we infer the black hole mass M_BH = 1.1(+0.2,-0.1) x 10^9 Msun and a modest magnetic field of B = 6.56(+0.13,-0.09) x 10^-2 G in line with the Compton dominance observed in high-redshift FSRQs. The emitting region is outside the broad line region but within the region of the dust torus radius. The rather small accretion efficiency of eta=0.083 is not solely inferred through the SED modeling but also through the energetics. An evolution study suggests that in an Eddington-limited accretion process the SMBH did not have time enough to grow from an initial seed mass of ~10^6 Msun at z~30 into a mass of M_BH ~ 10^9 Msun at z=3.65. Faster mass growth might be obtained in a super-Eddington process throughout frequent episodes. Alternative scenarios propose that the existence of the jet itself can facilitate a more rapid growth.

  The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas ($N_{\rm H}\sim10^{24}\,\rm cm^{-2}$). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date ($L_{\rm H\alpha}\approx10^{44}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at $z=4.464$ ($\mu=1.8$). We detect a moderately extended Ly$\alpha$ nebula ($h\approx5.7$ pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H$\alpha$ seen by JWST. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is narrow ($\rm FWHM=270\pm 15~km\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$\alpha$, and faint ($\rm Ly\alpha=0.07H\alpha$) compared to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N$\,$IV]$\lambda$1486 emission, spatially aligned with H$\alpha$, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly$\alpha$ offset. We discuss that H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ have distinct physical origins: H$\alpha$ originates from the AGN, while Ly$\alpha$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$\alpha$ halos ($\Delta z&lt;0.02$, $\Delta r&lt;100$ pkpc). Their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities match expectations based on H$\alpha$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly$\alpha$ and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.
