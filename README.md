  Robust inference of galaxy stellar masses from photometry is crucial for constraints on galaxy assembly across cosmic time. Here, we test a commonly-used Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code, using simulated galaxies from the SPHINX20 cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation, with JWST NIRCam photometry forward-modelled with radiative transfer. Fitting the synthetic photometry with various star formation history models, we show that recovered stellar masses are, encouragingly, generally robust to within a factor of ~3 for galaxies in the range M*~10^7-10^9M_sol at z=5-10. These results are in stark contrast to recent work claiming that stellar masses can be underestimated by as much as an order of magnitude in these mass and redshift ranges. However, while &gt;90% of masses are recovered to within 0.5dex, there are notable systematic trends, with stellar masses typically overestimated for low-mass galaxies (M*&lt;~10^8M_sol) and slightly underestimated for high-mass galaxies (M*&gt;~10^9M_sol). We demonstrate that these trends arise due to the SED fitting code poorly modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband photometry. These systematic trends, which exist for all star formation history parametrisations tested, have a tilting effect on the inferred stellar mass function, with number densities of massive galaxies underestimated (particularly at the lowest redshifts studied) and number densities of lower-mass galaxies typically overestimated. Overall, this work suggests that we should be optimistic about our ability to infer the masses of high-z galaxies observed with JWST (notwithstanding contamination from AGN) but careful when modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband photometry.

  Current reverberation mapping (RM) studies primarily focus on single emission lines, particularly the \hb\ line, which may not fully reveal the geometry and kinematic properties of the broad-line region (BLR). To overcome this limitation, we conducted multiline RM observations on two highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs), KUG 1141+371 and UGC 3374, using the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope. Our goal was to investigate the detailed structure of different regions within the BLR. We measured the time lags of multiple broad emission lines (\ha, \hb, \hg, \hei, and \heii) and found clear evidence of radial ionization stratification in the BLRs of both AGNs. Velocity-resolved RM analysis revealed distinct geometry and kinematics between the inner and outer regions of the BLRs. Assuming that velocity-resolved lags reflect the kinematics of BLR, our observations indicate that: (1) in KUG 1141+371, the inner BLR exhibits outflow signatures, while the outer region is consistent with virialized motion; (2) in UGC 3374, the inner region displays virial motion, while the outer region shows inflow. Furthermore, we detected ``breathing" behavior in the outer BLR regions of both AGN, while the inner BLR regions show ``anti-breathing", which may be linked to intrinsic BLR properties. We discuss these findings in the context of various BLR formation models, highlighting importance of long-term, multiline RM campaigns in understanding of BLR structure and evolution. Additionally, our results suggest that the observed stratification in BLR geometry and kinematics may contribute to the scatter in black hole mass estimates and the rapid changes in velocity-resolved RM signatures reported in recent studies.

  Binary black hole (BBH) evolution in the discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising channel for gravitational wave (GW)-driven mergers. It is however unclear whether binaries interacting with the surrounding disc undergo orbital contraction or expansion. We develop a simple analytic model of accreting BBHs in AGN discs to follow the orbital evolution from the disc-dominated regime at large separations into the GW-driven regime at small separations (the coupled `disc+GW'-driven evolution). We obtain that accreting binaries expand in thick discs with aspect ratio greater than a critical value ($&gt; h_\mathrm{crit}$); whereas accreting binaries contract and eventually merge in thin discs ($&lt; h_\mathrm{crit}$). Interestingly, accreting BBHs can experience faster mergers compared to non-accreting counterparts, with a non-monotonic dependence on the disc aspect ratio. The orbital contraction is usually coupled with eccentricity growth in the disc-dominated regime, which lead to accelerated inspirals in the GW-driven regime. We quantify the resulting BBH merger timescales in AGN discs ($\tau_\mathrm{merger} \sim 10^5 - 10^7$ yr) and estimate the associated GW merger rates ($\mathcal{R} \sim (0.2 - 5) \, \text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{yr}^{-1}$). Overall, accreting binaries may efficiently contract and merge in thin discs, hence this particular BBH-in-AGN channel may provide a non-negligible contribution to the observed GW merger event rate.

  JWST has revealed a population of compact `Little Red Dots' (LRDs) at $z\gtrsim4$, with red rest-frame optical and blue UV colors. These objects are likely compact dusty starbursts or heavily reddened AGNs, playing a pivotal role in early black hole growth, dust production, and stellar assembly. We introduce a new photometric selection to identify LRDs over a broad range in redshifts and rest-frame UV-to-NIR colors enabling a more complete census of the population. This method identifies 248 LRDs with F444W$&lt;27$ mag over 263 arcmin$^2$ in the JADES, PRIMER-COSMOS, and UDS fields with MIRI coverage, increasing the number density by $\times$1.7 compared to previous samples, suggesting that previous census were underestimated. Most LRDs are detected in MIRI/F770W but only 7% (17) are detected in F1800W. We use MIRI-based rest-frame [1$-$3 $\mu$m] colors to trace dust emission. F1800W-detected LRDs have a median [1$-$3 $\mu$m]$=1.5$ mag, with a broad scatter indicative of diverse dust emission properties. About 20% exhibit [1$-$3 $\mu$m]$&lt;1$ mag colors consistent with negligible dust emission, but the majority show significant dust emission at 3 $\mu$m (f$^{\rm dust}_{3\mu m}\lesssim0.8$) from the galaxy ISM or a hot-dust-deficient AGN torus. A correlation between bluer UV-to-NIR colors and stronger IR emission suggests that the bluest LRDs may resemble unobscured QSOs. We report a LRD at $z_{\rm spec}=3.1386$, detected in MIRI, Spitzer/MIPS, and Herschel/PACS. Its IR SED rises steeply at $\lambda_{\rm rest}&gt;6~\mu$m and peaks near $\sim40~\mu$m, providing the first direct evidence of warm dust emission (T$=50-100$ K) in a LRD.

  We studied bent radio sources within X-ray galaxy groups in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields, using radio data from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Explorations data release 1 (MIGHTEE-DR1) at 1.2-1.3 GHz (angular resolutions of 8.9" and 5"; &lt;rms&gt; ~ 3.5 and 5.5 uJy/beam). Bent radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) were identified via visual inspection. Our analysis included 19 bent radio AGN in the COSMOS field and 17 in the XMM-LSS field which lie within X-ray galaxy groups (2x10^13 &gt;= M200c/Msun = 3x10^14). We investigated the relationship between their bending angle (BA) - the angle formed by the jets or lobes of two-sided radio sources associated with AGN - and properties of their host galaxies and large-scale environment probed by the X-ray galaxy groups. Our key findings are: a) In the XMM-LSS field, we observed a strong correlation between the linear projected size of the bent AGN, the group halo mass, and the projected distance from the group centre. This trend, consistent with previous studies, was not detected in the COSMOS sample. b) The BA is a function of environmental density, with the type of medium playing a significant role. Additionally, at z &lt;= 0.5 we found a higher number of bent sources (BA &lt;= 160deg) compared to higher redshifts (z ~ 1), by a factor of &gt;1.5. This trend aligns with magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which suggest that denser environments and longer interaction times at lower redshifts contribute to this effect. Comparison with the literature suggests that jet bending in galaxy groups within the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 is primarily driven by ram pressure exerted on the jets, which occurs during quiescent phases of AGN activity. This study underscores the role of environmental interactions in shaping the morphology of radio AGN within galaxy groups, providing insights into the interplay between large-scale structure and AGN physics.

  The number of strong lensing systems will soon increase by orders of magnitude thanks to sensitive, wide-field optical and infrared imaging surveys such as Euclid, Rubin-LSST, and Roman. A dramatic increase in strong lenses will also occur at radio wavelengths. The 2000-antenna Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-2000) will detect over $10^9$ continuum sources in the Northern Hemisphere with a high mean redshift ($\langle z_s \rangle \approx2$) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will observe a large sample of extragalactic sources in the South with sub-arcsecond resolution. We forecast lensing rates, finding that the DSA-2000 will discover $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ strongly lensed systems, many of which will be galaxy group and cluster lenses. We propose strategies for strong lensing discovery in the limit where the Einstein radii are comparable to the PSF angular scale, taking advantage of modern computer vision techniques and multi-survey data. We also forecast synergies with optical and infrared surveys, which will provide redshifts as well as multiwavelength information about the lens systems. Finally, we describe applications of radio strong lensing systems, including time-delay cosmography with transient and variable sources. We find that $\sim$100 time-variable flat-spectrum AGN discovered by the DSA-2000 could be used to constrain $H_0$ at the percent level with the appropriate follow-up.

  We studied the multiwavelength properties of NGC 3521, the Milky Way galaxy-twin, from UV- to radio, exploring the data from GALEX for UV-, SDSS for optical, 2MASS, WISE, MIPS (Spitzer) and PACS, SPIRE (Herschel) for IR-, and NRAO VLA for radio ranges. To obtain the spectral energy distribution (SED), we exploited the CIGALE software and constructed SEDs without (model A) and with (model B) AGN module. The type of nuclear activity of NGC 3521 is confirmed as the LINER. We also present the results of the photometric data processing. Exploring the ZTF observations in 2018-2024, we found, for the first time, a weak photometric variability of the nuclear activity, where the correlation between g-r color indices and g-magnitude for long-term timescale shows a BWB trend (bluer-when-brighter) with a Pearson coefficient r(g-r)=0.56, which is a medium correlation. To detect the variability of NGC 3521 during the day (IDV), we provided observations using a Zeiss-600 telescope with an aperture size of 8" at the Terskol observatory. The data obtained in the R-filter with an exposure of 90 sec for three hours on Feb 11, 2022, serve in favor of a trend towards an increase in brightness with the amplitude of variability of 0.04 +- 0.001 mag. According to the results of the simulations, the best fit to the observed SED is provided by model A, which considers the contribution to the radiation from all galaxy components, assuming that the galaxy nucleus is inactive. Within this model, we derived the stellar mass M$_{star}$ = 2.13 * 10$^{10} M_{Sun}$, the dust mass M$_{dust}$ = 8.45 * 10$^{7} M_{Sun}$, and the star formation rate SFR = 1.76 $M_{Sun}$ * yr$^{-1}$ with $\chi^{2}$/d.o.f = 1.8. Also, based on the HIPASS radio data, we estimated the mass of neutral hydrogen to be M$_{HI}$ = 1.3 * 10$^{10} M_{Sun}$, which is an order of magnitude greater than the mass of the stellar component.

  We present an analysis of the metal-poor galaxy spectra in the redshift range 0.00574$\leq$z$\leq$0.05368 which were reported by Nakajima et al (2022) in their EMPG (extreme metal poor galaxy) sample. The models account for the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the starburst (SB) galaxies, for accretion and ejection, for the physical parameters and the element abundances. The results are obtained in particular for the two cases, the emitting nebula is ejected outward from the galaxy radiation source (RS) and the emitting nebula is accreted towards the RS. We adopt the code {\sc suma} which allows to choose the direction of the clouds relative to the RS. The modelling results which reproduce a single galaxy spectrum with the highest precision allow to classify this object as an AGN ejecting, an AGN accreting, an SB ejecting or an SB accreting type. When more models are equally valid we suggest that the galaxy is the product of merging. Our results show that among the eleven sample galaxies five are such. We focus on the N/O trends with the oxygen metallicity and with the redshift to identify the nitrogen/oxygen relative formation processes and the process-rates, respectively, for intermediate-mass stars. Our results show that O/H relative abundances calculated for the sample galaxies are lower than solar by a factor $\leq$5. Yet, a few values were found above solar. He/H were calculated lower than solar by factors $\leq$ 100 and N/H by factors $\leq$135.

  We present a sample of 398 galaxies with ionized gas outflow signatures in their spectra from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey Data Release 4, including 45 low-mass galaxies with stellar masses $M_*&lt;10^{10}$ $M_\odot$. We assemble our sample by systematically searching for the presence of a second velocity component in the [O III]$\lambda\lambda 4959, 5007$ doublet emission line in 39,612 galaxies with redshifts $z&lt;0.3$. The host galaxies are classified using the BPT diagram, with $\sim$89% identified as AGNs and composites and 11% as star-forming (SF) galaxies. The outflows are typically faster in AGNs with a median velocity of 936 km s$^{-1}$ compared to 655 km s$^{-1}$ in the SF objects. Of particular interest are the 45 galaxies in the low-mass range, of which a third are classified as AGNs/composites. The outflows from the low-mass AGNs are also faster and more blueshifted compared to those in the low-mass SF galaxies. This indicates that black hole outflows can affect host galaxies in the low-mass range and that AGN feedback in galaxies with $M_*&lt;10^{10}$ $ M_\odot$ should be considered in galaxy evolution models.
