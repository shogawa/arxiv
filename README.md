  Identification of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light ($f_{AGN}$). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of $f_{AGN}$. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction $f_{AGN}$, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected $f_{AGN}$ is $-0.0006$ and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is $0.027$. The relative absolute error (RAE) is $0.086$ and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE $&gt;20\%$) fraction is $7.8\%$. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -$0.024$, RMSE of $0.09$, RAE of $0.19$ and outlier fraction of $19\%$. Our DL-based method to identify AGNs and estimate $f_{AGN}$ is extremely fast and easy to use and has a huge potential in future applications to large galaxy imaging surveys.

  Blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes, are known for their remarkable variability across multiple timescales and wavelengths. With advancements in both ground- and space-based telescopes, our understanding of AGN central engines has significantly improved. However, the mechanisms driving this variability remain elusive, and continue to fascinate both theorists and observers alike. The primary objective of this study is to constrain the X-ray variability properties of the TeV blazar PKS 2155-304. We conduct a comprehensive X-ray spectral and timing analysis, focusing on both long-term and intra-day variability. This analysis uses data from 22 epochs of XMM-Newton EPIC-pn observations, collected over 15 years (2000-2014). To investigate the variability of the source, we applied both timing and spectral analyses. For the timing analysis, we estimated fractional variability, variability amplitude, minimum variability timescales, flux distribution, and power spectral density (PSD). In the spectral analysis, we fitted the X-ray spectra using power-law, log-parabola, and broken power-law (BPL) models to determine the best-fitting parameters. Additionally, we studied the hardness ratio (HR). We observed moderate intra-day variability in most of the light curves. Seven out of the twenty-two observations showed a clear bimodal flux distribution, indicating the presence of two distinct flux states. Our analysis revealed a variable power-law PSD slope. Most HR plots did not show significant variation with flux, except for one observation (OBSID 0124930501), where HR increased with flux (Count/s). The fitted X-ray spectra favored the BPL model for the majority of observations. The findings of this work shed light on the intraday variability of blazars, providing insights into the non-thermal jet processes that drive the observed flux variations.

  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and its impact on their host galaxies are critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. Here, we present a combined analysis of new high resolution ultraviolet (UV) data from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on AstroSat and archival optical spectroscopic data from VLT/MUSE, for the Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365. Concentrating on the central 5 kpc region, the UVIT images in the far and near UV show bright star forming knots in the circumnuclear ring as well as a faint central source. After correcting for extinction, we found the star formation rate (SFR) surface density of the circumnuclear 2 kpc ring to be similar to other starbursts, despite the presence of an AGN outflow, as seen in [OIII] 5007 Angstrom. On the other hand, we found fainter UV and thus lower SFR in the direction south-east of the AGN relative to north-west in agreement with observations at other wavelengths from JWST and ALMA. The AGN outflow velocity is found to be lesser than the escape velocity, suggesting that the outflowing gas will rain back into the galaxy. The deep UV data has also revealed diffuse UV emission in the direction of the AGN outflow. By combining [OIII] and UV data, we found the diffuse emission to be of AGN origin.

  In this paper, we present a simple but compelling argument, focusing on galaxy science, for preserving the main imagers and operational modes of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for as long as is technically feasible. While star-formation started at redshifts z$\gtrsim$10$-$13, when the universe was less than 300$-$500 Myr old, the CSFH did not peak until z$\simeq$1.9, and has steadily declined since that time. Hence, at least half of all stars in the universe formed in the era where HST provides its unique rest-frame UV view of unobscured young, massive stars tracing cosmic star-formation. By rendering a subset of the 556.3 hours of available HST images in 12 filters of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) in an appropriate mix of colors, we illustrate the unique capabilities of HST for galaxy science emphasizing that rest-frame UV$-$optical wavelength range. We then contrast this with the 52.7 publicly available hours of JWST/NIRCam images in 8 filters of the same HUDF area from the JADES project, rendering these at the redder near-IR wavelengths to illustrate the unique capabilities of JWST to detect older stellar populations at higher redshifts, as well as very dusty stellar populations and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). HST uniquely probes (unobscured) young, hot, massive stars in galaxies, while JWST reveals more advanced stages of older stellar populations, as well as relatively short-lived phases where galaxies produce and shed a lot of dust from intense star-formation, and the very high redshift universe (z$\gtrsim$10$-$11) not accessible by HST. We conclude that HST and JWST are highly complementary facilities that took decades to build to ensure decades of operation. To maximize return on investment on both HST and JWST, ways will need to be found to operate HST imaging instruments in all relevant modes for as long as possible into the JWST mission.

  Multiple galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at kpc separation from each other are exceedingly rare, and in fact, only one quadruple AGN is known so far. These extreme density peaks are expected to pinpoint protocluster environments and therefore be surrounded by large galaxy overdensities. In this letter, we present another quadruple AGN candidate at $z \sim 3$ including two SDSS quasars at a separation of roughly 480 kpc. The brighter quasar is accompanied by two AGN candidates (a type 1 AGN and a likely type 2 quasar) at close ($\sim 20$ kpc) separation identified through emission line ratios, line widths and high ionization lines like NV$\lambda1240$. The extended Ly$\alpha$ emission associated with the close triple system is more modest in extent and brightness compared to similar multiple AGN systems and could be caused by ram-pressure stripping of the type-2 quasar host during infall into the central dark matter halo. The projected evolution of the system into a $z=0$ galaxy cluster with the AGN host galaxies forming the brightest cluster galaxy needs to be further tested by galaxy overdensity studies on large scales around the quadruple AGN candidate. If confirmed as a quadruple AGN with X-ray observations or rest-frame optical line ratios, this system would represent the second AGN quartet, the highest-redshift multiplet and the closest high-redshift triplet known.

  JWST has now revealed a population of broad-line AGN at $z&gt;4$ characterized by a distinctive SED shape, with very red rest-frame optical and very blue rest-frame UV continuum. While the optical continuum is thought to originate from the accretion disk, the origin of the UV continuum has been largely unclear. We report the detection of the strong rest-frame UV emission lines of CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,1909 and CIV$\lambda\lambda$1549,1551 in a "little red dot" AGN, COS-66964. Spectroscopically confirmed at $z=7.0371$, COS-66964 exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$), and weak broad H$\beta$, implying significant dust attenuation to the BLR ($A_V = 3.9^{+1.7}_{-0.9}$). The H$\alpha$ line width implies a central SMBH mass of $M_{\rm BH} = \left(1.9^{+1.6}_{-0.7}\right)\times10^{7}$ M$_\odot$, and an Eddington ratio $\lambda\sim0.3$-$0.5$. While marginal HeII$\lambda4687$ and [FeX]$\lambda6376$ detections further indicate that the AGN dominates in the rest-frame optical, the non-detection of HeII$\lambda1640$ in the UV despite high EW CIII] and CIV ($\sim 35$ {\AA}) is more consistent with photoionization by massive stars. The non-detection of MgII$\lambda\lambda$2800 is similarly inconsistent with an AGN scattered light interpretation. Assuming the rest-frame UV is dominated by stellar light, we derive a stellar mass of $\log M_\star/M_\odot\sim8.5$, implying an elevated $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratio $\sim2$ orders of magnitude above the local relation, but consistent with other high-$z$ AGN discovered by JWST. The source is unresolved in all bands, implying a very compact size $\lesssim200$ pc in the UV. This suggests that the simultaneous buildup of compact stellar populations (i.e., galaxy bulges) and the central SMBH is ongoing even at $z&gt;7$.   

X-Ray Weak AGNs from Super-Eddington Accretion onto Infant Black Holes

  A simple model for the X-ray weakness of JWST-selected broad-line AGNs is proposed under the assumption that the majority of these sources are fed at super-Eddington accretion rates. In these conditions, the hot inner corona above the geometrically thin disk that is responsible for the emission of X-rays in "normal" AGNs will be embedded instead in a funnel-like reflection geometry. The coronal plasma will Compton upscatter optical/UV photons from the underlying thick disk as well as the surrounding funnel walls, and the high soft-photon energy density will cool down the plasma to temperatures in the range 30-40 keV. The resulting X-ray spectra are predicted to be extremely soft, with power-law photon indices Gamma=2.8-4.0, making high-z super-Eddington AGNs largely undetectable by Chandra.

  The current paradigm for the co-evolution of galaxies and their supermassive black holes postulates that dust-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a transitional phase towards a more luminous and unobscured state. However, our understanding of dusty AGNs and their host galaxies at early cosmic times is inadequate due to observational limitations. Here, we present JWST observations of CID-931, an X-ray-detected AGN at a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=4.91$. Multiband NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web program reveals an unresolved red core, similar to JWST-discovered dusty AGNs. Strikingly, the red core is surrounded by at least eight massive star-forming clumps spread over $1.\!\!^{\prime\prime}6 \approx 10~{\rm kpc}$, each of which has a stellar mass of $10^9-10^{10}M_\odot$ and $\sim0.1-1~{\rm kpc}$ in radius. The whole system amounts to $10^{11}M_\odot$ in stellar mass, higher than typical star-forming galaxies at the same epoch. In this system, gas inflows and/or complex merger events may trigger clump formation and AGN activity thus leading to the rapid formation of a massive galaxy hosting a supermassive black hole. Future follow-up observations will provide new insights into the evolution of the galaxy-black hole relationship during such transitional phases in the early universe.

  Recently, a large number of compact sources at $z &gt; 4$ with blue UV slopes and extremely red rest-frame optical slopes have been found in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extragalactic surveys. As a subsample of these sources, commonly called ``little red dots'' (LRDs), have been spectroscopically observed to host a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), they have been the focus of multiple recent studies in an attempt to understand the origin of their UV and optical emission. Here, we assemble a sample of 123 LRDs from the literature along with spectroscopic and photometric JWST-identified samples of AGNs to compare their colors and spectral slopes. We find that while obscured AGNs at $z &lt; 6$ have highly dissimilar colors to LRDs, unobscured AGNs at $z &lt; 6$ span a wide range of colors, with only a subsample showing colors similar to LRDs. At $z &gt; 6$, the majority of the unobscured AGNs that have been found in these samples are LRDs, but this may be related to the fact that these sources are at large bolometric luminosities. Because LRDs occupy a unique position in galaxy color space, they are more straightforward to target, and the large number of broad-line AGNs that do not have LRD colors and slopes are therefore underrepresented in many spectroscopic surveys because they are more difficult to pre-select. Current LRD selection techniques return a large and disparate population, including many sources having $2-5\mu$m colors impacted by emission line flux boosting in individual filters.
