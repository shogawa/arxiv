  We present a comprehensive study of Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), leveraging data from the IRAS Faint Source Catalogue (FSC) and the spectroscopic catalog in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR16. Our meticulous cross-matching technique significantly enhances the reliability of ULIRG identification, resulting in the identification of 283 reliable ULIRGs, including 102 new detections, while discarding 120 previously reported false sources. Covering a redshift range of $z = 0.018 - 0.996$, with a median redshift of $\bar{z} = 0.259$, our uniform sample reveals apparent interaction features in approximately 40\% of ULIRGs, increasing to 92\% for those with $z &lt; 0.1$. Through optical spectra analysis, it is indicated that over 58\% of ULIRGs host an AGN, which is twice as high as the detections based solely on infrared colors. Moreover, a pronounced excess of radio emissions associated with AGN activity results in a steeper radio-far-infrared correlation. Notably, Type I ULIRGs exhibit properties similar to those of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), with an elevated incidence rate of \ion{Mg}{2} BALs (16.7\%), surpassing that of typical optically selected quasars by over tenfold, consistent with current evolutionary models. We anticipate that forthcoming telescopes such as the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT) will provide deeper insights into ULIRG morphology, dust distribution, molecular gas, and AGN activity.

  We use mid-infrared variability in galaxies to search for active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local universe. We use a sample of 10,220 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV). For each galaxy, we examine its mid-infrared variability in the $W2$ $[4.6\mu m]$ band over thirteen years using data from the Wide Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All-Sky and Near Earth Objects WISE (NEOWISE) missions. We demonstrate that we can detect variability signatures as small as about $7\%$ in the root-mean-square variation of $W2$ flux for the majority of cases. Using other AGN signatures of the variable galaxies, such as optical narrow lines, optical broad lines, and WISE $W1-W2$ colors, we show that $\sim 75\%$ of the variables show these additional AGN signatures, indicating that the bulk of these cases are likely to be AGN. We also identify seven galaxies that have light-curves characteristic of tidal disruption events. We present here a publicly available catalog of the light-curve variability in $W2$ of these galaxies.

  Broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) originate from the broad-line region (BLR), consisting of dense gas clouds in orbit around an accreting supermassive black hole. Understanding the geometry and kinematics of the region is crucial for gaining insights into the physics and evolution of AGNs. Conventional velocity-resolved reverberation mapping may face challenges in disentangling the degeneracy between intricate motion and geometry of this region. To address this challenge, new key constraints are required. Here, we report the discovery of an asymmetric BLR using a novel technique: velocity-resolved ionization mapping, which can map the distance of emitting gas clouds by measuring Hydrogen line ratios at different velocities. By analyzing spectroscopic monitoring data, we find that the Balmer decrement is anticorrelated with the continuum and correlated with the lags across broad emission line velocities. Some line ratio profiles deviate from the expectations for a symmetrically virialized BLR, suggesting that the red-shifted and blue-shifted gas clouds may not be equidistant from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This asymmetric geometry might represent a formation imprint, provide new perspectives on the evolution of AGNs, and influence SMBH mass measurements.

  JWST has revealed a ubiquitous population of "little red dots" (LRDs) at $z\gtrsim4$, selected via their red rest-frame optical emission and compact morphologies. They are thought to be reddened by dust, whether in tori of active galactic nuclei or the interstellar medium (ISM), though none have direct dust detections to date. Informed by the average characteristics of 675 LRDs drawn from the literature, we provide ballpark constraints on the dust characteristics of the LRD population and estimate they have average dust masses of $\langle M_{dust}\rangle=(1.6^{+4.8}_{-0.9})\times10^{4}$ M$_\odot$, luminosities of $\langle L_{IR}\rangle = (8^{+3}_{-5})\times10^{10}$ L$_\odot$ and temperatures of $\langle T_{dust}\rangle = 110^{+21}_{-36}$ K. Notably, the spectral energy distributions are thought to peak at $\sim$100 K (rest-frame 20-30$\mu m$) regardless of heating mechanism, whether AGN or star formation. Our predictions likely mean LRDs have, on average, submillimeter emission a factor of $\sim$100$\times$ fainter than current ALMA limits provide. If one assumes LRDs' rest-optical light is dominated by stars, the star-to-dust ratio is a factor of $\sim$100$\times$ larger than expected from dust formation models; this suggests LRDs' stellar masses may be significantly overestimated. Despite their high apparent volume density, LRDs contribute negligibly (0.1%) to the cosmic dust budget at $z\gtrsim4$ due to their low dust masses.

  JWST has uncovered a substantial population of high-$z$ ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies exhibiting broad H$\alpha$ emission line with a Full Width at Half Maximum exceeding $1,000$~km~s$^{-1}$. This population includes a subset known as 'Little Red Dots', characterized by their compact morphology and extremely red rest-frame optical colors. If all of these broad H$\alpha$ emitters were attributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of five JWST broad H$\alpha$ emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\sim 400-500$~days$/(1+z)$) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\lambda_{\text{rest}} \sim 1,500-9,000$\AA\ has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep {\it Chandra} data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.
