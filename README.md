  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all wavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last decade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and densely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert galaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical continuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the X-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC 4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from archival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X-ray reverberation model by determining the disc's transfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion rates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be fully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.

  We analyze JWST MIRI/MRS IFU observations of three Seyferts and showcase the intriguing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission characteristics in regions of $\sim 500\,\rm pc$ scales over or around their active galactic nuclei (AGN). Combining the model predictions and the measurements of PAH features and other infrared emission lines, we find that the central regions containing a high fraction of neutral PAHs with small sizes, e.g., those in ESO137-G034, are in highly heated environments, due to collisional shock heating, with hard and moderately intense radiation fields. Such environments are proposed to be associated with inhibited growth or preferential erosion of PAHs, decreasing the average PAH size and the overall abundance of PAHs. We additionally find that the central regions containing a high fraction of ionized PAHs with large sizes, e.g., those in MCG-05-23-016, are likely experiencing severe photo-ionization because of the radiative effects from the radiative shock precursor besides the AGN. The severe photo-ionization can contribute to the ionization of all PAHs and further destruction of small PAHs. Overall, different Seyferts, even different regions in the same galaxy, e.g., those in NGC\,3081, can contain PAH populations of different properties. Specifically, Seyferts that exhibit similar PAH characteristics to ESO137-G034 and MCG-05-23-016 also tend to have similar emission line properties to them, suggesting that the explanations for PAH characteristics of ESO137-G034 and MCG-05-23-016 may also apply generally. These results have promising application in the era of JWST, especially in diagnosing different (i.e., radiative, and kinetic) AGN feedback modes.

  Utilizing JWST MIRI/MRS IFU observations of the kiloparsec scale central regions, we showcase the diversity of ionized gas distributions and kinematics in six nearby Seyfert galaxies included in the GATOS survey. Specifically, we present spatially resolved flux distribution and velocity field maps of six ionized emission lines covering a large range of ionization potentials ($15.8-97.1$ eV). Based on these maps, we showcase the evidence of ionized gas outflows in the six targets, and find some highly disturbed regions in NGC\,5728, NGC\,5506, and ESO137-G034. We propose AGN-driven radio jets plausibly play an important role in triggering these highly disturbed regions. With the outflow rates estimated based on [Ne~{\footnotesize V}] emission, we find the six targets tend to have ionized outflow rates converged to a narrower range than previous finding. These results have important implication for the outflow properties in AGN of comparable luminosity.

  The characteristic timescale at which the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) turns from red noise to white noise can probe the accretion physics around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A number of works have studied the characteristic timescale of quasars and obtained quite different scaling relations between the timescale and quasar physical properties. One possible reason for the discrepancies is that the characteristic timescale can be easily underestimated if the light curves are not long enough. In this work, we construct well-defined AGN samples to observationally test the relationships between the characteristic timescale and AGN properties obtained by previous works. Our samples eliminate the effects of insufficient light-curve lengths. We confirm that the timescale predictions \citep{Zhou2024} of the Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing model are consistent with our timescale measurements. The timescale predictions by empirically relations \citep[e.g.,][]{Kelly2009} are systematically smaller than our measured ones. Our results provide further evidence that AGN variability is driven by thermal fluctuations in SMBH accretion disks. Future flagship time-domain surveys can critically test our conclusions and reveal the physical nature of AGN variability.

  In this study, we examine the role of circumgalactic medium (CGM) angular momentum ($j_{\rm CGM}$) on star formation in galaxies, whose influence is currently not well understood. The analysis utilises central galaxies from two hydrodynamical simulations, SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. We observe a substantial divergence in how star formation rates correlate with CGM angular momentum between the two simulations. Specifically, quenched galaxies in IllustrisTNG show high $j_{\rm CGM}$, while in SIMBA, quenched galaxies have low $j_{\rm CGM}$. This difference is attributed to the distinct active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback mechanisms active in each simulation. Moreover, both simulations demonstrate similar correlations between $j_{\rm CGM}$ and environmental angular momentum ($j_{\rm Env}$) in star-forming galaxies, but these correlations change notably when kinetic AGN feedback is present. In IllustrisTNG, quenched galaxies consistently show higher $j_{\rm CGM}$ compared to their star-forming counterparts with the same $j_{\rm Env}$, a trend not seen in SIMBA. Examining different AGN feedback models in SIMBA, we further confirm that AGN feedback significantly influences the CGM gas distribution, although the relationship between the cold gas fraction and the star formation rate (SFR) remains largely stable across different feedback scenarios.

  Time-domain studies of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) offer a powerful tool for understanding black hole accretion physics. Prior to the optical outburst on 23 December 2017, 1ES 1927+654 was classified as a "true" type~2 AGN, an unobscured source intrinsically devoid of broad-line emission in polarized spectra. Through our three-year monitoring campaign spanning X-ray to ultraviolet/optical wavelengths, we analyze the post-outburst evolution of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 1ES 1927+654. Examination of the intrinsic SED and subsequent modeling using different models reveal that the post-outburst spectrum is best described by a combination of a disk, blackbody, and corona components. We detect systematic SED variability and identify four distinct stages in the evolution of these components. During the event the accretion rate is typically above the Eddington limit. The correlation between ultraviolet luminosity and optical to X-ray slope ($\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$) resembles that seen in previous studies of type 1 AGNs, yet exhibits two distinct branches with opposite slopes. The optical bolometric correction factor ($\kappa_{5100}$) is $\sim 10$ times higher than typical AGNs, again displaying two distinct branches. Correlations among the corona optical depth, disk surface density, and $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$ provide compelling evidence of a disk-corona connection. The X-ray corona showcases systematic variation in the compactness-temperature plot. Between 200 and 650 days, the corona is "hotter-when-brighter", whereas after 650 days, it becomes "cooler-when-brighter". This bimodal behavior, in conjunction with the bifurcated branches of $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$ and $\kappa_{5100}$, offers strong evidence of a transition from a slim disk to thin disk $\sim 650$ days after the outburst.

  X-ray reverberation mapping is a powerful technique for probing the innermost accretion disk, whereas continuum reverberation mapping in the UV, optical, and infrared (UVOIR) reveals reprocessing by the rest of the accretion disk and broad-line region (BLR). We present the time lags of Mrk 817 as a function of temporal frequency measured from 14 months of high-cadence monitoring from Swift and ground-based telescopes, in addition to an XMM-Newton observation, as part of the AGN STORM 2 campaign. The XMM-Newton lags reveal the first detection of a soft lag in this source, consistent with reverberation from the innermost accretion flow. These results mark the first simultaneous measurement of X-ray reverberation and UVOIR disk reprocessing lags$\unicode{x2013}$effectively allowing us to map the entire accretion disk surrounding the black hole. Similar to previous continuum reverberation mapping campaigns, the UVOIR time lags arising at low temporal frequencies are longer than those expected from standard disk reprocessing by a factor of 2-3. The lags agree with the anticipated disk reverberation lags when isolating short-timescale variability, namely timescales shorter than the H$\beta$ lag. Modeling the lags requires additional reprocessing constrained at a radius consistent with the BLR size scale inferred from contemporaneous H$\beta$-lag measurements. When we divide the campaign light curves, the UVOIR lags show substantial variations, with longer lags measured when obscuration from an ionized outflow is greatest. We suggest that, when the obscurer is strongest, reprocessing by the BLR elongates the lags most significantly. As the wind weakens, the lags are dominated by shorter accretion disk lags.

  We present the CO(1-0) maps of 28 infrared-bright galaxies from the Great Observatories All-Sky Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (GOALS) taken with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). We detect 100GHz continuum in 16 of 28 galaxies, which trace both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and compact star-forming cores. The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\alpha_{\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to "enhanced" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components.
