  We present the multi-wavelength and environmental properties of 37 variability-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including 30 low luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), using a high cadence time-domain survey (ASAS-SN) from a spectroscopic sample of 1218 nearby bright galaxies. We find that high-cadence time-domain surveys uniquely select LLAGNs that do not necessarily satisfy other AGN selection methods, such as X-ray, mid-IR, or BPT methods. In our sample, 3% of them pass the mid-infrared color based AGN selection, 18% pass the X-ray luminosity based AGN selection, and 60% pass the BPT selection. This result is supported by two other LLAGN samples from high-cadence time-domain surveys of TESS and PTF, suggesting that the variability selection method from well-sampled light curves can find AGNs that may not be discovered otherwise. These AGNs can have moderate to small amplitudes of variability from the accretion disk, but, of many of them, with no strong corona, emission lines from the central engine, or accretion power to dominate the mid-IR emission. The X-ray spectra of a sub-sample of bright sources are consistent with a power law model. Upon inspecting the environments of our sample, we find that LLAGNs are more common in denser environments of galaxy clusters in contrast with the trend established in the literature for luminous AGNs at low redshifts, which is broadly consistent with our analysis result for luminous AGNs limited by a smaller sample size. This contrast in environmental properties between LLAGN and luminous AGNs suggests that LLAGNs may have different trigger mechanisms.

  Peaked-spectrum (PS) sources, known for their distinct peaked radio spectra, represent a type of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). Among these, megahertz-peaked spectrum (MPS) sources, which exhibit a spectral peak at a frequency of a hundred megahertz, have emerged as a potential tool for identifying high-redshift candidates. However, the potential evolutionary link between the fraction of these sources and redshift remains unclear and requires further investigation. The recent, high sensitivity Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) surveys enable statistical studies of these objects to ultra-low frequencies (&lt; 150 MHz). In this study, we first use the multiradio data to investigate the evolution of spectral index with redshift for 1,187 quasars from the SDSS 16th quasar catalog. For each quasar, we analyze available data from the LOFAR Low Band Antenna (LBA) at 54 MHz, High Band Antenna (HBA) at 144 MHz, and the Very Large Array (VLA) the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) at 1.4 GHz. We measure the spectral index ($\alpha^{144}_{54}$ and $\alpha^{1400}_{144}$) and find no significant change in their median values with the redshift. Extended sources have steeper spectral indices than compact sources, which is consistent with previous findings. Based on the spectral indices information, we identify MPS sources using these criteria: $\rm \alpha^{144}_{54} &gt;= 0.1$ and $\rm \alpha^{1400}_{144} &lt; 0$, and analyze their properties. We find that the fraction of MPS sources is constant with the redshift ($0.1-4.8$), bolometric luminosity ($\rm 10^{44}-10^{48} erg/s$), and supermassive black hole mass ($\rm 10^{7}-10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$), which suggests that MPS sources have relatively stable physical conditions or formation mechanisms across various evolutionary stages and environments.

  Understanding the origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) stands as one of the most important challenges in astrophysics and cosmology, with little current theoretical consensus. Improved observational constraints on the cosmological evolution of SMBH demographics are needed. Here we report results of a search via photometric variability for SMBHs appearing as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the cosmological volume defined by the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). This work includes particular focus on a new observation carried out in 2023 with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} using the WFC3/IR/F140W, which is compared directly to equivalent data taken 11 years earlier in 2012. Two earlier pairs of observations from 2009 to 2012 with WFC3/IR/F105W and WFC3/IR/F160W are also analysed. We identify 443, 149, and 78 AGN candidates as nuclear sources that exhibit photometric variability at a level of 2, 2.5 and 3~$\sigma$ in at least one filter. This sample includes 29, 14, and 9 AGN at redshifts $z&gt;6$, when the Universe was $\lesssim900$~Myr old. After variability and luminosity function (down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17\:$mag) completeness corrections, we estimate the co-moving number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}(z)$. At $z = 6 - 9$, $n_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim 10^{-2}\:{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$. At low-$z$ our observations are sensitive to AGN fainter than $M_{\rm UV}=-17 \:$mag, and we estimate $n_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim 6\times 10^{-2}\:{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$. We discuss how these results place strong constraints on a variety of SMBH seeding theories.

  We use a sample of Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) spectra in order to investigate which atomic processes are responsible for some observed properties of the FeII emission lines and how they are connected with macroscopic physical characteristics of AGN emission regions. We especially focus on the violated relative intensities between different optical FeII lines, whose relative strengths do not follow the expected values according to atomic parameters. We investigated the connection between this effect and the ratio of optical to UV FeII lines (FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$). We divided the optical FeII lines into two large line groups: consistent (FeII$_{cons}$), whose relative intensities are in accordance with their atomic properties, and inconsistent (FeII$_{incons}$), whose relative intensities are significantly stronger than theoretically expected. We fitted the spectra with a flexible optical FeII model, where Fe II lines were divided into several line groups and fitted independently. We focused particularly on understanding the processes that produce strong inconsistent Fe II lines, and therefore, we investigated their correlations with FeII$_{cons}$ and with UV FeII lines. The ratios of FeII$_{incons}$/FeII$_{cons}$ and FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$ increase as the Eddington ratio increases and as the line widths decrease. It is possible that both ratios are affected by the process of self-absorption of stronger lines, which is responsible for the transmission of energy from the UV to the optical FeII emission lines and, analogously, from the FeII$_{cons}$ to the FeII$_{incons}$ lines. In this scenario, the high Eddington ratio causes an increase in the optical depth in FeII lines, which results in the triggering of the process of self-absorption. The observed FeII spectrum is probably a complex mixture of radiation from emission regions with different physical conditions.

  We examine the origin of molecular gas heating in a sample of 42 infrared-luminous galaxies at $z&lt;0.3$ by combining two sets of archival data. First, integrated CO line luminosities in the 1-0 and 5-4 through 13-12 transitions. Second, results from radiative transfer modelling that decompose their bolometric emission into starburst, AGN, and host galaxy components. We find that the CO 1-0 and 5-4 through 9-8 lines primarily arise via radiative heating in the starburst and the host galaxy. In contrast, the CO 10-9 through 13-12 lines may arise primarily in the starburst and AGN, with an increasing contribution from mechanical heating and shocks. For the sample as a whole, we find no evidence that AGN luminosity affects the heating of molecular gas by star formation. However, for starbursts with low initial optical depths, a more luminous AGN may reduce the efficiency of starburst heating of the CO 5-4 and above lines, consistent with negative AGN feedback.

  We present the third phase of the largest high-frequency, high-resolution imaging survey of 231 nearby, hard X-ray selected AGN, with a very high $98 \pm 1\%$ detection fraction. This survey presents VLA 22 GHz radio observations with 1" spatial resolution covering over $6$ orders of magnitude in radio luminosity in nearby AGN that span $\sim4$ orders of magnitude in black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. We identify three different radio morphologies: $44 \pm 3\%$ (102/231) are compact or unresolved, $46 \pm 3\%$ (106/231) show an extended structure (star formation, possible one-sided jets, etc.), and $8 \pm 2\%$ (19/231) have a biconical or two-sided jet-like morphology. The remaining $2 \pm 1\%$ (4/231) sources are non-detections. The radio-to-X-ray luminosity ratios of the Swift-BAT AGN ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{14-195 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5.5}$ and $\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{2-10 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5}$) with a scatter of $\sim0.5$ dex are similar to that of coronally active stars ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_X \sim 10^{-5}$). For most targets, extended emission in radio-quiet objects is broadly consistent with the expectation for star formation from previous FIR observations, once the contribution from the radio core has been subtracted. Our sample represents nearby analogs of distant AGN at the peak of black hole growth, and thus the high detection fraction in our work has important implications for future high frequency AGN radio surveys with the next generation VLA (ngVLA) or Square Kilometre Array (SKA), both of which should detect large fractions of more distant AGN.

  The assembly of supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($M_{\bullet}$) and stellar mass ($M_{*}$) in galaxies can be studied via the redshift evolution of the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation, but the ways in which selection bias and physical assembly channels affect this evolution are uncertain. To address this, we compare the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation for local massive ($M_{*}&gt;10^{10.5}$M$_{\odot}$) quiescent early-type galaxies (ETGs) to that for massive ETGs hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z\sim0.8$. The restrictions on stellar mass and galaxy type limit the assembly channels that may connect the two relations. For the local sample we find $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 8.80 + 1.10(\log{M_{*}-11})$, in line with prior work. For the $z\sim0.8$ sample we find a bias-corrected relation: $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 7.80 + 1.25(\log{M_{*}-11})$. We show, however, that this relation depends on the stellar and SMBH mass functions used to compute the selection bias, the virial relation, the virial factor, and the active fraction, which together introduce uncertainty of up to $\sim0.6$\,dex in the $z\sim0.8$ relation. Adopting reasonable choices of these parameters then our $z\sim0.8$ relation lies above that for $z\sim0$ AGN by $\sim0.5$\,dex, but below our $z\sim0$ ETG relation by $0.4-1$\,dex in SMBH mass. We discuss possible sources of this offset, including further bias corrections, `downsizing" in SMBH mass assembly, and preferential SMBH growth. Our results highlight the need to reduce uncertainties from selection and measurement bias in SMBH and stellar masses at all redshifts.
