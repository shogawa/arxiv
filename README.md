  The temperature of the cold dust in z&gt;6 galaxies is a potential tracer of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) and stellar feedback, and is the dominant source of uncertainty in inferring properties from the far-infrared (FIR) emission of these galaxies. We present the first resolved dust temperature map in a $z&gt;6$ quasar host galaxy. We combine new 360 pc resolution ALMA Band 9 continuum observations with literature 190 pc Band 6 observations to derive the dust temperature and opacity at 0.1&lt;r&lt;0.5 kpc scales in a $z=6.9$ luminous quasar host galaxy (J2348-3054). We find that the dust temperature (and opacity) increases at the center (r&lt;216 pc) of the galaxy up to $T_d=73-88$ K, and potentially up to $T_d&lt;149$ K at r&lt;110 pc. The combination of the resolved and integrated FIR Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) further reveal a dust temperature gradient and a significant contribution of the AGN hot dust torus at $\nu_{\rm{obs}}\gtrsim 700$ GHz. By taking into account the torus contribution and resolved optically-thick emission, we derive a total infrared luminosity ($L_{TIR}=8.78\pm0.10)\times 10^{12}L_\odot$) and corresponding star-formation rate (SFR$=1307\pm15\ M_\odot\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$), that are at least a factor $\sim 3.6$ ($\sim0.56$ dex) lower than previous measurements assuming optically-thin emission. We compare the resolved dust temperature, mass and IR luminosity profiles to simulations where they are only reproduced by models in which the AGN radiation heats the dust in the center of the galaxy. Our observations provide evidence that dust in J2348--3054 cannot be assumed to be uniformly cold and optically thin. Whether J2348-3054 is representative of the larger population of high-redshift quasars and galaxies remains to be determined with dedicated high-resolution and high-frequency ALMA observations.

  Radial gradients of the brightness temperatures along the parsec-scale jets of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can be used to infer the energy balance and to estimate the parameter range of physical conditions in these regions. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the brightness temperature gradients and geometry profiles of relativistic jets of 447 AGN based on 15 GHz Very Long Baseline Array observations performed between 1994 and 2019. We used models of the jet structure using two-dimensional Gaussian components and analysed variations in their brightness temperatures and sizes along the jets. The size of the jet components, R, increases with projected distance from the jet base, r, as $R\propto r^{1.02\pm0.03}$, i.e., typically following a conically expanding streamline and therefore indicating that the size of jet components is a good tracer of jet geometry. The brightness temperature gradients along the jets typically follow a power-law $T_\mathrm{b} \propto r^{-2.82\pm0.07}$. Half of the sample sources show non-monotonic R(r) or Tb(r) profiles and their distributions were characterised by a double power-law model. We found at least six scenarios to explain the enhancement of the brightness temperature by a presence of inhomogeneities (shocks, jet recollimation) or curvature effects (helical structures, helical magnetic field, non-radial motion, bent jets). Our results are consistent with the scenario that the jet features can be simplified as optically thin moving blobs. In the sources demonstrating transition from a conical to parabolic jet shape, the gradient of the Tb(R) changes at the position of the break consistent with the model of magneto-hydrodynamic acceleration.

  In this paper we further explore the properties of the HERschel Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (HERUS) sample of 42 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with our recently developed Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code SMART (Spectral energy distributions Markov chain Analysis with Radiative Transfer models). SMART fits SEDs exclusively with multicomponent radiative transfer models. Mid-infrared spectroscopy can be included in the fitting at a spectral resolution matched to that of the radiative transfer models. We fit the SEDs of the HERUS ULIRGs with four different models for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, a starburst and a spheroidal galaxy model, to put constraints on the AGN fraction of the galaxies and their star formation rate (SFR). Two of the AGN torus models we explored are smooth and two are two-phase. We find that, in most cases, a smooth tapered AGN torus provides the best fit to the data. We also find that solutions with other torus models may predict AGN and total luminosities up to an order of magnitude or more lower, but very rarely higher than the best-fitting model. In contrast, we find that, with minor exceptions, the predicted SFR and stellar mass of the ULIRGs are generally robustly estimated irrespective of the assumed torus model. This is despite the fact that one of the AGN torus models we use assumes fluffy grains with high emissivity in the far-infrared and submillimetre, which could potentially reduce the contribution of a starburst at those wavelengths and reduce the SFR.
