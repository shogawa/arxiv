  We present Stokes I continuum analysis for a volume-limited sample ($&lt;40~\rm{Mpc}$) of hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using $4-12$ GHz observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). All of the 25 sources analyzed here have previously been observed with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to probe their subparsec projected physical scales, but detected emission has only been measured for 12 of the sources at $C$ band (4.4 GHz), despite expectations. We determined that coronal emission is unlikely to be a dominant emission mechanism for the sources not detected by the VLBA, and the emission measured with the VLA is likely produced beyond parsec spatial scales. We also explore potential radiation mechanisms for the circumnuclear radio emission that is produced beyond the observable ~parsec physical scales probed with the VLBA but within the $\leq30-110$ parsec spatial scales observed with the VLA. From an energetics perspective, we find that all targets have extranuclear radio emission that is compatible with AGN winds, assuming a maximum of 10% of the bolometric output can supply the mechanical energy observed. We also find that the excess emission is likely too strong for star formation alone when compared to results from optical spectroscopy, but may contribute in smaller capacities.

  Over the past decade, a significant amount of effort has been put into investigating the ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Comprehensive studies of intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and surveys of local and high-redshift AGNs have shown that X-ray illumination of AGN accretion discs is a potential explanation for the observed variability. Our main objective is to study the UV/optical power spectra of AGNs under the assumption of X-ray reverberation and to test whether this model can explain the observed power spectra of distant quasars. To do this, we computed the disc transfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical model and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model allows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the scenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an external source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc transfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars determined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light curves. We demonstrate that X-ray reverberation can fit the power spectra of quasars in our sample well at all wavelengths, from $\sim 1300$\AA\ up to $4000$\AA. Our best-fit models imply that the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion disc, and that the black hole spin is probably lower than 0.7, while the X-ray corona height is in the range of $20 - 60 R_{g}$. This is in agreement with previous findings from the application of the X-ray reverberation model to the quasar micro-lensing disc size problem, as well as recent time-lag measurements.

  Image-based searches have become a complementary approach for identifying pulsars, particularly at MHz frequencies where scattering and high dispersion measures affect high-time resolution observations. In this work, we searched the Galactic Plane (GP) data release from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-Sky Murchison Widefield Array eXtended (GLEAM-X) survey, a widefield continuum radio survey covering the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range, at the positions of known pulsars in the ATNF catalogue (version 2.6.2) that lie within its sky coverage. We present the spectral energy distribution for 193 known pulsars located at |b| &lt; 11deg. Notably, 106 of these represent the first detections below 400 MHz. We also cross-match the GLEAM-X: GP compact source catalogue with unassociated sources in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalogue, filtering for gamma-ray spectral and variability properties, as well as coincidence with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We have identified 106 possible pulsar candidates. This work demonstrates the importance of sensitive, low-frequency Galactic plane surveys for detecting emission from known pulsars and presents a potential way of searching for new pulsar candidates that would otherwise be missed by traditional time-domain searches.

  [abridged] Accurately accounting for the AGN phase in galaxy evolution requires a large, clean AGN sample. This is now possible with SRG/eROSITA. The public Data Release 1 (DR1, Jan 31, 2024) includes 930,203 sources from the Western Galactic Hemisphere. The data enable the selection of a large AGN sample and the discovery of rare sources. However, scientific return depends on accurate characterisation of the X-ray emitters, requiring high-quality multiwavelength data. This paper presents the identification and classification of optical and infrared counterparts to eRASS1 sources using Gaia DR3, CatWISE2020, and Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) with the Bayesian NWAY algorithm and trained priors. Sources were classified as Galactic or extragalactic via a Machine Learning model combining optical/IR and X-ray properties, trained on a reference sample. For extragalactic LS10 sources, photometric redshifts were computed using Circlez. Within the LS10 footprint, all 656,614 eROSITA/DR1 sources have at least one possible optical counterpart; about 570,000 are extragalactic and likely AGN. Half are new detections compared to AllWISE, Gaia, and Quaia AGN catalogues. Gaia and CatWISE2020 counterparts are less reliable, due to the surveys shallowness and the limited amount of features available to assess the probability of being an X-ray emitter. In the Galactic Plane, where the overdensity of stellar sources also increases the chance of associations, using conservative reliability cuts, we identify approximately 18,000 Gaia and 55,000 CatWISE2020 extragalactic sources. We release three high-quality counterpart catalogues, plus the training and validation sets, as a benchmark for the field. These datasets have many applications, but in particular empower researchers to build AGN samples tailored for completeness and purity, accelerating the hunt for the Universe most energetic engines.

  Infrared Galaxies

  We explore mid-infrared (MIR) variability in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs; infrared luminsoity $L_{\rm IR}&gt;10^{12}\ L_\odot$) utilizing the $\sim$11 years of photometry from the NEOWISE multi-epoch catalog of {\it Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} ({\it WISE}). We identify 30 variable ULIRGs with statistically significant MIR variability. The variability is observed on timescales of a few years, implying that the MIR-emitting regions are compact ($\lesssim 1$ pc). The difference between maximum and minimum $W2$ (4.6 ${\rm \mu}$m) band luminosity ($\Delta L_{\rm W2}$) of the 30 variable ULIRGs range from $\Delta L_{W2}$ = $7\times10^{42}$ to $5\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The $\Delta L_{W2}$ of 25 variable ULIRGs out of 30 are greater than $\Delta L_{W2}$ = $1\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, surpassing the MIR luminosity {range} observed in known supernovae (SNe; $L_{\rm 3.6\ {\rm \mu m}}$ and $L_{\rm 4.5\ {\rm \mu m}}$ &lt; 10$^{42.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Therefore, the MIR variabilities in these 25 ULIRGs are most likely driven by tidal disruption events (TDEs) or intrinsic changes in their active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus emission. Our sample includes hard X-ray detected AGNs (e.g., UGC 05101) and previously reported TDE candidates (IRAS F01004-2237, IRAS 05189-2524). All 25 also exhibit at least one AGN signature(s) besides the MIR variability, suggesting that even if the MIR variability originates from TDEs, the black holes responsible are likely AGNs. Our results suggest that MIR variability is an effective tool for detecting buried AGNs and highlights the intense nuclear activity in ULIRGs.

  The time variable far-IR/mm sky is largely unexplored. However, when PRIMA launches, next generation ground-based CMB experiments, including Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will be operating. These will survey large areas of the sky for transient mm sources as a byproduct of their observations, producing regular mm-transient alerts. The results from current experiments show they can detect a wide variety of mm transients ranging from Galactic stars to extragalactic sources associated with AGNs and other energetic phenomena, and moving Solar System objects such as asteroids. These results, and theoretical predictions, indicate that future mm/submm facilities will detect many kinds of transient, including flaring stars, protostars, GRBs, TDEs, neutron star mergers, FBOTs, and SNe. New classes of mm-variable may be uncovered by CMB experiments, and transient searches at other wavelengths, such as the optical LSST survey, will produce additional targets to followup with PRIMA. Predicted rates for extragalactic mm transients to be detected by CMB experiments range from 10s to 1000s of events over the lifetime of these projects. CMB-S4 is most relevant for PRIMA, producing $\sim$100 extragalactic transients per year. Galactic transients and variable sources will also be detected, but the most common Galactic transients, flaring stars, operate on such short timescales that direct follow-up with PRIMA will not be feasible. Variable accretion rates in forming protostars, conversely, produce long term brightness variations that will be ideal monitoring targets. The addition of mid- and far-IR data points for all these sources can determine much about their radiation mechanisms and underlying physics. PRIMA followup of representative examples of various mm-transient and variable sources will thus have a powerful impact on our understanding of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena.

  We analyse 77 \textit{Fermi} sources and their potential low-energy counterparts previously proposed in the literature. These sources were classified as active galactic nuclei, mainly blazars, based on optical spectroscopy. The main goals of this work are to examine these associations, classify the blazars based on their multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and identify potential masquerading BL Lac objects. Through SED analysis, we assess whether the multi-wavelength emission follows the characteristic double-peaked curve of blazars. Additionally, we propose the region of origin of the emission at different wavelengths, investigate the correlation between $\gamma$-ray and lower-energy emission, and classify objects as low-, intermediate-, high- or extreme high synchrotron peaked (LSP, ISP, HSP, E-HSP) blazars. We search for masquerading BL Lacs, a class of flat-spectrum radio quasars where broad emission lines are swamped by non-thermal jet emission. The multi-wavelength analysis revealed that the 64 radio-loud sources in our sample exhibit an SED with a double-peak structure, typically ascribed to jet activity. Based on the synchrotron peak, 46 are HSP, 11 as ISP, and 7 as LSP. We also found 9--18 masquerading BL Lac candidates ($\approx$15--30\% of the radio-loud sample). For the 13 radio-quiet UGSs, the SEDs do not exhibit the double-peak structure typical of jetted AGN. Further analysis ruled out star formation as the origin of the observed $\gamma$-ray emission, making its reconciliation with lower-energy emission challenging. We explored alternative counterparts, identifying low-energy matches for 7 sources, with no plausible counterparts found for the others.

  We present a systematic search for broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample of 18 star-forming galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{9.5}~M_{\odot}$) at redshifts $z=4.4-5.7$. Using JWST/NIRSpec IFU, we identify 7 AGN candidates through the detection of broad \Ha\ emission lines from 33 aperture spectra centred on photometric peaks. These candidates include one highly robust AGN detection with FWHM $\sim$ 2800 \kms\ and six showing broad components with FWHM $\sim 600-1600$ \kms, with two in a merger system. We highlight that only broad-line detection is effective since these candidates uniformly lie within narrow emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams where star-forming galaxies and AGNs overlap. The broad-line AGN fraction ranges from 5.9\% to 33\%, depending on the robustness of the candidates. Assuming that the majority are AGNs, the relatively high AGN fraction is likely due to targeting high-mass galaxies, where simulations demonstrate that broad-line detection is more feasible. Their black hole masses range from $10^6$ to $10^{7.5}~M_{\odot}$ with $0.1 \lesssim L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}\lesssim 1$. Counter to previous JWST studies at high redshift that found overmassive black holes relative to their host galaxies, our candidates lie close to or below the local $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ scaling relations, thus demonstrating the effect of selection biases. This study provides new insights into AGN-host galaxy co-evolution at high redshift by identifying faint broad-line AGNs in galaxy samples, highlighting the importance of considering mass-dependent selection biases and the likelihood of a large population of AGNs being undermassive and just now being tapped by JWST.

  One of the main open issues in galaxy formation and evolution is the early assembly of the most massive galaxies and their contribution to the stellar mass and star formation rate densities at early epochs. Massive red sources already in place at z &gt; 2 to 3 have been found in deep Spitzer-IRAC and ALMA surveys. They are often called optically and near-IR dark, or HST-dark, being undetected even in the deepest HST frames. The submillimeter (i.e., ALMA) detection of these sources confirms their high-z dusty nature: they are massive (e.g., log(M*/Msun) &gt; 10) and dusty star-forming galaxies with estimated redshifts in the 2.5 to 7 range. They seem to lie mostly below the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies and show gas depletion times &lt;1 Gyr. Imaging with the PRIMA/PRIMAger instrument over the full 25 to 265 micron range will allow us to characterize their still uncovered spectral energy distributions between JWST and ALMA spectral windows, probing their dust content and properties (e.g., temperature, mass), whereas spectroscopic observations with FIRESS will be the key to investigate the nature of their powering source (e.g., AGN or star formation) and to study the physics of their ISM, by detecting and measuring fine structure lines in the mid- and far-IR domain.

  The cosmic evolution of obscured star formation, dust properties and production mechanisms, and the prevalence of dust-obscured AGN out to high redshifts are currently some of the hot topics in astrophysics. While much progress has been made in the early days with Spitzer and Herschel, these facilities have not reached the necessary depths to observe the mid-IR light of high-redshift (z &gt; 3) galaxies. Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has filled in the blue side of the rest-frame mid-IR. The Atacama Large (Sub)Millimeter Array (ALMA), on the other hand, provides excellent sensitivity in the far-IR regime, allowing the study of dust and gas properties at high redshifts. Filling the wavelength gap between JWST and ALMA is crucial to progress our understanding of early galaxy evolution - and this will be an important goal in the next decades. The Probe far-IR Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA), with sensitive imaging and spectroscopic capabilities at 24-240$\mu$m and currently in Phase A study, will achieve this and provide insights into early galaxy evolution, Black Hole growth, and dust production mechanisms. Here we present PRIDES, a possible deep and wide-area survey over 1.6 square-degrees of the COSMOS field with PRIMA to study these science cases.

  JWST has uncovered a diverse population of extreme near-infrared dropouts, including ultra high-redshift ($z&gt;15$) galaxy candidates, dust-obscured galaxies challenging dust production theories, sources with strong Balmer breaks - possibly compact AGN in dense environments - and cold, sub-stellar Galactic objects. This work presents Capotauro, a F356W-dropout in the CEERS survey with F444W AB magnitude of $\sim27.68$ and a sharp $&gt;3$ mag flux drop between $3.5{-}4.5\,\mu$m, undetected below $3.5\,\mu$m. We combine JWST/NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/MSA data with HST/ACS and WFC3 observations to perform a spectro-photometric analysis of Capotauro using multiple SED-fitting codes. Our setup tests $z\geq15$ as well as $z&lt;10$ dusty, Balmer-break or strong-line galaxy solutions, and the possibility of Capotauro being a Milky Way sub-stellar object. Among extragalactic options, our analysis favors interpreting the sharp drop as a Lyman break at $z\sim32$, consistent with the epoch of formation of the first stars and black holes, with only $\sim0.5\%$ of the posterior volume at $z&lt;25$. Lower-redshift solutions struggle to reproduce the extreme break, suggesting that if Capotauro lies at $z&lt;10$, it must show a non-standard combination of strong dust attenuation and/or Balmer breaks, making it a peculiar interloper. Alternatively, its properties match a very cold (Y2-Y3 type) brown dwarf or a free-floating exoplanet with a record-breaking combination of low temperature and large distance ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;300\,\mathrm{K}$, $d\gtrsim130\,\mathrm{pc}$, up to $\sim2\,\mathrm{kpc}$). While current data cannot determine its nature, Capotauro emerges as a remarkably unique object in all plausible scenarios, and a compelling target for follow-up.

  This study examines the resolved Kennicutt Schmidt (rKS) relation, defined as the connection between the star formation rate surface density (Sigma SFR) and the molecular gas mass surface density (Sigma H2) in the high-density central regions of three nearby barred spiral galaxies hosting AGN: NGC 1365, NGC 1433, and NGC 1566. Utilising high-resolution archival data from AstroSat/UVIT for UV imaging and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) for CO(2-1) molecular gas mapping, we explore recent star formation and gas distribution with a spatial resolution of about 120 to 132 pc. Our findings reveal a sublinear rKS law, with slopes ranging from about 0.17 to 0.71. Notably, NGC 1566 exhibits a robust rKS relation consistent with previous studies, while NGC 1365 and NGC 1433 show weaker correlations. These differences are likely due to the smaller number of identified star-forming regions in these galaxies compared to NGC 1566, as well as the central molecular gas concentrations and varying star formation activity in their bars and nuclear regions. These results also support the idea that the rKS relation deviates from linearity in extreme environments, such as starburst galaxies and galactic centres. Additionally, we find a generally low median star formation efficiency (SFE) within the bars of these galaxies, suggesting that while bars may drive nuclear starbursts and contribute to bulge growth, they do not significantly increase SFE. Furthermore, a negative correlation between SFE and Sigma H2 is observed across the sample, both within and outside the bar regions, suggesting that higher Sigma H2 may lead to lower SFE in the central regions of these galaxies. Our findings highlight that Sigma H2 plays a primary role in shaping the observed trends in SFE, rather than the presence of a bar itself.

  Galaxy evolution and extragalactic astronomy research depend on an understanding of the interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. We investigate the relationships between X-ray luminosity (Lx), star formation rate (SFR), and stellar mass (M) in distinct samples of radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. Using data from 4XMM-DR11, SDSS-DR16, and the DESI AGN Host Galaxies VAC, we examine how these key properties correlate within each AGN population. Our analysis reveals different behaviors: RL-AGN show a strong, statistically significant Lx-SFR correlation but no significant link with M, suggesting that accretion and star formation are coupled, possibly independent of host mass. In contrast, RQ-AGN display moderate, significant positive correlations across all parameters, consistent with joint growth driven by a shared cold gas supply.These results suggest that radio-loud AGN might slow down star formation in their galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN seem to grow together with it.   

Very Massive, Rapidly Spinning Binary Black Hole Progenitors through

  Among the over 200 gravitational wave detections reported so far, GW231123 is a remarkable event that not only holds the record for the most massive black hole merger, but also exhibits extreme spins. Its origin is actively debated. Proposed scenarios include dynamical formation involving a sequence of mergers, Population III stars, accretion in an AGN disk and also more exotic explanations including primordial black holes and cosmic strings, each facing different challenges. Recent work showed that the incoming black holes of GW231123 can be formed out of massive rapidly rotating collapsing helium stars. Here, we address the question how such very massive rapidly rotating helium stars can be formed in very close binary systems. For this we explore chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) involving progenitors with masses above the pair-instability mass gap. We compute a grid of detailed massive binary models with the stellar evolution code MESA to follow the early evolution of binary progenitors and show that: (i) very massive ($M_i &gt; 140\, M_\odot$) CHE binaries at low metallicity ($Z=10^{-5}$) naturally produce rapidly rotating progenitors with high masses and high spins matching the properties of the black holes in GW231123 and (ii) the maximum spin of the progenitors is bound by their critical rotation rate leading to a tight correlation between the dimensionless spin and mass, $a \propto M^{-0.9}$, in models that have no hydrogen left. We conclude that the CHE channel appears to be a viable and natural scenario to produce progenitors. We compare and discuss the differences with earlier studies and comment on the large uncertainties in the final fate and collapse.
