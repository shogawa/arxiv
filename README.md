  We investigate the connection between accretion signatures and host galaxy properties in the context of how active dwarf galaxies are identified. We use the database constructed in Wasleske &amp; Baldassare (2024) which contains dwarf galaxies that were selected as active galaxies by optical spectroscopy, infrared colors, X-ray brightness, and photometric variability. Multi-wavelength archival data was used to consistently apply all of these methods to every galaxy within this compiled set. The cross application of these methods resulted in a diversity of sub-populations identified as active by some set of these techniques. In this paper, we estimate host galaxy properties from spectral energy distribution models. We connect the active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures to our estimated host galaxies' properties using statistical dimensionality reduction methods. We find that dwarf AGN selected by infrared colors are the most distinct population, with the highest star formation rates and lowest stellar masses. We also find some other key population differences, such as the broad line AGN having significantly higher AGN luminosities. X-ray and variability selected AGN have higher average star formation rates than those selected with optical narrow line spectroscopic diagrams. Our connections to the host galaxy parameters potentially point to the sub-populations representing different epochs of the evolution of accretion.

  X-ray surveys are one of the most unbiased methods for detecting Compton Thick (CT; $N_{{\mathrm{H}}} \geq 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGN, which are thought to comprise up to $60\%$ of AGN within $z \lesssim 1.0$. These CT AGN are often difficult to detect with current instruments, but the X-ray data within the JWST-North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time Domain Field (TDF) present a unique opportunity to study faint and obscured AGN. The NEP contains the deepest NuSTAR survey to date, and Zhao et al. (2024) detected 60 hard X-ray sources from the combined exposure of NuSTAR's Cycle 5 and 6 observations. In this work, we utilize the NuSTAR Cycle 5+6+8+9 data and simultaneous XMM-Newton observations in order to perform the first spectroscopic analysis of the 60-source catalog. We present this analysis and measure the $N_{{\mathrm{H}}}$ distribution of the sample. We measure an observed CT fraction of $0.13_{-0.04}^{+0.15}$ down to an observed $8-24$ keV flux of $6.0 \times 10^{-14}$ erg/s/cm$^{2}$, and we correct our analysis for absorption bias to estimate an underlying CT fraction of $0.32_{-0.08}^{+0.23}$. The derived obscuration distribution and CT fraction are consistent with population synthesis models and previous surveys.

  Optical variability is a key observational probe for studying the accretion dynamics and central engine physics of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The quality and completeness of light curves have a direct impact on variability studies, particularly for faint AGNs and high-redshift AGNs. To improve the quality of long-term light curves for AGNs, we bin and stack multi-epoch images balancing the image depths and temporal resolution. As a case study, we apply this method to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, where the overlapping region covers an area of about 370 arcmin$^2$ and includes $g$-band and $r$-band data taken from March 2018 to December 2024. The co-added images are approximately 2.0 to 2.5 magnitudes deeper than the ZTF single-epoch images. With co-added images, we construct light curves for 73 AGNs in the EGS field. Compared to the traditional ZTF light curves, our light curves maintain consistent long-term variability trends but with higher photometric precision. Furthermore, this method can help detect AGNs with weak variability which are missed from the traditional ZTF data due to the noisy light curves or below the detection limit in ZTF's single-epoch exposure. Among the 73 AGNs, the majority exhibit a bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend on long-term timescales, which is consistent with previous studies. This work offers insights for optimizing AGN light curves in both current and upcoming all-sky time-domain surveys.

  We present combined JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy data of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of the highly dust obscured Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7582, which is part of the sample of AGN in the Galaxy Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Spatially resolved analysis of the pure rotational H$_2$ lines (S(1)-S(7)) reveals a characteristic power-law temperature distribution in different apertures, with the two prominent southern star-forming regions exhibiting unexpectedly high molecular gas temperatures, comparable to those in the AGN powered nuclear region. We investigate potential heating mechanisms including direct AGN photoionisation, UV fluorescent excitation from young star clusters, and shock excitation. We find that shock heating gives the most plausible explanation, consistent with multiple near- and mid-IR tracers and diagnostics. Using photoionisation models from the PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox, we quantify the ISM conditions in the different regions, determining that the southern star-forming regions have a high density ($n_H \sim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and are irradiated by a moderate UV radiation field ($G_0 \sim 10^{3}$ Habing). Fitting a suite of Paris-Durham shock models to the rotational H$_2$ lines, as well as rovibrational 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(2), and 2-1 S(1) H$_2$ emission lines, we find that a slow ($v_s \sim 10$ km/s) C-type shock is likely responsible for the elevated temperatures. Our analysis loosely favours local starburst activity as the driver of the shocks and circumnuclear gas dynamics in NGC 7582, though the possibility of an AGN jet contribution cannot be excluded.

  The interplay between the accretion of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the stellar mass growth of the host galaxies is still a matter of hot debate. The accretion of the SMBHs is expected to release energy under the form of AGNs. This energy is believed to impact the star formation activity and contribute to the quenching of galaxies. Here, we address this key unsolved issue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow galaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via abundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of their host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the empirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption that galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit imposed by the observed $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ relation, as a proxy of SMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched galaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid. In addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling relations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an $M_{\rm BH} - M_\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift. The model also naturally generates SMBH accretion rates peaking within 1 Gyr of their host SFHs. We note that all the main predictions on galaxy quenched fractions and SMBH growth histories and scaling relations are degenerate with those expected in a halo quenching model. The comprehensive data-driven model presented in this work represents an invaluable tool to investigate SMBH demography across time and environments in an accurate, physically motivated manner, ideally suited to rapidly explore the implications from large surveys, such as Euclid and Rubin-LSST.   

Accretion rates of stellar-mass compact objects embedded in AGN discs

  Stellar-mass compact objects (COs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs are commonly assumed to accrete via Bondi or Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) prescriptions, neglecting gas angular momentum. We show that differential rotation in AGN discs can impart non-negligible angular momentum, in which case accretion proceeds through a viscous disc rather than Bondi/BHL flow. Our model provides a new framework estimating the CO accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{CO} = \min\{\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}, \dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}\}$, where the viscous rate $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}$ accounts for gas--CO relative motion decomposed into a local gradient term (due to differential rotation) and bulk motion (from differing orbital parameters). This rate can be expressed as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} = \alpha \xi (r_\mathrm{H}/r_\mathrm{BHL})^3\dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}$, where $\xi$ is a coefficient of order unity. It can also be approximately scaled to the global AGN accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} \propto \dot{M}_1$, with the scaling coefficients in both forms determined by the specific dynamical configuration. The accretion is viscosity-limited when $q &gt; [\alpha \xi(1+\mathcal{M}^2)^{3}/3]^{1/2} h^3$, where $q$ is the mass ratio between the CO and the supermassive black hole, $\alpha$ the viscosity parameter, $\mathcal{M}$ the Mach number of the bulk relative motion, and $h$ the aspect ratio of the AGN disc. In thin AGN discs this condition is satisfied for most stellar-mass or more massive COs. Our framework also naturally allows for the inclusion of established outflow corrections, thereby enabling a more realistic treatment of super-Eddington flows. Our formulation thus improves upon Bondi/BHL prescriptions and offers a more physically motivated basis for studying CO evolution in AGN environments.   

Demystifying flux eruptions: Magnetic flux transport in magnetically
  arrested disks

  Magnetically arrested disks (MADs) are a compelling model for explaining variability in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), including horizon-scale outbursts like those observed in Sagittarius A*. MADs experience powerful flux eruptions-episodic ejections of magnetic flux from the black hole horizon-that may drive the observed luminosity variations. In this work, we develop and validate a new formalism describing large-scale magnetic field transport in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of MADs with geometrical thicknesses of $h/R=0.1$ and $h/R=0.3$. We introduce a net flux transport velocity, $v_\Phi$, which accounts for both advective and diffusive processes. We show that MADs maintain a statistical quasi-steady state where advection and diffusion nearly balance. Flux eruptions appear as small deviations from this equilibrium, with $v_\Phi/V_k\ll1$, where $V_k$ is the local Keplerian velocity. Using this framework, we analytically derive a recurrence timescale for flux eruptions, $t_{\rm rec}\sim1500\, r_g/c$. This timescale closely matches simulation results. The smallness of $v_\Phi$ explains the long recurrence times of flux eruptions compared to other system timescales. We also take a closer look at the diffusion of the magnetic field by performing the first measurement of turbulent resistivity in MADs. We then estimate the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, defined as the ratio of turbulent viscosity to turbulent resistivity. We find $\mathcal{P}_m\sim3$, consistent with shearing-box simulations of magneto rotational instability-driven turbulence. While flux eruptions excite large-scale non-axisymmetric modes and locally enhance turbulent resistivity, magnetic field diffusion is dominated by smaller-scale turbulent motions. These results provide new insight into the nature of AGN variability and the fundamental physics of magnetic field transport.

  X-ray observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2019avd show drastic variabilities in flux and spectral shape over hundreds of days, providing clues on the accretion disc-corona evolution. We utilize a disc-corona model, in which a fraction of the gravitational energy released in the disc is transported into the hot corona above/below. Some soft photons emitted from the disc are upscattered to X-ray photons by the hot electrons in the optically thin corona. By fitting the NICER observations of AT 2019avd during epochs when the spectra exhibit significant hardening, we derive the evolution of the mass accretion rate, $\dot{m}$, and the coronal energy fraction, $f$. Our results show that $f$ decreases with increasing $\dot{m}$, which is qualitatively consistent with that observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), while the slope of this source, $f\propto \dot{m}^{-0.30}$, is much shallower than that of AGNs. We also find that the non-thermal X-ray spectrum in this source is significantly softer than those typically seen in AGNs and black-hole X-ray binaries. We argue that these quantitative differences can be a powerful diagnostic of the underlying magnetic turbulence, which may imply a stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion disc than that in typical AGNs. It is also found that the evolution of the fitted neutral hydrogen column density follows a similar pattern to that of the accretion rate evolution, which may reflect the accumulation of absorbing material originating from the inflowing streams of stellar debris and/or other related sources.
