  In the inner region of the disc of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), the collision of two white dwarfs (WDs) through Jacobi capture might be inevitable, leading to a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion. This transient event, influenced by the disc gas and the gravity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH), exhibits distinct characteristics compared to normal SNe Ia. The energy of the explosion is mainly stored in the ejecta in the form of kinetic energy. Typically, the ejecta is not effectively decelerated by the AGN disc and rushes rapidly out of the AGN disc. However, under the influence of the SMBH, most of the ejecta falls back toward the AGN disc. As the fallback ejecta becomes more dispersed, it interacts with the disc gas, converting its kinetic energy into thermal energy. This results in a high-energy transient characterized by a rapid initial rise followed by a decay with $L\propto t^{-2.8}$. The time-scale of the transient ranges from hours to weeks, depending on the mass of the SMBH. This process generates high-energy radiation spanning from hard X-rays to the soft $\gamma$ range. Additionally, the subsequent damage to the disc may result in changing-look AGNs. Moreover, the falling back of SNe Ia ejecta onto the AGN disc significantly increases the metallicity of the AGN and can even generate heavy elements within the AGN discs.

  White dwarfs (WDs) in active galactic nucleus (AGNs) discs might migrate to the inner radii of the discs and form restricted three-body systems with two WDs moving around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in close orbits. These systems could be dynamical unstable, which can lead to very close encounters or direct collisions. In this work, we use N-body simulations to study the evolution of such systems with the different initial orbital separation $p$, relative orbital inclination $\Delta{i}$ and SMBH mass $M$. It is found that the close encounters of WDs mainly occur at $1.1R_{\rm H} \lesssim p \lesssim 2\sqrt{3}R_{\rm H}$, where $R_{\rm H}$ is the mutual Hill radius. For $p&lt;1.1R_{\rm H}$, the majority of WDs move in horseshoe or tadpole orbits, and only few of them with small initial orbital phase difference undergo close encounters. For $p=3.0R_{\rm H}$, WD-WD collisions occur in most of the samples within a time of $10^5P_1$, and considerable collisions occur within a time of $t&lt;62P_1$ for small orbital radii, where $P_1$ is the orbital period. The peak of the closest separation distribution increase and the WD-WD collision fraction decreases with an increase of the relative inclination. The closest separation distribution is similar in cases with the different SMBH mass, but the WD-WD collision fraction decreases as the mass of SMBHs increases. According to our estimation, the event rate of the cosmic WD-WD collision in AGN discs is about $300{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, roughly $1\%$ of the one of the observed type Ia supernova. The corresponding electromagnetic emission signals can be observed by large surveys of AGNs.

  We present radio observations of 23 optically-discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) on timescales of about 500-3200 days post-discovery. We detect 9 new TDEs that did not have detectable radio emission at earlier times, indicating a late-time brightening after several hundred (and up to 2300 days); an additional 6 TDEs exhibit radio emission whose origin is ambiguous or may be attributed to the host galaxy or an AGN. We also report new rising components in two TDEs previously detected in the radio (iPTF16fnl and AT2019dsg) at ~1000 days. While the radio emission in some of the detected TDEs peaked on a timescale of ~2-4 years, more than half of the sample still shows rising emission. The range of luminosities for the sample is 10^37-10^39 erg/s, about two orders of magnitude below the radio luminosity of the relativistic TDE Sw1644+57. Our data set indicates that about 40% of all optical TDEs are detected in the radio hundreds to thousands of days after discovery, and that this is probably more common than early radio emission peaking at ~100 days. Using an equipartition analysis, we find evidence for a delayed launch of the radio-emitting outflows, with delay timescales of ~500-2000 days, inferred velocities of ~0.02-0.15c, and kinetic energies of ~10^47-10^49 erg. We rule out off-axis relativistic jets as a viable explanation for this population, and conclude delayed outflows are a more likely explanation, such as from delayed disk formation. Finally, we find comparable densities in the circumnuclear environments of these TDEs as for those with early radio emission, and find the TDEs still rising in luminosity are consistent with free expansion. We conclude that late radio emission marks a fairly ubiquitous but heretofore overlooked phase of TDE evolution.
