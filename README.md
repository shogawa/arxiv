  The Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) channel for the formation of binary black hole (BBH) mergers has been previously studied as a potential formation channel for the merging compact binaries observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) scientific collaboration. The first two papers in this series explored the McFACTS code for the evolution of black hole orbits in AGN accretion disks for individual galaxy models and described the characteristics of predicted BBH populations in realizations of those models (such as the correlation between mass ratio and aligned spin). In this work, we explore the impact of the properties of AGN host galaxies and assume an AGN lifetime and cosmological model for the density of AGN in a universe like our own. By sampling from an inferred population of AGN, we marginalize over galaxy mass to predict a population of BBH mergers observable by modern ground-based gravitational wave observatories. We find that for reasonable assumptions, AGN disk environments may account for massive BBH mergers such as GW190521 and GW190929_012149. We find that the majority of observable BBH mergers from our simulation are expected to originate in galaxies with a super-massive black hole between $10^{7}M_{\odot}$ and $10^{9.4}M_{\odot}$. We also find that if hierarchical mergers from AGN disks account for a substantial part of the LVK population, our current models require an AGN lifetime of 0.5 to 2.5 Myr.

  We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopic characterization of GHZ9 at z= 10.145 $\pm$ 0.010, currently the most distant source detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum reveals several UV high-ionization lines, including CII, SiIV, [NIV], CIV, HeII, OIII], NIII], and CIII]. The prominent rest-frame equivalent widths (EW(CIV)$\simeq$65A, EW(HeII)$\simeq$18A, EW(CIII])$\simeq$48A) show the presence of a hard radiation field, while the analysis of line ratio diagnostics suggest this galaxy hosts both AGN and star-formation activity. GHZ9 is nitrogen-enriched (6--9.5 times solar), carbon-poor (0.2--0.65 times solar), metal-poor (Z = 0.01--0.1 Z$_{\odot}$), and compact ($&lt;$ 106 pc), similarly to GNz11, GHZ2, and recently discovered N-enhanced high redshift objects. We exploited the newly available JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam dataset to perform an independent analysis of the Chandra data confirming that GHZ9 is the most likely JWST source associated to X-ray emission at 0.5-7 keV. Assuming a spectral index $\Gamma$ = 2.3 (1.8), we estimate a black hole (BH) mass of 1.60 $\pm$ 0.31 (0.48 $\pm$ 0.09) $\times$ 10$^8$M$_{\odot}$, which is consistent either with Eddington-accretion onto heavy ($\geq$ 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$) BH seeds formed at z=18, or super-Eddington accretion onto a light seed of $\sim$ 10$^2-10^4$ M$_{\odot}$ at z = 25. The corresponding BH-to-stellar mass ratio M$_{BH}$/M$_{star}$= 0.33$\pm$0.22 (0.10$\pm$0.07), with a stringent limit $&gt;$0.02, implies an accelerated growth of the BH mass with respect to the stellar mass. GHZ9 is the ideal target to constrain the early phases of AGN-galaxy coevolution with future multi-frequency observations.

  The presence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in low mass (Mstar $\lesssim$ $10^{9}$ Msun) galaxies at high redshift has been established, and it is important to characterise these objects and the impact of their feedback on the host galaxies. In this paper we apply the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code BEAGLE-AGN to SMACS S06355, a z $\sim$ 7.66 Type-II AGN candidate from the JWST NIRSpec Early Release Observations. This object's spectrum includes a detection of the [NeIV]2426 line, indicating an obscured AGN due to its high ionization potential energy ($\sim$ 63eV). We use BEAGLE-AGN to simultaneously model the Narrow Line Region (NLR) AGN and star-forming galaxy contributions to the observed line fluxes and photometry. Having a high-ionization emission line allows the contribution of the NLR to the remaining lines to be probabilistically disentangled. The HII region metallicity is derived to be 12+log(O/H)$^{\mathrm{HII}}$ = $7.74^{+0.18}_{-0.19}$. Assuming that the Neon-to-Oxygen abundance is similar to solar we derive a high NLR metallicity of 12+log(O/H)$^\mathrm{{NLR}}$ = $8.77^{+0.14}_{-0.16}$, with the 2$\sigma$ lower-limit extending to 12+log(O/H)$^{\mathrm{NLR}}$ $\sim$ 8.00, showing the derivation is uncertain. We discuss this result with respect to non-solar Neon abundances that might boost the inferred NLR metallicity. The NLR metallicity places SMACS S06355 in a comparable region of the mass-metallicity plane to intermediate (1.5 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 3.0) redshift obscured AGN. Our derived accretion disc luminosity, log($L_{acc}$ / erg $s^{-1}$) = $45.19^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, is moderately high yet still uncertain. We highlight that deviations between bolometric luminosity calibrations and model grid tracks become enhanced at low metallicities.

  Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) are enshrouded by dust, and many are believed to host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which makes them unique objects for probing the coevolution of galaxies and SMBHs. We select and characterize DOGs in the $13\,deg^2$ XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS), leveraging the superb multiwavelength data from X-rays to radio. We select 3738 DOGs at $z\approx1.6-2.1$ in XMM-SERVS, while maintaining good data quality without introducing significant bias. This represents the largest DOG sample with thorough multiwavelength source characterization. Spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling shows DOGs are a heterogeneous population consisting of both normal galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our DOGs are massive ($\log M_\bigstar/M_\odot\approx10.7-11.3$), 174 are detected in X-rays, and they are generally radio-quiet systems. X-ray detected DOGs are luminous and are moderately to heavily obscured in X-rays. Stacking analyses for the X-ray undetected DOGs show highly significant average detections. Critically, we compare DOGs with matched galaxy populations. DOGs have similar AGN fractions compared with typical galaxy populations. X-ray detected DOGs have higher $M_\bigstar$ and higher X-ray obscuration, but they are not more star-forming than typical X-ray AGNs. The results potentially challenge the relevance of the merger-driven galaxy-SMBH coevolution framework for X-ray detected DOGs.

  The BL Lac Object PKS 1717+177 has been identified as potential neutrino-emitting AGN in the point source stacking analysis of IceCube data. We explore peculiarities in the morphology and kinematics of the jet and examine multi-wavelength light curves for distinctive effects which might allow to pinpoint a likely neutrino generation mechanism. We re-modeled 34 high resolution radio interferometric Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations obtained at 15 GHz (between 1999/12/27 and 2023/05/03). A correlation and periodicity analysis of optical KAIT and Tuorla data, as well as for Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data has been performed. The nuclear jet appears deflected and bent at about 0.5 mas distance from the radio core by an encounter with a dark, unseen object. The deviation of the jet evolves over 23.5 years from a simple apparent bend into a significantly meandering structure with increasing amplitude: a zig-zag line. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the temporal evolution of a jet deviation can be traced. The turning point shifts with time and the jet seems to brighten up almost periodically at the point of deviation. The radio core as well as the jet contribute approximately equally to the total flux-density at 15 GHz. We discuss scenarios which could explain the complex jet bending and quasi-regular flaring. We propose that the jet could either be deflected by the magnetosphere of a second massive black hole, by the pressure gradient due to a circumnuclear dense cloud, or via gravitational lensing by an intervening black hole.

  Burst searches identify gravitational-wave (GW) signals in the detector data without use of a specific signal model, unlike the matched-filter searches that correlate data with simulated signal waveforms (templates). While matched filters are optimal for detection of known signals in the Gaussian noise, the burst searches can be more efficient in finding unusual events not covered by templates or those affected by non-Gaussian noise artifacts. Here, we report the detection of 3 gravitational wave signals that are uncovered by a burst search Coherent WaveBurst (cWB) optimized for the detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. They were found in the data from the LIGO/Virgo's third observing run (O3) with a combined significance of 3.6 $\sigma$. Each event appears to be a BBH merger not previously reported by the LIGO/Virgo's matched-filter searches. The most significant event has a reconstructed primary component in the upper mass gap ($m_1 = 70^{+36}_{-18}\,$M$_\odot$), and unusually low mass ratio ($m_2/m_1\sim0.3$), implying a dynamical or AGN origin. The 3 new events are consistent with the expected number of cWB-only detections in the O3 run ($4.8 \pm 2.1$), and belong to the stellar-mass binary population with the total masses in the $70-100$ M$_\odot$ range.
