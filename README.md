  We analyze TYPHOON long slit absorption line spectra of the starburst barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 obtained with the Progressive Integral Step Method covering an area of 15 square kpc. Applying a population synthesis technique, we determine the spatial distribution of ages and metallicity of the young and old stellar population together with star formation rates, reddening, extinction and the ratio R$_V$ of extinction to reddening. We detect a clear indication of inside-out growth of the stellar disk beyond 3 kpc characterized by an outward increasing luminosity fraction of the young stellar population, a decreasing average age and a history of mass growth, which was finished 2 Gyrs later in the outermost disk. The metallicity of the young stellar population is clearly super solar but decreases towards larger galactocentric radii with a gradient of -0.02 dex/kpc. On the other hand, the metal content of the old population does not show a gradient and stays constant at a level roughly 0.4 dex lower than that of the young population. In the center of NGC 1365 we find a confined region where the metallicity of the young population drops dramatically and becomes lower than that of the old population. We attribute this to infall of metal poor gas and, additionally, to interrupted chemical evolution where star formation is stopped by AGN and supernova feedback and then after several Gyrs resumes with gas ejected by stellar winds from earlier generations of stars. We provide a simple model calculation as support for the latter.

  Using empty-field `Quick Look' images from the first two epochs of the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS) observations, centred on the positions of $\sim3700$ individually radio-non-detected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at $z\ge4$, we performed image stacking analysis to examine the sub-mJy emission at $3$ GHz. We found characteristic monochromatic radio powers of $P_\mathrm{char}=(2-13) \times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, $P_\mathrm{char}=2\times10^{24}-1.3\times10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, indicating that AGN-related radio emission is widespread in the sample. The signal-to-noise ratios of the redshift-binned median stacked maps are between $4-6$, and we expect that with the inclusion of the yet to be completed third-epoch VLASS observations, the detection limit defined as signal-to-noise ratio $\mathrm{SNR}\ge6$ could be reached, and the redshift dependence can be determined. To obtain information on the general spectral properties of the faint radio emission in high-redshift AGNs, we confined the sample to $\sim3000$ objects covered by both the VLASS and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey. We found that the flux densities from the median stacked maps show a characteristic spectral index of $\alpha^*=-0.30\pm0.15$, which is in agreement with the median spectral index of the radio-detected $z\ge4$ AGNs from our high-redshift AGN catalogue. The three-band mid-infrared colour--colour diagram based on Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer observations provides further support regarding the AGN contribution to the radio emission in the sub-mJy sample.

  We report a new, rare detection of HI 21-cm absorption associated with a quasar (only six known at $1&lt;z&lt;2$) here towards J2339-5523 at $z_{em}$ = 1.3531, discovered through the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS). The absorption profile is broad ($\sim 400$ km/s), and the peak is redshifted by $\sim 200$ km/s, from $z_{em}$. Interestingly, optical/FUV spectra of the quasar from Magellan-MIKE/HST-COS spectrographs do not show any absorption features associated with the 21-cm absorption. This is despite the coincident presence of the optical quasar and the radio `core' inferred from a flat spectrum component of flux density $\sim 65$ mJy at high frequencies ($&gt;5$ GHz). The simplest explanation would be that no large HI column (N(HI)$&gt;10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) is present towards the radio `core' and the optical AGN. Based on the joint optical and radio analysis of a heterogeneous sample of 16 quasars ($z_{median}$ = 0.7) and 15 radio galaxies ($z_{median}$ = 0.3) with HI 21-cm absorption detection and matched in 1.4 GHz luminosity (L$_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}$), a consistent picture emerges where quasars are primarily tracing the gas in the inner circumnuclear disk and cocoon created by the jet-ISM interaction. These exhibit L$_{1.4\,\rm GHz}$ - $\Delta V_{\rm null}$ correlation, and frequent mismatch between the radio and optical spectral lines. The radio galaxies show no such correlation and likely trace the gas from the cocoon and the galaxy-wide ISM outside the photoionization cone. The analysis presented here demonstrates the potential of radio spectroscopic observations to reveal the origin of the absorbing gas associated with AGN that may be missed in optical observations.

  In the absence of supplementary heat, the radiative cooling of halo gas around massive galaxies (Milky Way mass and above) leads to an excess of cold gas or stars beyond observed levels. AGN jet-induced heating is likely essential, but the specific properties of the jets remain unclear. Our previous work (Su et al. 2021) concludes from simulations of a halo with $10^{14} M_\odot$ that a successful jet model should have an energy flux comparable to the free-fall energy flux at the cooling radius and should inflate a sufficiently wide cocoon with a long enough cooling time. In this paper, we investigate three jet modes with constant fluxes satisfying the criteria, including high-temperature thermal jets, cosmic ray (CR)-dominant jets, and widely precessing kinetic jets in $10^{12}-10^{15}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ halos using high-resolution, non-cosmological MHD simulations with the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model, conduction, and viscosity. We find that scaling the jet energy according to the free-fall energy at the cooling radius can successfully suppress the cooling flows and quench galaxies without obviously violating observational constraints. We investigate an alternative scaling method in which we adjust the energy flux based on the total cooling rate within the cooling radius. However, we observe that the strong interstellar medium (ISM) cooling dominates the total cooling rate in this scaling approach, resulting in a jet flux that exceeds the amount needed to suppress the cooling flows. With the same energy flux, the CR-dominant jet is most effective in suppressing the cooling flow across all the surveyed halo masses due to the enhanced CR pressure support. We confirm that the criteria for a successful jet model, which we proposed in Su et al. (2021), work across a much wider range, encompassing halo masses of $10^{12}-10^{15} {\rm M_\odot}$.
