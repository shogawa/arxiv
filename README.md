  We combine our dynamical modeling black hole mass measurements from the LickAGN Monitoring Project 2016 sample with measured cross-correlation time lagsand line widths to recover individual scale factors, f, used in traditionalreverberation mapping analyses. We extend our sample by including prior resultsfrom Code for AGN Reverberation and Modeling of Emission Lines (caramel)studies that have utilized our methods. Aiming to improve the precision ofblack hole mass estimates, as well as uncover any regularities in the behaviorof the broad-line region (BLR), we search for correlations between f and otherAGN/BLR parameters. We find (i) evidence for a correlation between the virialcoefficient log10(fmean,{\sigma}) and black hole mass, (ii) marginal evidencefor a similar correlation between log10(frms,{\sigma}) and black hole mass,(iii) marginal evidence for an anti-correlation of BLR disk thickness withlog10(fmean,FWHM)and log10(frms,FWHM), and (iv) marginal evidence for ananti-correlation of inclination angle with log10(fmean,FWHM),log10(frms,{\sigma}), and log10(fmean,{\sigma}). Lastly, we find marginalevidence for a correlation between line-profile shape, when using theroot-meansquare spectrum, log10(FWHM/{\sigma})rms, and the virial coefficient,log10(frms,{\sigma}), and investigate how BLR properties might be related toline-profile shape using caramel models.

  LBQS 0302-0019 is a blue quasar (QSO) at z $\sim$ 3.3, hosting powerfuloutflows, and residing in a complex environment consisting of an obscured AGNcandidate, and multiple companions, all within 30 kpc in projection. We useJWST NIRSpec IFS observations to characterise the ionized gas in this complexsystem. We develop a procedure to correct for the spurious oscillations (or'wiggles') in NIRSpec single-spaxel spectra, due to the spatial under-samplingof the point spread function. We perform a quasar-host decomposition with theQDeblend3D tools, and use multi-component kinematic decomposition of theoptical emission line profiles to infer the physical properties of the emittinggas. The quasar-host decomposition allows us to identify i) a low-velocitycomponent possibly tracing a warm rotating disk, with a dynamical mass Mdyn$\sim 10^{11}$ Msun and a rotation-to-random motion ratio $v_{rot}$/$\sigma_0\sim 2$; ii) a spatially unresolved ionised outflow, with a velocity of $\sim$1000 km/s and an outflow mass rate of $\sim 10^4$ Msun/yr. We also detect eightinteracting companion objects close to LBQS 0302-0019. Optical line ratiosconfirm the presence of a second, obscured AGN at $\sim 20$ kpc of the primaryQSO; the dual AGN dominates the ionization state of the gas in the entireNIRSpec field-of-view. This work has unveiled with unprecedented detail thecomplex environment of this dual AGN, which includes nine interactingcompanions (five of which were previously unknown), all within 30 kpc of theQSO. Our results support a scenario where mergers can trigger dual AGN, and canbe important drivers for rapid early SMBH growth.

  We present an updated version of Lightning, a galaxy spectral energydistribution (SED) fitting code that can model X-ray to submillimeterobservations. The models in Lightning include the options to containcontributions from stellar populations, dust attenuation and emission, andactive galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray emission, when utilized, can be modeled asoriginating from stellar compact binary populations with the option to includeemission from AGN. We have also included a variety of algorithms to fit themodels to observations and sample parameter posteriors; these include anadaptive Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC), affine-invariant MCMC, andLevenberg-Marquardt gradient decent (MPFIT) algorithms. To demonstrate some ofthe capabilities of Lightning, we present several examples using a variety ofobservational data. These examples include (1) deriving the spatially resolvedstellar properties of the nearby galaxy M81, (2) demonstrating how X-rayemission can provide constrains on the properties of the supermassive blackhole of a distant AGN, (3) exploring how to rectify the attenuation effects ofinclination on the derived the star formation rate of the edge-on galaxy NGC4631, (4) comparing the performance of Lightning to similar Bayesian SEDfitting codes when deriving physical properties of the star-forming galaxy NGC628, and (5) comparing the derived X-ray and UV-to-IR AGN properties fromLightning and CIGALE for a distant AGN. Lightning is an open-source applicationdeveloped in the Interactive Data Language (IDL) and is available athttps://github.com/rafaeleufrasio/lightning.

  We present pure spectroscopic constraints on the UV luminosity functions andcosmic star formation rate (SFR) densities from 25 galaxies at$z_\mathrm{spec}=8.61-13.20$. By reducing the JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken inmultiple programs of ERO, ERS, GO, and DDT with our analysis technique, weindependently confirm 16 galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}=8.61-11.40$ including newredshift determinations, and a bright interloper at $z_\mathrm{spec}=4.91$ thatwas claimed as a photometric candidate at z~16. In conjunction with ninegalaxies at redshifts up to $z_\mathrm{spec}=13.20$ in the literature, we makea sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in total and carefullyderive the best estimates and lower limits of the UV luminosity functions.These UV luminosity function constraints are consistent with the previousphotometric estimates within the uncertainties and indicate mild redshiftevolution towards z~12 showing tensions with some theoretical models of rapidevolution. With these spectroscopic constraints, we obtain firm lower limits ofthe cosmic SFR densities and spectroscopically confirm a high SFR density atz~12 beyond the constant star-formation efficiency models, which supportsearlier claims from the photometric studies. While there are nospectroscopically-confirmed galaxies with very large stellar masses violatingthe $\Lambda$CDM model due to the removal of the bright interloper, we confirmstar-forming galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}=11-13$ with stellar masses muchhigher than model predictions. Our results indicate possibilities of highstar-formation efficiency (&gt;5%), hidden AGN, top-heavy initial mass function(possibly with Pop-III), and large scatter/variance. Having these successfuland unsuccessful spectroscopy results, we suggest observational strategies forefficiently removing low redshift interlopers for future JWST programs.

  Multiwavelength studies indicate that nuclear activity and bulge propertiesare closely related, but the details remain unclear. To study this further, wecombine $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ bulge structural and photometric propertieswith 1.5 GHz, $e$-MERLIN nuclear radio continuum data from the LeMMINGs surveyfor a large sample of 173 `active' galaxies (LINERs and Seyferts) and`inactive' galaxies (H IIs and absorption line galaxies, ALGs). Dividing oursample into active and inactive, they define distinct (radio coreluminosity)$-$(bulge mass), L_R,core-M_*,bulge, relations, with a mass turnoverat M_*, bulge ~ 10^(9.8 +- 0.3) M_sun (supermassive black hole mass M_BH ~10^(6.8 +- 0.3) M_sun), which marks the transition from AGN-dominated nuclearradio emission in more massive bulges to that mainly driven by stellarprocesses in low-mass bulges. None of our 10/173 bulgeless galaxies host anAGN. The AGN fraction increases with increasing M_*, bulge such thatf_optical_AGN $\propto$ M_*,bulge^(0.24 +- 0.06) and f_radio_AGN $\propto$M_*,bulge^(0.24 +- 0.05). Between M_*,bulge ~ 10^8.5 and 10^11.3 M_sun,f_optical_AGN steadily rises from 15 +- 4 to 80 +- 5 per cent. We find that atfixed bulge mass, the radio loudness, nuclear radio activity and the (opticaland radio) AGN fraction exhibit no dependence on environment. Radio-loud hostspreferentially possess an early-type morphology than radio-quiet hosts, the twotypes are however indistinguishable in terms of bulge S\'ersic index andellipticity, while results on the bulge inner logarithmic profile slope areinconclusive. We finally discuss the importance of bulge mass in determiningthe AGN triggering processes, including potential implications for the nuclearradio emission in nearby galaxies.

  We present analysis of NuSTAR X-ray observations of three AGN that wereidentified as candidate subparsec binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) systemsin the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey based on apparent periodicity intheir optical light curves. Simulations predict that close-separation accretingSMBH binaries will have different X-ray spectra than single accreting SMBHs. Wepreviously observed these AGN with Chandra and found no differences betweentheir low energy X-ray properties and the larger AGN population. However somemodels predict differences to be more prominent at energies higher than probedby Chandra. We find that even at the higher energies probed by NuSTAR, thespectra of these AGN are indistinguishable from the larger AGN population. Thiscould rule out models predicting large differences in the X-ray spectra in theNuSTAR bands. Alternatively, it might mean that these three AGN are not binarySMBHs.

  How does the host galaxy morphology influence a central quasar or vice versa?We address this question by measuring the asymmetries of 2424 SDSS quasar hostsat $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8$ using broad-band ($grizy$) images from the Hyper Suprime-CamSubaru Strategic Program. Control galaxies (without quasars) are selected bymatching the redshifts and stellar masses of the quasar hosts. A two-steppipeline is run to decompose the PSF and \sersic\ components, and then measureasymmetry indices ($A_{\rm CAS}$, $A_{\rm outer}$, and $A_{\rm shape}$) of eachquasar host and control galaxy. We find a mild correlation between hostasymmetry and AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) for the full sample(spearman correlation of 0.37) while a stronger trend is evident at the highestluminosities ($L_{\rm bol}&gt;45$). This then manifests itself into quasar hostsbeing more asymmetric, on average, when they harbor a more massive and highlyaccreting black hole. The merger fraction also positively correlates with$L_{\rm bol}$ and reaches up to 35\% for the most luminous. Compared to controlgalaxies, quasar hosts are marginally more asymmetric (excess of 0.017 inmedian at 9.4$\sigma$ level) and the merger fractions are similar ($\sim16.5\%$). We quantify the dependence of asymmetry on optical band whichdemonstrates that mergers are more likely to be identified with the bluer bandsand the correlation between $L_{\rm bol}$ and asymmetry is also stronger insuch bands. We stress that the band dependence, indicative of a changingstellar population, is an important factor in considering the influence ofmergers on AGN activity.

  We perform X-ray spectral analyses to derive characteristics (e.g., columndensity, X-ray luminosity) of $\approx$10,200 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) inthe XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS), whichwas designed to investigate the growth of supermassive black holes across awide dynamic range of cosmic environments. Using physical torus models (e.g.,Borus02) and a Bayesian approach, we uncover 22 representative Compton-thick(CT; $N_{\rm H} \;&gt;\; 1.5\times10^{24}\; \rm cm^{-2}$) AGN candidates with goodsignal-to-noise ratios as well as a large sample of 136 heavily obscured AGNs.We also find an increasing CT fraction (\fct ) from low ($z&lt;0.75$) to high($z&gt;0.75$) redshift. Our CT candidates tend to show hard X-ray spectral shapesand dust extinction in their SED fits, which may shed light on the connectionbetween AGN obscuration and host-galaxy evolution.

  We investigated dusty and dust-free gas dynamics for a radiation-drivensub-pc scale outflow in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) associated with asupermassive black hole $10^7 M_\odot$ and bolometric luminosity $10^{44}$ ergs$^{-1}$ based on the two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Aradiation-driven ``lotus-like'' multi-shell outflow is launched from the innerpart ($r \lesssim 0.04$ pc) of the geometrically thin disk, and it repeatedlyand steadily produces shocks as mass accretion continues through the disk tothe center. The shape of the dust sublimation radius is not spherical anddepends on the angle ($\theta$) from the disk plane, reflecting thenon-spherical radiation field and non-uniform dust-free gas. Moreover, we foundthat the sublimation radius of $\theta \sim 20$-$60$ deg varies on a timescaleof several years. The ``inflow-induced outflow" contributes the obscuration ofthe nucleus in the sub-pc region. The column density of the dust-free gas is$N_{\rm H} \gtrsim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ for $r \lesssim 0.04$ pc. Gases near thedisk plane ($\theta \lesssim 30$ degree) can be the origin of the Compton-thickcomponent, which was suggested by the recent X-ray observations of AGNs. Thedusty outflow from the sub-pc region can be also a source of material for theradiation-driven fountain for a larger scale.

  A massive naked singularity would be cloaked by accreted matter, and thus mayappear to a distant observer as an opaque \mbox{(quasi-)}spherical surface of afluid, not unlike that of a star or planet. We present here analyticalsolutions for levitating atmospheres around a wide class of sphericallysymmetric naked singularities. Such an atmosphere can be constructed in everyspacetime which possesses a zero-gravity radius and which is a solution of a(modified-)gravity theory possessing the usual conservation laws for matter.Its density peaks at the zero-gravity radius and the atmospheric fluid issupported against infall onto the singularity by gravity alone. In anastrophysical context, an opaque atmosphere would be formed in a very shorttime by accretion of ambient matter onto the singularity -- in a millisecondfor an X-ray binary, in a thousand seconds for a singularity traversinginterstellar space, and a thousand years for a singularity that is the centralengine of an AGN.
