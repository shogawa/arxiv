  The activity of central supermassive black holes might affect the alignment of galaxy spin axes with respect to the closest cosmic filaments. We exploit the SAMI Galaxy Survey to study possible relations between black hole activity and the spin-filament alignments of stars and ionised gas separately. To explore the impact of instantaneous black hole activity, active galaxies are selected according to emission-line diagnostics. Central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_c$) is used as a proxy for black hole mass and its integrated activity. We find evidence for the gas spin-filament alignments to be influenced by AGN, with Seyfert galaxies showing a stronger perpendicular alignment at fixed bulge mass with respect to galaxies where ionisation is consequence of low-ionizaition nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) or old stellar populations (retired galaxies). On the other hand, the greater perpendicular tendency for the stellar spin-filament alignments of high-bulge mass galaxies is dominated by retired galaxies. Stellar alignments show a stronger correlation with $\sigma_c$ compared to the gas alignments. We confirm that bulge mass ($M_{bulge}$) is the primary parameter of correlation for both stellar and gas spin-filament alignments (with no residual dependency left for $\sigma_c$), while $\sigma_c$ is the most important property for secular star formation quenching (with no residual dependency left for $M_{bulge}$). These findings indicate that $M_{bulge}$ and $\sigma_c$ are the most predictive parameters of two different galaxy evolution processes, suggesting mergers trigger spin-filament alignment flips and integrated black hole activity drives star formation quenching.

  We present the rest-frame optical and UV surface brightness (SB) profiles for $149$ galaxies with $M_{\rm opt}&lt; -19.4$ mag at $z=4$-$10$ ($29$ of which are spectroscopically confirmed with JWST NIRSpec), securing high signal-to-noise ratios of $10$-$135$ with deep JWST NIRCam $1$-$5\mu$m images obtained by the CEERS survey. We derive morphologies of our high-$z$ galaxies, carefully evaluating the systematics of SB profile measurements with Monte Carlo simulations as well as the impacts of a) AGNs, b) multiple clumps including galaxy mergers, c) spatial resolution differences with previous HST studies, and d) strong emission lines, e.g., H$\alpha$ and [OIII], on optical morphologies with medium-band F410M images. Conducting S\'ersic profile fitting to our high-$z$ galaxy SBs with GALFIT, we obtain the effective radii of optical $r_{\rm e, opt}$ and UV $r_{\rm e, UV}$ wavelengths ranging $r_{\rm e, opt}=0.05$-$1.6$ kpc and $r_{\rm e, UV}=0.03$-$1.7$ kpc that are consistent with previous results within large scatters in the size luminosity relations. However, we find the effective radius ratio, $r_{\rm e, opt}/r_{\rm e, UV}$, is almost unity, $1.01^{+0.35}_{-0.22}$, over $z=4$-$10$ with no signatures of past inside-out star formation such found at $z\sim 0$-$2$. There are no spatial offsets exceeding $3\sigma$ between the optical and UV morphology centers in case of no mergers, indicative of major star-forming activity only found near a mass center of galaxies at $z\gtrsim 4$ probably experiencing the first phase of inside-out galaxy formation.

  We present a catalog of the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) continuum properties of 98 nearby ($z &lt;$ 0.05) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) selected from the 70-month Swift/BAT hard X-ray catalog that have precisely determined X-ray spectral properties and subarcsec-resolution ALMA Band-6 (211--275 GHz) observations as of 2021 April. Due to the hard-X-ray ($&gt;$ 10 keV) selection, the sample is nearly unbiased for obscured systems at least up to Compton-thick-level obscuration, and provides the largest number of AGNs with high physical resolution mm-wave data ($\lesssim$ 100--200 pc). Our catalog reports emission peak coordinates, spectral indices, and peak fluxes and luminosities at 1.3 mm (230 GHz). Additionally, high-resolution mm-wave images are provided. Using the images and creating radial surface brightness profiles of mm-wave emission, we identify emission extending from the central source and isolated blob-like emission. Flags indicating the presence of these emission features are tabulated. Among 90 AGNs with significant detections of nuclear emission, 37 AGNs ($\approx$ 41%) appear to have both or one of extended or blob-like components. We, in particular, investigate AGNs that show well-resolved mm-wave components and find that these seem to have a variety of origins (i.e., a jet, radio lobes, a secondary AGN, stellar clusters, a narrow line region, galaxy disk, active star-formation regions, and AGN-driven outflows), and some components have currently unclear origins.

  We introduce Monte Carlo-based non-LTE line radiative transfer calculations in the 3D dust radiative transfer code SKIRT, which was originally set up as a dust radiative transfer code. By doing so, we develop a generic and powerful 3D radiative transfer code that can self-consistently generate spectra with molecular and atomic lines against the underlying continuum. We test the accuracy of the non-LTE line radiative transfer module in the extended SKIRT code using standard benchmarks. We find excellent agreement between the SKIRT results, the published benchmark results, and results obtained using the ray-tracing non-LTE line radiative transfer code MAGRITTE, which validates our implementation. We apply the extended SKIRT code on a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of a dusty AGN torus model and generate multi-wavelength images with CO rotational-line spectra against the underlying dust continuum. We find that the low-J CO emission traces the geometrically thick molecular torus, whereas the higher-J CO lines originate from the gas with high kinetic temperature located in the innermost regions of the torus. Comparing the calculations with and without dust radiative transfer, we find that higher-J CO lines are slightly attenuated by the surrounding cold dust when seen edge-on. This shows that atomic and molecular lines can experience attenuation, an effect that is particularly important for transitions at mid- and near-infrared wavelengths. Therefore, our self-consistent dust and non-LTE line radiative transfer calculations can help interpret the observational data from Herschel, ALMA, and JWST.

  About 3-10% of Type I active galactic nuclei (AGN) have double-peaked broad Balmer lines in their optical spectra originating from the motion of gas in their accretion disk. Double-peaked profiles arise not only in AGN, but occasionally appear during optical flares from tidal disruption events and changing-state AGN. In this paper we identify 250 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) amongst a parent sample of optically variable broad-line AGN in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, corresponding to a DPE fraction of 19%. We model spectra of the broad H alpha emission line regions and provide a catalog of the fitted accretion disk properties for the 250 DPEs. Analysis of power spectra derived from the 5 year ZTF light curves finds that DPEs have similar amplitudes and power law indices to other broad-line AGN, but have lower turnover frequencies. Follow-up spectroscopy of 12 DPEs reveals that ~50% display significant changes in the relative strengths of their red and blue peaks over long 10-20 year timescales, indicating that broad-line profile changes arising from spiral arm or hotspot rotation are common amongst optically variable DPEs. Analysis of the accretion disk parameters derived from spectroscopic modeling provides evidence that DPEs are not in a special accretion state, but are simply normal broad-line AGN viewed under the right conditions for the accretion disk to be easily visible. We compare the radio variability properties of the two samples and present radio jet imaging of 3 DPEs with disks of inclination angle 14-35 degrees. We discuss some objects with notable light curves or unusual broad line profiles which are outliers amongst the variable DPE population. We include inspiraling SMBH binary candidate SDSSJ1430+2303 in our analysis, and discuss how its photometric and spectroscopic variability is consistent with the disk-emitting AGN population in ZTF.

  This work studies the relationship between accretion-disk size and quasar properties, using a sample of 95 quasars from the SDSS-RM project with measured lags between the $g$ and $i$ photometric bands. Our sample includes disk lags that are both longer and shorter than predicted by the \citet{SS73} model, requiring explanations which satisfy both cases. Although our quasars each have one lag measurement, we explore the wavelength-dependent effects of diffuse broad line region (BLR) contamination through our sample's broad redshift range, $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2$. We do not find significant evidence of variable diffuse \FeII\ and Balmer nebular emission in the root-mean-square (RMS) spectra, nor from Anderson-Darling tests of quasars in redshift ranges with and without diffuse nebular emission falling in the observed-frame filters. Contrary to previous work, we do not detect a significant correlation between measured continuum and BLR lags in our luminous quasar sample, similarly suggesting that our continuum lags are not dominated by diffuse nebular emission. Similar to other studies, we find that quasars with larger-than-expected continuum lags have lower 3000~\AA\ luminosity, and we additionally find longer continuum lags with lower X-ray luminosity and black hole mass. Our lack of evidence for diffuse BLR contribution to the lags indicates that the anti-correlation between continuum lag and luminosity is not likely to be due to the Baldwin effect. Instead, these anti-correlations favor models in which the continuum lag increases in lower-luminosity AGN, including scenarios featuring magnetic coupling between the accretion disk and X-ray corona, and/or ripples or rims in the disk.   

Complex AGN feedback in the Teacup galaxy. A powerful ionised galactic

  The $z$~0.1 type-2 QSO J1430+1339 (the 'Teacup') is a complex galaxy showing a loop of ionised gas ~10 kpc in diameter, co-spatial radio bubbles, a compact (~1 kpc) jet, and outflow activity. We used VLT/MUSE optical integral field spectroscopic observations to characterise the properties and effects of the galactic ionised outflow from kpc up to tens of kpc scales and compare them with those of the radio jet. We detect a velocity dispersion enhancement (&gt;300 km/s) elongated over several kpc perpendicular to the radio jet, the AGN ionisation lobes, and the fast outflow, similar to what is found in other galaxies hosting compact, low-power jets, indicating that the jet strongly perturbs the host ISM. The mass outflow rate decreases with distance from the nucleus, from around 100 $M_\odot$/yr in the inner 1-2 kpc to &lt;0.1 $M_\odot$/yr at 30 kpc. The ionised mass outflow rate is ~1-8 times higher than the molecular one, in contrast with what is often quoted in AGN. The driver of the multi-phase outflow is likely a combination of AGN radiation and the jet. The outflow mass-loading factor (~5-10) and the molecular gas depletion time (&lt;10$^8$ yr) indicate that the outflow can significantly affect the star formation and the gas reservoir in the galaxy. However, the fraction of the ionised outflow that is able to escape the dark matter halo potential is likely negligible. We detect blue-coloured continuum emission co-spatial with the ionised gas loop. Here, stellar populations are younger (&lt;100-150 Myr) than in the rest of the galaxy (~0.5-1 Gyr). This constitutes possible evidence for star formation triggered at the edge of the bubble due to the compressing action of the jet and outflow ('positive feedback'), as predicted by theory. All in all, the Teacup constitutes a rich system in which AGN feedback from outflows and jets, in both its negative and positive flavours, co-exist.

  Over the past decade, the existence of a substantial population of optically invisible, massive galaxies at $z\gtrsim3$ has been implied from mid-infrared to millimeter observations. With the unprecedented sensitivity of the JWST, such extremely massive galaxy candidates have immediately been identified even at $z&gt;7$, in much larger numbers than expected. These discoveries raised a hot debate. If confirmed, early, high-mass galaxies challenge the current models of galaxy formation. However, the lack of spectroscopic confirmations leads to uncertain stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) estimates, and the possible presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) adds further uncertainty. Here, we present the first sample of 36 dust-obscured galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts at $z_{\rm spec}=5-9$ from the JWST FRESCO survey. The three most extreme sources at $z\sim5-6$ ($\sim$1 billion years after the Big Bang) are so massive (log$M_{\star}/M_{\odot}$ $\gtrsim11.0$) that they would require, on average, about 50% of the baryons in their halos to be converted into stars -- two to three times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later times. The extended emission of these galaxies suggests limited contribution by AGN. This population of ultra-massive galaxies accounts for 20% of the total cosmic star formation rate density at $z\sim5-6$, suggesting a substantial proportion of extremely efficient star formation in the early Universe.
