  We investigate UV continuum slopes $\beta$ of 974 galaxies at $z=4-14$ using archival JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectra obtained from major JWST GTO, ERS, and GO programs, including JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER. Among these galaxies, we identify a remarkable galaxy at $z=9.25$, dubbed EBG-1, with a significantly blue UV slope $\beta=-2.99\pm0.15$, unlike the rest of the galaxies that exhibit red continua or ambiguous blue continua hindered by large uncertainties. We confirm that the $\beta$ value negligibly changes by the data reduction and fitting wavelength ranges for UV emission/absorption line masking. The extreme blue slope, $\beta=-3.0$, rules out significant contributions from dust extinction or AGN activity. Comparing with stellar and nebular emission models, we find that such a blue UV slope cannot be reproduced solely by stellar models even with very young, metal-poor, or top-heavy contiguous star formation associated with strong nebular continua making the UV slopes red, but with a high ionizing photon escape fraction, $f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{ion} \gtrsim 0.5$, for a weak nebular continuum. While the H$\beta$ emission line is not detected, likely due to the limited sensitivity of the spectrum, we find moderately weak [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines for the given star-formation rate ($3\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and stellar mass ($10^{8.0} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) that are about three times weaker than the average emission lines, again suggestive of the high ionizing photon escape fraction, $f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{ion} \sim 0.7$ or more. EBG-1 would provide crucial insights into stellar and nebular continuum emission in high-redshift galaxies, serving as an example of the ionizing photon escaping site at the epoch of reionization.

  To investigate the radio properties of the recently found high-redshift population, we collected a sample of $919$ little red dots (LRDs) from the literature. By cross-matching their coordinates with the radio catalogues based on the first- and second-epoch observations of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey, we found no radio counterparts coinciding with any of the LRDs. To uncover possible sub-mJy level weak radio emission, we performed mean and median image stacking analyses of empty-field 'Quick Look' VLASS and FIRST image cutouts centred on the LRD positions. We found no radio emission above $3\sigma$ noise levels ($\sim11$ and $\sim18~\mu$Jy~beam$^{-1}$ for the VLASS and FIRST maps, respectively) in either of the stacked images for the LRD sample, while the noise levels of the single-epoch images are comparable to those found earlier in the stacking of high-redshift radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The non-detection of radio emission in LRDs suggests these sources host weaker (or no) radio AGNs.

  Some Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host outflows which have the potential to alter the host galaxy's evolution (AGN feedback). These outflows have been linked to enhanced radio emission. Here we investigate the connection between low-frequency radio emission using the International LOFAR Telescope and [O III] $\lambda$5007 ionised gas outflows using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Deep Fields, we select 198 AGN with optical spectra, 115 of which are detected at 144 MHz, and investigate their low-frequency radio emission properties. The majority of our sample do not show a radio excess when considering radio luminosity - SFR relationship, and are therefore not driven by powerful jets. We extract the [O III] $\lambda$5007 kinematics and remove AGN luminosity dependencies by matching the radio detected and non-detected AGN in $L_{\mathrm{6\mu m}}$ and redshift. Using both spectral fitting and $W_{80}$ measurements, we find radio detected AGN have a higher outflow rate (67.2$\pm$3.4 percent) than the radio non-detected AGN (44.6$\pm$2.7 percent), indicating a connection between ionised outflows and the presence of radio emission. For spectra where there are two components of the [O III] emission line present, we normalise all spectra by the narrow component and find that the average broad component in radio detected AGN is enhanced compared to the radio non-detected AGN. This could be a sign of higher gas content, which is suggestive of a spatial relationship between [O III] outflows and radio emission in the form of either low-powered jets or shocks from AGN winds.

  Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs), characterized by emerging or disappearing of broad lines accompanied with extreme continuum flux variability, have drawn much attention for their potential of revealing physical processes underlying AGN evolution. We perform seven-season spectroscopic monitoring on Mrk~1018, one of the earliest identified CL-AGN. Around 2020, we detect a full-cycle changing-look transition of Mrk~1018 within one year, associated with a nucleus outburst, which likely arise from the disk instability in the transition region between the outer standard rotation-dominated disk and inner advection-dominated accretion flow. Over the past forty-five years, the accretion rate of Mrk~1018 changed 1000 times and the maximum Eddington ratio reached 0.02. By investigating the relation between broad-line properties and Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$), we find strong evidence that the full-cycle type transition is regulated by accretion. There exists a turnover point in the Balmer decrement, which is observed for the first time. The broad Balmer lines change from a single peak in Type 1.0-1.2 to double peaks in Type 1.5-1.8 and the double-peak separation decreases with increasing accretion rate. We also find that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the broad Balmer lines obeys FWHM$\propto (L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd})^{-0.27}$, as expected for a virialized BLR. The velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm line}$ follows a similar trend in Type 1.5-1.8, but displays a sharp increases in Type 1.0-1.2, resulting in a dramatic drop of FWHM/$\sigma_{\rm line}$. These findings suggest that a virialized BLR together with accretion-dependent turbulent motions might be responsible for the diversity of BLR phenomena across AGN population.

  Infrared-faint radio sources (IFRSs) are believed to be a rare class of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RL AGN) characterized by their high radio-to-infrared flux density ratios of up to several thousands. Previous studies have shown that a fraction of IFRSs are likely to be hosted in dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs). In this paper, our aim was to probe the dust properties, star formation rate (SFR), and AGN activity of IFRSs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of 20 IFRSs with spectroscopic redshifts ranging from 1.2 to 3.7. We compare the Bayesian evidence of a three-component model (stellar, AGN and cold dust) with that of a two-component model (stellar and cold dust) for six IFRSs in our sample with far-infrared (FIR) photometry and find that the three-component model has significantly higher Bayesian evidence, suggesting that IFRSs are most likely to be AGN. The median SED of our IFRS sample shows similarities to AGN-starburst composite in the IR regime. The derived IR luminosities of IFRSs indicate that they are low-luminosity counterparts of high-redshift radio galaxies. We disentangle the contributions of AGN-heated and star-formation-heated dust to the IR luminosity of IFRSs and find that our sample is likely AGN-dominated. However, despite the evidence for significant impact of AGN on the host galaxy, the AGN luminosity of our sample does not show correlation with the SFR of the sources.

  We present a 19.7 - 214 $\mu$m imaging atlas of local (4 - 181 Mpc; median 43 Mpc) active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed with FORCAST and HAWC+ on board the SOFIA telescope with angular resolutions ~ 3"- 20". This atlas comprises 22 Seyferts (17 Type 2 and 5 Type 1) with a total of 69 images, 41 of which have not been previously published. The AGN span a range of luminosities of log$_{10}$ ($L_{bol}$ [erg/s]) = [42, 46] with a median of log$_{10}$ ($L_{bol}$ [erg/s]) = 44.1 $\pm$ 1.0. We provide total fluxes of our sample using aperture photometry for point source objects and a 2-D Gaussian fitting for objects with extended host galaxy emission, which was used to estimate the unresolved nuclear component. Most galaxies in our sample are point-like sources, however, four sources (Centaurus A, Circinus, NGC 1068, and NGC 4388) show extended emission in all wavelengths. The 30 - 40 $\mu$m extended emission in NGC 4388 is coincident with the narrow line region at PA ~ 50$^{\circ}$, while the dusty extension at longer wavelengths arises from the host galaxy at PA ~ 90$^{\circ}$. Our new observations allow us to construct the best sampled spectral energy distributions (SEDs) available between 30 - 500 $\mu$m for a sample of nearby AGN. We estimate that the average peak wavelength of the nuclear SEDs is ~ 40 $\mu$m in $\nu$F$_{\nu}$ , which we associate with an unresolved extended dusty region heated by the AGN.

  Spectrum analysis at 3 mm of the central region ($r\sim$800 pc) of NGC\,4303 showed molecular gas lines of both dense gas tracers (HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, and C$_2$H) and diffuse gases ($^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O). Molecular gas derived parameters: $H_2$ mass $M_{H_2}$=(1.75$\pm$0.32)$\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$; radial velocity, V$_{dense}=$178$\pm$60 km\,s$^{-1}$, and V$_{CO}=$151$\pm$29 km\,s$^{-1}$; HCN luminosity $L_{HCN}$=(7.38$\pm$1.40)$\times10^{6}\,\,K\,\,km\,\,s^{-1}\,pc^{2}$; dense gas mass $M_{dense}$=(4.7$\pm$0.3) $\times 10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$, and dense gas tracers abundances indicating that dense gas contributes significantly to the total molecular gas mass. To explore the AGN nature and central dusty torus of the galaxy, CIGALE was used to fit the integrated spectral energy distribution from submillimeter to UV frequencies. Large torus properties are estimated: luminosity $L_{TORUS}$\,=\,(7.1$\pm$2.8) $\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and line of sight inclination of 67$\pm$16$^\circ$, which is consistent with a Type 2 AGN; total infrared luminosity $L_{IR}$=(3.51$\,\pm$\,0.30)$\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$; star formation rate $SFR$=6.0$\pm$0.3 M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$; and found that the AGN contribution is marginal at $\sim$20\%.   

No evidence for fast, galaxy-wide ionised outflows in a nearby quasar --
  the importance of accounting for beam smearing

  To test the scenario that outflows accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a major impact on galaxy-wide scales, we have analysed deep VLT/MUSE data for the type-2 quasar/ultraluminous infrared galaxy F13451+1232 - an object that represents the major mergers considered in models of galaxy evolution. After carefully accounting for the effects of atmospheric seeing that had smeared the emission from known compact nuclear outflows across the MUSE field of view, we find that the large-scale kinematics in F13451+1232 are consistent with gravitational motions that are expected in a galaxy merger. Therefore, the fast ($\mathrm{W_{80}}&gt;500$ km s$^{-1}$) warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows in this object are limited to the central $\sim$100 pc of the galaxy, although we cannot rule out larger-scale, lower-velocity outflows. Moreover, we directly demonstrate that failure to account for the beam-smearing effects of atmospheric seeing would have led to the mass outflow rates and kinetic powers of spatially-extended emission being overestimated by orders of magnitude. We also show that beam-smeared compact-outflow emission can be significant beyond radial distances of 3.5 arcseconds (more than eight times the radius of the seeing disk), and support the argument that some previous claims of large-scale outflows in active galaxies were likely the result of this effect rather than genuine galaxy-wide ($r&gt;5$ kpc) outflows. Our study therefore provides further evidence that warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows are limited to the central kiloparsecs of galaxies and highlights the critical importance of accounting for atmospheric seeing in ground-based observational studies of active galaxies.

  This study examines the average X-ray properties of massive halos at z&lt; 0.2, covering the largest halo mass range to date, from Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters. The analysis is based on stacking in the eFEDS area of the GAMA galaxy group sample, validated with synthetic data that mimic observed eROSITA X-ray and GAMA optical data using Magneticum lightcones. Stacking was conducted in halo mass bins and tested for AGN and X-ray binary contamination, systematics in the halo mass proxy, and uncertainties in optical group centers. The study provides average X-ray surface brightness profiles in six mass bins, spanning Milky Way-like systems to poor clusters. The scatter in the X-ray luminosity-mass (LX-M) relation is attributed to gas concentration: low X-ray luminosity systems at fixed halo mass exhibit lower central gas concentrations than high-luminosity systems, consistent with Magneticum predictions. However, discrepancies in dark matter concentration arise, with Magneticum predicting undetected groups as older and more relaxed, while observations suggest the opposite. New LX-M relations are presented covering three decades of halo mass. These relations fit a single power law, aligning with previous studies. Magneticum matches observed gas distributions across all masses, whereas IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, Simba, and FLAMINGO exhibit significant discrepancies at various mass scales. Simulations calibrated on local galaxy properties accurately reproduce central galaxies but fail to capture gas properties. Conversely, simulations like Magneticum excel in gas predictions but produce overly massive central galaxies. Further exploration of gas and dark matter distributions and their effects on galaxy properties is critical to comprehending the role of gravitational forces and feedback in shaping large-scale structure and galaxy evolution.

  Hydrodynamical simulation predictions are often compared with observational data without fully accounting for systematics and biases specific to observational techniques. Using the magnetohydrodynamical simulation Magneticum, we generate mock eROSITA eRASS:4 data, combined with GAMA-like spectroscopic surveys and optically selected galaxy catalogs from the same light-cone, to analyze hot gas properties in galaxy groups via a stacking technique. This study aims to (i) incorporate observational systematics into predictions and (ii) evaluate the reliability of stacking techniques for determining average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. Our analysis provides X-ray emission predictions from Magneticum, including contributions from AGN, X-ray binaries (XRBs), and the Intra-Group Medium (IGM) as a function of halo mass, covering Milky Way (MW)-like groups to poor clusters. We find that AGN and XRBs dominate the X-ray surface brightness profiles of low-mass halos. The reliability of stacking techniques is tested by reproducing input X-ray surface brightness and electron density profiles, accounting for completeness and contamination of prior samples, miscentering of optical group centers, uncertainties in X-ray emissivity due to gas temperature and metallicity assumption, and systematics in halo mass proxies. The halo mass proxy emerges as the primary source of systematics, affecting X-ray surface brightness and scaling relations. We show that stacked X-ray luminosity-mass relations are flatter than input relations but consistent with observations. Additionally, the retrieved hot gas fraction-mass relation aligns well with observational data. These results highlight the need to account for systematic errors when comparing stacking techniques to other methods using different prior catalogs or predictions.
