  We report the results of 3D spectroscopic observations of Mrk 493 (NLS1galaxy) with the integral-field spectrograph MPFS of the SAO RAS 6-m telescope.The difference in the slope of the optical continuum emission intensity acrossthe nucleus part and an extensive continuum emission region} is detected. Theemission in lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [OIII], etc.) coincides with acomposite nuclear region: an AGN plus a circum-nuclear star-forming ringobserved in the HST UV/optical images. The [SII] emission region tends to be upto 1kpc around the center. The H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ could be decomposed intothree components (broad $\sim$ 2000 km/s. intermediate $\sim$ 700 km/s andnarrow $\sim$ 250 km/s). We found that width ($\sim$ 750 km/s) of the Fe IIlines correspond to the intermediate component, that may indicate a non-BLRorigin of the Fe II lines, or that a large fraction of the Fe II emission arisein the outher parts of the BLR. The weak broad component detected in theH$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and He$\lambda$4686 may come from the unresolved centralBLR, but also partly produced by violent starburst in the circum-nuclear ring.Moreover, diagnostic diagrams clearly show presence of the HII regions (not aSy 1 nucleus) in the NLR of Mrk 493.

  Results of high-resolution simultaneous multi-frequency 8.1-15.4 GHz VLBApolarimetric observations of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (theMOJAVE-2 project) are analyzed. We compare characteristics of VLBI featureswith jet model predictions and test if adiabatic expansion is a dominatingmechanism for the evolution of relativistic shocks in parsec-scale AGN jets. Wealso discuss magnetic field configuration, both predicted by the model anddeduced from electric vector position angle measurements.  
Testing the predictions of the cold dark matter model for the sizes,

  The huge size and uniformity of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey makes possiblean exacting test of current models of galaxy formation. We compare thepredictions of the GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model for theluminosities, morphologies, colours and scale-lengths of local galaxies.GALFORM models the luminosity and size of the disk and bulge components of agalaxy, and so we can compute quantities which can be compared directly withSDSS observations, such as the Petrosian magnitude and the Sersic index. Wetest the predictions of two published models set in the cold dark mattercosmology: the Baugh et al. (2005) model, which assumes a top-heavy initialmass function (IMF) in starbursts and superwind feedback, and the Bower et al.(2006) model, which uses AGN feedback and a standard IMF. The Bower et al modelbetter reproduces the overall shape of the luminosity function, themorphology-luminosity relation and the colour bimodality observed in the SDSSdata, but gives a poor match to the size-luminosity relation. The \Baugh et al.model successfully predicts the size-luminosity relation for late-typegalaxies. Both models fail to reproduce the sizes of bright early-typegalaxies. These problems highlight the need to understand better both the roleof feedback processes in determining galaxy sizes, in particular the treatmentof the angular momentum of gas reheated by supernovae, and the sizes of thestellar spheroids formed by galaxy mergers and disk instabilities.  
Towards millimeter VLBI

  We discuss the present performance and the future perspectives of VLBI in the3 mm to 0.85 mm observing bands (so called mm-VLBI). The availability of newtelescopes and the recent technical development towards larger observingbandwidth and higher data-rates now allow to image with 3mm-VLBI hundreds ofsources with high dynamic range. As an example we show new images of the jetsof Cygnus A. At 1.3 mm, pilot VLBI studies have proven detectability of thebrightest AGN, and the existence of ultra-compact regions therein. In the nextfew years global VLBI imaging will be established also at 1.3 mm and 0.85 mmwavelength. With an angular resolution in the 10-20 micro-arcsecond range,future 1.3 mm- and 0.8 mm VLBI will be an extraordinarily powerful astronomicalobserving method, allowing to image the enigmatic `central engines' and thefoot-points of AGN-jets in greater detail than ever possible before. Asufficiently large number of telescopes is a prerequisite for global aperturesynthesis imaging. Therefore a strong effort is needed to make more telescopesavailable for VLBI at short millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. In thiscontext, the further VLBI upgrade of both IRAM telescopes and the outfit of theAPEX telescope in Chile, in preparation for later mm-/sub-mm VLBI with ALMA, isof high scientific importance. With a sufficiently large mm-VLBI network, themicro-arcsecond scale imaging of the post-Newtonian emission zone around theevent horizon/ergosphere of nearby super-massive Black Holes (such as e.g. SgrA*, M87, ...) should become possible within the next few years.

  We study the prospects of finding the first quasars in the universe with ALMAand JWST. For this purpose, we derive a model for the high-redshift black holepopulation based on observed relations between the black hole mass and the hostgalaxy. We re-address previous constraints from the X-ray background withparticular focus on black hole luminosities below the Eddington limit asobserved in many local AGN. For such luminosities, up to 20% of high-redshiftblack holes can be active quasars. We then discuss the observables ofhigh-redshift black holes for ALMA and JWST by adopting NGC 1068 as a referencesystem. We calculate the expected flux of different fine-structure lines for asimilar system at higher redshift, and provide further predictions for high-JCO lines. We discuss the expected fluxes from stellar light, the AGN continuumand the Lyman $\alpha$ line for JWST. Line fluxes observed with ALMA can beused to derive detailed properties of high-redshift sources. We suggest twoobservational strategies to find potential AGN at high redshift and estimatethe expected number of sources, which is between 1-10 for ALMA with a field ofview of $\sim(1')^2$ searching for line emission and 100-1000 for JWST with afield of view of $(2.16')^2$ searching for continuum radiation. We find thatboth telescopes can probe high-redshift quasars down to redshift 10 and beyond,and therefore truely detect the first quasars in the universe.  
MOJAVE: Monitoring of Jets in AGN with VLBA Experiments. V. Multi-epoch
  VLBA Images

  We present images from a long term program (MOJAVE: Monitoring of Jets in AGNwith VLBA Experiments) to survey the structure and evolution of parsec-scalejet phenomena associated with bright radio-loud active galaxies in the northernsky. The observations consist of 2424 15 GHz VLBA images of a completeflux-density limited sample of 135 AGN above declination -20 degrees, spanningthe period 1994 August to 2007 September. These data were acquired as part ofthe MOJAVE and 2 cm Survey programs, and from the VLBA archive. The sampleselection criteria are based on multi-epoch parsec-scale (VLBA) flux density,and heavily favor highly variable and compact blazars. The sample includesnearly all the most prominent blazars in the northern sky, and is well-suitedfor statistical analysis and comparison with studies at other wavelengths. Ourmulti-epoch and stacked-epoch images show 94% of the sample to have apparentone-sided jet morphologies, most likely due to the effects of relativisticbeaming. Of the remaining sources, five have two-sided parsec-scale jets, andthree are effectively unresolved by the VLBA at 15 GHz, with essentially all ofthe flux density contained within a few tenths of a milliarcsecond.  
Mass Loss by X-ray Winds from Active Galactic Nuclei  
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.3621v1  
Published: 2008-12-18T18:45:12Z  
  We consider a sample of type-I active galactic nuclei (AGN) that wereobserved by Chandra/HETG and resulted in high signal-to-noise grating spectra,which we study in detail. All objects show signatures for very high ionizationoutflows. Using a novel scheme to model the physics and spectral signatures ofgaseous winds from these objects, we are able to estimate the mass loss ratesand kinetic luminosities associated with the highly ionized gas and investigateits physical properties. Our conclusions are as follows: 1) There is a strongindication that the outflowing gas in those objects is multi-phase with similarkinematics for the different phases. 2) The X-ray spectrum is consistent withsuch flows being thermally driven from ~pc scales, and are therefore unlikelyto be associated with the inner accretion disk. 3) The underlying X-rayspectrum consists of a hard X-ray powerlaw which is similar for all objectsshining below their Eddington rate and a soft excess whose contribution becomesmore prominent for objects shining close to their Eddington limit. 4) Thephysical properties of the outflow are similar in all cases and a coherentpicture emerges concerning its physical properties. 5) The deduced mass lossrates are, roughly, of the order of the mass accretion rate in those objects sothat the kinetic luminosity carried by such winds is only a tiny fraction(&lt;&lt;1%) of the bolometric luminosity. We discuss the implications of our resultsfor AGN structure and AGN interaction with the environment.

  The impact of environment on AGN activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizinga mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zCOSMOSspectroscopic redshift survey. We identify 147 AGN by their X-ray emission asdetected by XMM-Newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. We measure thefraction of galaxies with stellar mass M_*&gt;2.5x10^10 Msun that host an AGN as afunction of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighborsthat cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 Mpc). Overall, we find that AGNsprefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies withsubstantial levels of star formation. Specifically, AGNs with host massesbetween 0.25-1x10^11 Msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color orspecific star formation rate. Host galaxies having M_*&gt;10^11 Msun clearlyillustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantlybluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lowerdensity regions analogous to SDSS studies of narrow-line AGN. To probe theenvironment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies(M_*&gt;2.5x10^10 Msun) hosting AGNs inside optically-selected groups, and find nosignificant difference with field galaxies. We interpret our results asevidence that AGN activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probabilityof a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidenceby its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptiveprocesses (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.  
Evolution in the properties of Lyman-alpha emitters from redshifts z ~ 3
  to z ~ 2  
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.3152v2  
Published: 2008-12-17T17:44:26Z  
  Context: Narrow-band surveys for Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) is a powerful toolin detecting high, and very high, redshift galaxies. Even though samples aregrowing at redshifts z = 3 - 6, the nature of these galaxies is still poorlyknown. Aims: To study the properties of z = 2.25 LAEs and compare those withthe properties of z &gt; 3 LAEs. Methods: We present narrow-band imaging made withthe MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope with the WFI detector. We have made a selection foremission-line objects and find 170 candidate typical LAEs and 17 candidateswhich we regard as high UV-transmission LAEs. We have derived the magnitudes ofthese objects in 8 bands from u* to Ks, and studied if they have X-ray and/orradio counterparts. Results: We show that there has been significant evolutionin the properties of LAEs between redshift z ~ 3 and z = 2.25. The spread inspectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the lower redshift is larger and wedetect a significant AGN contribution in the sample. The distribution of theequivalent widths is narrower than at z ~ 3, with only a few candidates withrest-frame equivalent width above the predicted limit of 240 A. The starformation rates derived from the Ly-alpha emission compared to that derivedfrom the UV emission are lower by on average a factor of ~ 1.8, indicating alarge absorption of dust. Conclusion: LAEs at redshift z = 2.25 may be moreevolved than LAEs at higher redshift. The red SEDs imply more massive, olderand/or more dusty galaxies at lower redshift than observed at higher redshifts.The decrease in equivalent widths and star formation rates indicate morequiescent galaxies, with in general less star formation than in higher redshiftgalaxies. At z = 2.25, AGN appear to be more abundant and also to contributemore to the LAE population. [Abridged]
