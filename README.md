  We assemble a sample of 733 dwarf galaxies ($M_{\ast} \le 10^{9.5} \text{M}_\odot$) with signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and explore the intersection between different AGN selection techniques. Objects in our database are compiled from previous studies that identify AGN in dwarf galaxies through spectroscopy, X-ray emission, infrared colors, and optical photometric variability. We apply a uniform set of AGN diagnostic tools to the database using archival data. We find that any single selection method captures no more than half of the overall AGN population, and there is a general disagreement amongst the AGN selection methods in this stellar mass regime. The largest overlap between methods is found when both methods use optical spectroscopic data. In contrast, the populations of AGN intersect the least when comparing those methods that use photometric data at different wavelengths. These results can be used to better constrain the active fraction in dwarf galaxies, which is in turn an important constraint for black hole seed formation models. In a follow-up paper, we will explore links between the effectiveness of each selection technique and host galaxy properties.

  We have characterized the ionized, neutral, and warm molecular gas kinematics in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3227 using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, Gemini-North's Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. We fit multiple Gaussians to several spatially-resolved emission lines observed with long-slit and integral-field spectroscopy and isolate the kinematics based on apparent rotational and outflowing motions. We use the kinematics to determine an orientation for the bicone along which the outflows travel, and find that the biconical structure has an inclination of $40 ^{+5}_{-4}${\deg} from our line of sight, and a half-opening angle with an inner and outer boundary of $47 ^{+6}_{-2}${\deg} and $68 ^{+1}_{-1}${\deg}, respectively. We observe ionized outflows traveling 500 km s$^{-1}$ at distances up to 7$''$ (800 pc) from the SMBH, and disturbed ionized gas up to a distance of 15$''$ (1.7 kpc). Our analysis reveals that the ionized outflows are launched from within 20 pc of the SMBH, at the same location as a bridge of cold gas across the nucleus detected in ALMA CO(2-1) observations. We measure a turnover radius where the gas starts decelerating at a distance of $26 \pm 6$ pc from the AGN. Compared to a turnover radius in the range of $31- 63$ pc from a radiative driving model, we confirm that radiative driving is the dominant acceleration mechanism for the narrow line region (NLR) outflows in NGC 3227.

  We present Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) spectroscopic observations of 95 galaxies from the Arp &amp; Madore (1987) catalogue of peculiar galaxies. These galaxies have been selected because they appear to be in pairs and small groups. These observations have allowed us to confirm that 60 galaxies are indeed interacting systems. For the confirmed interacting sample, we have built a matched control sample of isolated galaxies. We present an analysis of the stellar populations and nuclear activity in the interacting galaxies and compare them with the isolated galaxies. We find a median light (mass) fraction of 55% (10%) in the interacting galaxies coming from stellar populations younger than 2 Gyr and 28% (3%) in the case of the isolated galaxies. More than half of the interacting galaxies are dominated by this young stellar population, while the isolated ones have most of their light coming from older stellar populations. We used a combination of diagnostic diagrams (BPTs and WHAN) to classify the main ionization mechanisms of the gas. The interacting galaxies in our sample consistently show a higher fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) relative to the control sample, which ranges between 1.6 and 4 depending on the combination of diagnostic diagrams employed to classify the galaxies and the number of galaxies considered. Our study provides further observational evidence that interactions drive star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies and can have a significant impact on galaxy evolution.

  Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) hosting extended photoionized nebulae provide us with a unique view of the timescales associated with AGN activity. Here, we present a new Green Bean galaxy (RGB1) at $z=0.304458\pm0.000007$ with large scale jet-induced radio emission. The Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of the radio components show steep spectral indices ($\alpha=-0.85$ to $-0.92$ for the extended regions, and $\alpha=-1.02$ for the faint radio core), and spectral age modeling of the extended radio emission indicates that the lobes are $&gt;$6 Myrs old. It is unclear whether the jet is active, or remnant with an off-time of 2-3 Myr. Several detached clouds lie around the host galaxy up to 37.8 kpc away from the nucleus, and their ionization profile indicates a decline ($\sim$2 dex) in the AGN ionizing photon production over the past $\sim$0.15 Myr. Furthermore, we measure a blue shift for one of the clouds that is spatially coincident with the path of the radio jet. The cloud is likely illuminated by the photoionizing AGN, and potentially underwent an interaction with the relativistic jet. Our multiwavelength analysis suggests that RGB1 was in a phase of jet production prior to the radiatively efficient accretion phase traced by the detached cloud emission. It is unclear whether RGB1 transitioned into a low-excitation radio galaxy or an inactive galaxy over the past $\sim$0.15 Myr, or whether the extended radio and optical emission trace distinct accretion phases that occurred in succession.

  Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found in the centers of massive galaxies, and galaxy mergers should eventually lead to SMBH mergers. Quasar activity has long been associated with galaxy mergers, so here we investigate if supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are preferentially found in quasars. Our multimessenger investigation folds together a gravitational wave background signal from NANOGrav, a sample of periodic AGN candidates from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, and a quasar mass function, to estimate an upper limit on the fraction of quasars which could host a SMBHB. We find at 95\% confidence that quasars are at most seven times as likely to host a SMBHB as a random galaxy. Quasars should therefore be prioritized as targets for SMBHB searches in pulsar timing arrays.

  JWST is discovering increasing numbers of quiescent galaxies 1--2 billion years after the Big Bang, whose redshift, high mass, and old stellar ages indicate that their formation and quenching were surprisingly rapid. This fast-paced evolution seems to require that feedback from AGN (active galactic nuclei) be faster and/or more efficient than previously expected \citep{Xie24}. We present deep ALMA observations of cold molecular gas (the fuel for star formation) in a massive, fast-rotating, post-starburst galaxy at $z=3.064$. This galaxy hosts an AGN, driving neutral-gas outflows with a mass-outflow rate of $60\pm20$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and has a star-formation rate of $&lt;5.6$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our data reveal this system to be the most distant gas-poor galaxy confirmed with direct CO observations (molecular-gas mass $&lt; 10^{9.1}$ M$_{\odot}$; &lt;0.8 % of its stellar mass). Combining ALMA and JWST observations, we estimate the gas-consumption history of this galaxy, showing that it evolved with net zero gas inflow, i.e., gas consumption by star formation matches the amount of gas this galaxy is missing relative to star-forming galaxies. This could arise both from preventive feedback stopping further gas inflow, which would otherwise refuel star formation or, alternatively, from fine-tuned ejective feedback matching precisely gas inflows. Our methods, applied to a larger sample, promise to disentangle ejective vs preventive feedback.
