  We present the first results from Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations as a part of the Fundamental Reference Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) Monitoring Experiment (FRAMEx), a program to understand the relationship between AGN accretion physics and wavelength-dependent position as a function of time. With this VLA survey, we investigate the radio properties from a volume-complete sample of 25 hard X-ray-selected AGNs using the VLA in its wideband mode. We observed the targets in the A-array configuration at $4-12$ GHz with all polarization products. In this work, we introduce our calibration and imaging methods for this survey, and we present our results and analysis for the radio quiet AGN NGC 4388. We calibrated and imaged these data using the multi-term, multi-frequency synthesis imaging algorithm to determine its spatial, spectral and polarization structure across a continuous $4-12$ GHz band. In the AGN, we measure a broken power law spectrum with $\alpha=-0.06$ below a break frequency of 7.3 GHz and $\alpha=-0.34$ above. We detect polarization at sub-arcsecond resolution across both the AGN and a secondary radio knot. We compare our results to ancillary data and find that the VLA radio continuum is likely due to AGN winds interacting with the local interstellar medium that gets resolved away at sub-parsec spatial scales as probed by the Very Long Baseline Array. A well-known ionization cone to the southwest of the AGN appears likely to be projected material onto the underside of the disk of the host galaxy.

  We present the identification of 42 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (type-2 AGN) candidates in the two deepest observations of the JADES spectroscopic survey with JWST/NIRSpec. The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allow us to select narrow-line AGNs based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z=10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at $z&gt;3$ the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation. Therefore, we also use high ionisation lines, such as HeII$\lambda$4686, HeII$\lambda$1640, NeIV$\lambda$2422, NeV$\lambda$3420, and NV$\lambda$1240, also in combination with other UV transitions, to trace the presence of AGN. Out of a parent sample of 209 galaxies, we identify 42 type-2 AGN (although 10 of them are tentative), giving a fraction of galaxies in JADES hosting type-2 AGN of about $20\pm3$\%, which does not evolve significantly in the redshift range between 2 and 10. The selected type-2 AGN have estimated bolometric luminosities of $10^{41.3-44.9}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and host-galaxy stellar masses of $10^{7.2-9.3}$ M$_{\odot}$. The star formation rates of the selected AGN host galaxies are consistent with those of the star-forming main sequence. The AGN host galaxies at z=4-6 contribute $\sim$8-30 \% to the UV luminosity function, slightly increasing with UV luminosity.

  Hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are unique among formation channels of binary black holes (BBHs) because they are likely associated with electromagnetic counterparts and can efficiently lead to the mass growth of BHs. Here, we explore the impact of gas accretion and migration traps on the evolution of BBHs in AGNs. We have developed a new fast semi-analytic model, which allows us to explore the parameter space while capturing the main physical processes involved. We find that effective exchange of energy and angular momentum between the BBH and the surrounding gas (hereafter, gas hardening) during inspiral greatly enhances the efficiency of hierarchical mergers, leading to the formation of intermediate-mass BHs (up to 10.000 solar masses) and triggering spin alignment. Moreover, our models with efficient gas hardening show both an anti-correlation between BBH mass ratio and effective spin, and a correlation between primary BH mass and effective spin. In contrast, if gas hardening is inefficient, the hierarchical merger chain is already truncated after the first two or three generations. We compare the BBH population in AGNs with other dynamical channels as well as isolated binary evolution.

  The X-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to come from a combination of inverse Compton scattering of photons from the accretion disk and reprocessing of the direct X-ray emission by reflection. We present hard (10-80 keV) and soft (0.5-8 keV) X-ray monitoring of a gravitationally lensed quasar RX J1131-1231 with NuSTAR, Swift, and XMM-Newton between 10 June 2016 and 30 November 2020. Comparing the amplitude of quasar microlensing variability at the hard and soft bands allows a size comparison, where larger sources lead to smaller microlensing variability. During the period between 6 June 2018 and 30 November 2020, where both the hard and soft light curves are available, the hard and soft bands varied by factors of 3.7 and 5.5, respectively, with rms variability of $0.40\pm0.05$ and $0.57\pm0.02$. Both the variability amplitude and rms are moderately smaller for the hard X-ray emission, indicating that the hard X-ray emission is moderately larger than the soft X-ray emission region. We found the reflection fraction from seven joint hard and soft X-ray monitoring epochs is effectively consistent with a constant with low significance variability. After decomposing the total X-ray flux into direct and reprocessed components, we find a smaller variability amplitude for the reprocessed flux compared to the direct emission. The power-law cutoff energy is constrained at 96$^{+47}_{-24}$ keV, which position the system in the allowable parameter space due to the pair production limit.

  Atomic hydrogen (HI) serves a crucial role in connecting galactic-scale properties such as star formation with the large-scale structure of the Universe. While recent numerical simulations have successfully matched the observed covering fraction of HI near Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and in the foreground of luminous quasars at redshifts $z \lesssim 3$, the low-mass end remains as-of-yet unexplored in observational and computational surveys. We employ a cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation (FIREbox) supplemented with zoom-in simulations (MassiveFIRE) from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project to investigate the HI covering fraction of Lyman Limit Systems ($N_{\mathrm{HI}} \gtrsim 10^{17.2}$ cm$^{-2}$) across a wide range of redshifts ($z=0-6$) and halo masses ($10^8-10^{13} M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, $10^8-10^{11} M_{\odot}$ at $z=6$) in the absence of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the covering fraction inside haloes exhibits a strong increase with redshift, with only a weak dependence on halo mass for higher-mass haloes. For massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{vir}} \sim 10^{11}-10^{12} M_{\odot}$), the radial profiles showcase scale-invariance and remain independent of mass. The radial dependence is well-captured by a fitting function. The covering fractions in our simulations are in good agreement with measurements of the covering fraction in LBGs. Our comprehensive analysis unveils a complex dependence with redshift and halo mass for haloes with $M_{\mathrm{vir}} \lesssim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ that future observations aim to constrain, providing key insights into the physics of structure formation and gas assembly.

  We use high-resolution data from the millimetre-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM) project to investigate the connection between circumnuclear gas reservoirs and nuclear activity in a sample of nearby galaxies. Our sample spans a wide range of nuclear activity types including radio galaxies, Seyfert galaxies, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) and inactive galaxies. We use measurements of nuclear millimetre continuum emission along with other archival tracers of AGN accretion/activity to investigate previous claims that at, circumnuclear scales (&lt;100 pc), these should correlate with the mass of the cold molecular gas. We find that the molecular gas mass does not correlate with any tracer of nuclear activity. This suggests the level of nuclear activity cannot solely be regulated by the amount of cold gas around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This indicates that AGN fuelling, that drives gas from the large scale galaxy to the nuclear regions, is not a ubiquitous process and may vary between AGN type, with timescale variations likely to be very important. By studying the structure of the central molecular gas reservoirs, we find our galaxies have a range of nuclear molecular gas concentrations. This could indicate that some of our galaxies may have had their circumnuclear regions impacted by AGN feedback, even though they currently have low nuclear activity. On the other hand, the nuclear molecular gas concentrations in our galaxies could instead be set by secular processes.   

A high incidence of dusty H$α$ emitters at $z&gt;3$ among UltraVISTA
  dropout galaxies in COSMOS revealed by JWST

  We have characterized 26 Spitzer/IRAC-selected sources from the SMUVS program that are undetected in the UltraVISTA DR5 H- and/or Ks-band images, covering 94 square arcmin of the COSMOS field which have deep multi-wavelength JWST photometry. We analyzed the JWST/NIRCam imaging from the PRIMER survey and ancillary HST data to reveal the properties of these galaxies from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We find that the majority of these galaxies are detected by NIRCam at &lt;2 micron, with only four remaining as near-infrared dropouts in the deeper JWST images. Our results indicate that the UltraVISTA dropouts candidates are primarily located at z&gt;3 and are characterized by high dust extinctions, with a typical colour excess E(B-V) = 0.5 pm 0.3 and stellar mass log(M*/Msun) = 9.5 pm 1.0. Remarkably, ~75% of these sources show a flux enhancement between the observed photometry and modelled continuum SED that can be attributed to Halpha emission in the corresponding NIRCam bands. The derived (Halpha+ N[II] + S[II]) rest-frame equivalent widths and Halpha star formation rates (SFRs) span values ~100-2200 A and ~5-375 Msun/yr, respectively. The locations of these sources on the SFR-M* plane indicates that 35% of them are starbursts, 40% are main-sequence galaxies and the remaining 25% are located in the star-formation valley. Our sample includes one AGN and three sub-millimeter sources, as revealed from ancillary X-ray and sub-mm photometry. The high dust extinctions combined with the flux boosting from Halpha emission explain why these sources are relatively bright Spitzer galaxies and yet unidentified in the ultra-deep UltraVISTA near-infrared images.

  In this Research Highlights, we summarize 31 contributions provided during the Workshop \textit{Multifrequency Behaviour of High Energy Cosmic Sources - XIV}, held in Palermo (Italy) from the 12th to the 17th of June 2023. We will start with the most recent discoveries in the field of gravitational waves (GWs). We will connect this topic to the contributions of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) associated with GWs and with the Kilonovae (KNe) hunting and, more in general, on GRBs. Continuing on high-energy astrophysics objects, we will delve into Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), neutrino astronomy and the study of the primordial universe, both from the space telescopes' observation and from the very recent proposals in terms of cosmological models. From the faraway universe, we will move to the more local scales and discuss the recent observations in Supernova Remnants (SNRs), massive star binaries, globular cluster dynamics, and exoplanets observed by Kepler.   

An ALMA Spectroscopic Survey of the Brightest Submillimeter Galaxies in

  We report physical properties of the brightest ($S_{870\,\mu \rm m}=12.4$-$19.2\,$mJy) and not strongly lensed 18 870$\,\mu$m selected dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), also known as submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), in the COSMOS field. This sample is part of an ALMA band$\,$3 spectroscopic survey (AS2COSPEC), and spectroscopic redshifts are measured in 17 of them at $z=2$-$5$. We perform spectral energy distribution analyses and deduce a median total infrared luminosity of $L_{\rm IR}=(1.3\pm0.1)\times10^{13}\,L_{\odot}$, infrared-based star-formation rate of ${\rm SFR}_{\rm IR}=1390\pm150~M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$, stellar mass of $M_\ast=(1.4\pm0.6)\times10^{11}\,M_\odot$, dust mass of $M_{\rm dust}=(3.7\pm0.5)\times10^9\,M_\odot$, and molecular gas mass of $M_{\rm gas}= (\alpha_{\rm CO}/0.8)(1.2\pm0.1)\times10^{11}\,M_\odot$, suggesting that they are one of the most massive, ISM-enriched, and actively star-forming systems at $z=2$-$5$. In addition, compared to less massive and less active galaxies at similar epochs, SMGs have comparable gas fractions; however, they have much shorter depletion time, possibly caused by more active dynamical interactions. We determine a median dust emissivity index of $\beta=2.1\pm0.1$ for our sample, and by combining our results with those from other DSFG samples, we find no correlation of $\beta$ with redshift or infrared luminosity, indicating similar dust grain compositions across cosmic time for infrared luminous galaxies. We also find that AS2COSPEC SMGs have one of the highest dust-to-stellar mass ratios, with a median of $0.02\pm0.01$, significantly higher than model predictions, possibly due to too strong of a AGN feedback implemented in the model. Finally, our complete and uniform survey enables us to put constraints on the most massive end of the dust and molecular gas mass functions.   

Revealing Impact of Critical Stellar Central Density on Galaxy Quenching
  through Cosmic Time

  In the previous work of Xu &amp; Peng (2021), we investigated the structural and environmental dependence on quenching in the nearby universe. In this work we extend our investigations to higher redshifts by combining galaxies from SDSS and ZFOURGE surveys. In low density, we find a characteristic $\Sigma_{1\ kpc}$ above which the quenching is initiated as indicated by their population-averaged color. $\Sigma^{crit}_{1\ kpc}$ shows only weakly mass-dependency at all redshifts, which suggests that the internal quenching process is more related to the physics that acts in the central region of galaxies. In high density, $\Sigma^{crit}_{1\ kpc}$ for galaxies at $z &gt; 1$ is almost indistinguishable with their low-density counterparts. At $z &lt; 1$, $\Sigma^{crit}_{1\ kpc}$ for low-mass galaxies becomes progressively strongly mass-dependent, which is due to the increasingly stronger environmental effects at lower redshifts. $\Sigma^{crit}_{1\ kpc}$ in low density shows strong redshift evolution with $\sim 1$ dex decrement from $z = 2.5$ to $z = 0$. It is likely due to that at a given stellar mass, the host halo is on average more massive and gas-rich at higher redshifts, hence a higher level of integrated energy from more massive black hole is required to quench. As the halo evolves from cold to hot accretion phase at lower redshifts, the gas is shock-heated and becomes more vulnerable to AGN feedback processes, as predicted by theory. Meanwhile, angular momentum quenching also becomes more effective at low redshifts, which complements a lower level of integrated energy from black hole to quench.
