  The latest results of the most detailed analysis of multi-epoch polarization-sensitive observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets at parsecs scales by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) reveal several characteristic patterns of linear polarization distribution and its variability (Pushkarev et al., 2023; Zobnina et al., 2023). Some of the observed profiles can be reproduced by a simple model of a jet threaded by a helical magnetic field. However, none of the models presented to date can explain the observed polarization profiles with an increase in its degree towards the edges of the jet, and accompanied by a 'fountain' type electric vector pattern and its high temporal variability in the center. Based on simulations of the VLBI observations of relativistic jets, we show here that the observed transverse linear polarization profiles, atypical for the simple magnetic field models can be naturally produced assuming the finite resolution of VLBI arrays and precession of a jet on ten-years scales, observational indications of which are found in an increasing number of AGN. In our simulations, we qualitatively reproduce the distribution of the electric vector and its variability, though the polarization images are characterized by a bright spine due to weak smearing, which is poorly consistent with observations. More effective depolarization can be obtained in models with the suppressed emission of the jet spine.

  We present a uniform and sensitive X-ray census of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the two nearest galaxy clusters, Virgo and Fornax, utilizing the newly released X-ray source catalogs from the first all-sky scan of SRG/eROSITA. A total of 50 and 10 X-ray sources are found positionally coincident with the nuclei of member galaxies in Virgo and Fornax, respectively, down to a 0.2--2.3 keV luminosity of $\sim10^{39}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ and reaching out to a projected distance well beyond the virial radius of both clusters. The majority of the nuclear X-ray sources are newly identified. There is weak evidence that the nuclear X-ray sources are preferentially found in late-type hosts. Several hosts are dwarf galaxies with a stellar mass below $\sim10^{9}\rm~M_\odot$. We find that contamination by non-nuclear X-ray emission can be neglected in most cases, indicating the dominance of a genuine AGN. In the meantime, no nuclear X-ray source exhibits a luminosity higher than a few times $10^{41}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$. The X-ray AGN occupation rate is only $\sim$3\% in both clusters, apparently much lower than that in field galaxies inferred from previous X-ray studies. Both aspects suggest that the cluster environment effectively suppresses AGN activity. The findings of this census have important implications on the interplay between galaxies and their central massive black holes in cluster environments.

  We study the black hole mass $-$ host galaxy stellar mass relation, $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$, of a sample of $z&lt;4$ optically-variable AGNs in the COSMOS field. The parent sample of 491 COSMOS AGNs were identified by optical variability from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) program. Using publicly-available catalogs and spectra, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts and estimate virial black hole masses using broad line widths and luminosities. We show that variability searches with deep, high precision photometry like the HSC-SSP can identity AGNs in low mass galaxies up to $z\sim1$. However, their black holes are more massive given their host galaxy stellar masses than predicted by the local relation for active galaxies. We report that $z\sim 0.5-4$ variability-selected AGNs are meanwhile more consistent with the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation for local inactive early-type galaxies. This result is consistent with most previous studies of the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation at similar redshifts and indicates that AGNs selected from variability are not intrinsically different from the broad-line Type 1 AGN population at similar luminosities. Our results demonstrate the need for robust black hole and stellar mass estimates for intermediate-mass black hole candidates in low-mass galaxies at similar redshifts. Assuming that these results do not reflect a selection bias, they appear to be consistent with self-regulated feedback models wherein the central black hole and stars in galaxies grow in tandem.

  Sub/millimeter galaxies are a key population for the study of galaxy evolution because the majority of star formation at high redshifts occurred in galaxies deeply embedded in dust. To search for this population, we have performed an extensive survey with ALMA, called the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). This survey covers 133 arcmin^2 area and securely detects 180 sources at z~0.5-6 with a flux limit of ~0.2 mJy at 1.2 mm (Fujimoto et al. 2023). Here we report the results of multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of the whole ALCS sample, utilizing the observed-frame UV to millimeter photometry. We find that the majority of the ALCS sources lie on the star-forming main sequence, with a smaller fraction showing intense starburst activities. The ALCS sample contains high infrared-excess sources IRX=log(Ldust/LUV)&gt;1), including two extremely dust-obscured galaxies (IRX&gt;5). We also confirm that the ALCS sample probes a broader range in lower dust mass than conventional SMG samples in the same redshift range. We identify six heavily obscured AGN candidates that are not detected in the archival Chandra data in addition to the three X-ray AGNs reported by Uematsu et al. (2023). The inferred AGN luminosity density shows a possible excess at z=2-3 compared with that determined from X-ray surveys below 10 keV.
