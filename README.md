Aims. This study investigates the relationship between the Mg II λ2798 Å emission line and the 3000 Å continuum luminosity, as well as the Baldwin Effect, in a sample of 40,685 radio-quiet (RQ) quasars and 441 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs). Methods. We perform a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Mg II-3000 Å correlation, explicitly accounting for dispersion introduced by AGN variability. After excluding &gt;3000 radio-loud sources, we employ a binning technique to mitigate variability effects, yielding a refined empirical relation. We also further examine the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, to investigate the dominant source of the continuum. Results. Our analysis reveals statistically significant differences in the slopes of the line-continuum luminosity relation between RQ quasars and FSRQs, with a parallel discrepancy in the Baldwin Effect. These findings imply either (1) intrinsic differences in the accretion disk spectra of RQ AGNs and FSRQs or (2) jet-induced continuum emission in FSRQs contributing to Broad Line Region (BLR) ionization. We also found that a substantial fraction of both RQ quasars (43.8\%) and blazars (55.5\%) exhibit NTD &lt; 1. For blazars, this suggests that the accretion disk alone cannot fully explain BLR ionization; while we interpret NTD &lt; 1 in radio-quiet quasars as a signature of several physical mechanisms: anomalies in the BLR structure (such as outflow or inflows), time lags between continuum and line variations, and the suppression of the UV continuum by a strong corona that diverts accretion power. Finally, we demonstrate that the Baldwin Effect emerges naturally from the line-continuum luminosity relationship, requiring no additional physical mechanism to explain its origin

We searched the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph archive for ultraviolet spectra of 428 AGN to identify intrinsic NV absorption systems. We filtered out Type 2 AGN, blazars, and spectra that do not cover at least part of the velocity window from 5000 km/s blueward to 5000 km/s redward (hereafter, the ``associated'' region) of the NV emission line. This yielded 175 Type 1 quasars, 34 radio-loud, 133 radio-quiet, and eight unconstrained. Our survey uncovered 77 associated NV systems in the spectra of 48 of these low-redshift quasars. We consider the incidence of intrinsic absorbers as a function of quasar properties (optical, radio and X-ray). We find a statistically significant dearth of intrinsic NV systems in the spectra of the 34 radio-loud quasars (6%), compared to 29% of the 133 radio-quiet quasars containing at least one intrinsic system. Assuming intrinsic systems are equally likely to occur in radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars and the orientations of the two subsamples are comparable, there is a 0.1% probability of such a deficit occurring by chance in the radio-loud population. We propose that this deficit of systems is caused by orientation effects. FIRST radio images are available for 14 of the 33 radio-loud quasars. These show that only three of the 14 radio-loud quasars have lobe-dominated morphologies, whereas 11 of the 14 radio-loud quasars have compact radio morphologies, implying that these quasars are face on, and suggesting that clouds that produce NV absorption are rarely found along the polar axis.

The Circinus galaxy is the nearest type-2 Seyfert galaxy, which is at a distance of 4.2 Mpc. Its environment is challenging to explore because it is located at low Galactic latitudes, behind the Galactic disc. The long-term goal is to characterise the Circinus galaxy halo and determine the presence of dwarf satellites using near-infrared data. We selected 1,542 galaxies from the VVV NIRGC within a 2-degree radius around Circinus, representing 2/3 of the virial radius. Structural parameters such as half-light radii and colours were used, and correlations were examined. A neural network was trained with 486 galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts to estimate photometric redshifts for all galaxies. Potential satellites were defined based on half-light radii compatible with the typical sizes of dwarf satellites, and combined with photometric redshifts. The galaxy properties are reliably characterised down to $K_{s}$ $\sim$ 15.5 mag, which represents about 90% completeness of detections. At the distance of Circinus, this limiting magnitude corresponds to $K_{s}$ absolute magnitude of $-12.6$ mag, which allows us to find dwarf galaxies. There are 20 galaxies with half-light radii larger than 2.45 arcsec, only 8 have photometric redshifts below 0.04. None of these galaxies is close to Circinus, which has a redshift of 0.0015. The ANNz model exhibited a high degree of accuracy in the range $0.001 &lt; z_{phot} &lt; 0.023$. The presence of dwarf satellites could not be confirmed with the available data in the studied region. The apparent lack of satellites may be genuine, possibly related to AGN feedback effects. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining near-infrared data and machine learning techniques to estimate photometric redshifts at low Galactic latitudes, providing useful information for future spectroscopic follow-up campaigns.

The tight empirical $M-σ$ relation between the mass of a SMBH) and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy bulge is often interpreted as the result of self-regulation by AGN feedback. This picture is motivated by analytical and semi-analytical models in which momentum-driven AGN winds can expel the gas once the SMBH reaches a critical mass. However, these models typically assume idealised conditions: smooth gas distributions, spherical symmetry, and very efficient cooling of the shocked AGN wind.   We checked whether AGN outflows can establish the $M-σ$ relation in a multi-phase and turbulent galactic bulge subject to realistic radiative cooling while conserving the shocked AGN wind energy.   We calculated a suite of purpose-built hydrodynamical simulations of AGN outflows in turbulent gas shells, covering a wide range of constant AGN luminosities. We tracked the outflow evolution over the course of $\geq1$~Myr. We analysed the effect of AGN outflow on the cold dense gas and SMBH feeding, estimating the luminosity threshold for removing most of the cold gas from the central regions.   We find that AGNs with significantly sub-Eddington luminosities cannot suppress SMBH feeding, while luminosities exceeding $\sim 0.7$ times Eddington clear out both the diffuse hot gas and the cold clumps, consistent with the momentum-driven outflow formalism. We also show that dense gas clusters are affected almost exclusively by the AGN wind momentum, while the shocked wind energy escapes through low-density channels and inflates large bubbles of diffuse gas. Therefore, AGN wind-driven energy-conserving feedback in a turbulent multi-phase medium affects the dense gas only via the wind momentum. Thus, the momentum-driven outflow paradigm is applicable for explaining the $M-σ$ relation even in realistic systems.

From a parent catalog of 561 changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) identified by Guo et al. (2025), we investigate the evolutionary sequence of broad emission lines using a redshift-selected subset (0.35 &lt; z &lt; 0.45) of 54 CL-AGNs whose Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) spectra simultaneously cover the Hα, H\b{eta}, and Mg II emission lines. To provide a baseline for comparison, we construct a control sample of 19,897 normal Type 1 AGNs within the same redshift range from the DESI Year 1 data. Through stacked spectral analysis and line-continuum luminosity correlations, we identify a clear evolutionary sequence in all AGN where broad H\b{eta} fades first, followed by Mg II, and then Hα, as the AGN luminosity declines - consistent with expectations from reverberation mapping. This trend reflects a radially stratified broad line region (BLR), where each line's responsivity depends on its ionization potential and radial distance from the central engine. In addition, we find that more massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs) require lower Eddington ratios to fully suppress broad emission lines, suggesting that the critical accretion threshold for the CL phenomenon is mass-dependent. Our results present the first statistical confirmation of a stratified broad line fading sequence in AGNs, reinforcing the central role of accretion state in shaping BLR structure and visibility.

Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors have discovered about 200 compact object mergers. The astrophysical origins of these events are highly debated, and it is possible that at least a fraction of them originate from dynamical environments. Among these, the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are particularly interesting as promising environments, as some observed properties may be more readily produced there. When compact objects merge in these environments, acceleration from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) or nearby companions is inevitable. Such acceleration induces a phase shift in the observed GW waveforms, which can serve as a useful tool to distinguish the underlying merging environments for each GW event. In this paper, we investigate the expected distribution of such acceleration-induced GW phase shifts, using a semi-analytical model combined with a one-dimensional AGN population synthesis code. We find significant contributions from three-body interactions involving a nearby third object. Our results indicate that the GW phase shift is likely to be larger compared to other channels, making it distinguishable by future GW facilities such as TianQin, DECIGO, Taiji, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer. Interestingly, a notable fraction of mergers in fact exhibit a significant GW phase shift ($\gtrsim~{\rm 1\ rad}$) at frequencies above $10~{\rm Hz}$, which could even be detectable by current GW detectors such as LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Additionally, if gas-hardening during three-body interactions is taken into account, the GW frequency can be boosted to $\gtrsim 10~{\rm Hz}$, potentially further aiding in the detection of the phase shift.

The observable characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) embedded in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are mainly determined by the jet propagation within the disk. In the massive collapsar scenario, we consider that the mass and metallicity of progenitor stars can significantly affect the jet durations and luminosities, which in turn influence whether the jet can break out from AGN disks. For the cases with low metallicity, massive stars tend to keep their massive envelopes. Thus the hyperaccretion of these envelopes onto the newborn black holes (BHs) can prolong the activity duration of the central engine, thereby allowing the jets to potentially break out from the disks. For successful jets, we further study their prompt emission and afterglows for different supermassive BHs and locations and discuss the detectability of these signals by instruments such as \emph{Swift} and Einstein Probe. Future related observations will help constrain the structure, components, and evolutionary history of AGN disks and the massive stars embedded within them.

Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating soft X-ray flares associated with galactic nuclei. Several recent works have found evidence that the accretion flow in the galactic nuclei of QPEs is of recent origin, and that it is unlike canonical active galactic nuclei (AGN). A precursor tidal disruption event has been observed in a few cases. In this work we report new radio observations of the QPE host galaxy RXJ\,1301.9+2747 taken at 5.0\,GHz with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA), to complement archival 1.7\,GHz observations reported previously. Our new observations confirm the presence of a highly compact radio source in RXJ\,1301.9+2747, which is smaller than $0.9\times0.4~\mathrm{pc}$ at 5.0\,GHz. The nonsimultaneous very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) compact flux of the source is consistent with a negative spectral index, and thus is similar to the larger non-VLBI scale radio spectral index. Contrary to earlier results at 1.7\,GHz, we find the 5\,GHz emission offset from the optical Gaia position, which may be due to dust extinction in the host galaxy. In addition, there is a significant offset between the 1.7 and 5.0\,GHz data, which may result from astrophysical uncertainties in the calibration source. This sheds new light on the elusive properties of the radio-detected QPE sources. Consistent with previous results, our observations disfavor a star formation or jet-core-region origin of the radio emission. We cannot rule out a reconnection-driven scenario for the radio emission, but we favor a remnant jet or outflow scenario. This is overall in agreement with the radio properties of radio-detected QPE sources at lower angular resolution.

We introduce J-HERTz (J-PLUS Heritage Exploration of Radio Targets at $z &lt; 5$), a new multi-wavelength catalog that combines optical narrow-band photometry from J-PLUS, infrared observations from WISE, and deep low-frequency radio data from LoTSS for nearly half a million sources across 2,100 deg$^2$ of the northern sky. Key innovations of J-HERTz include Bayesian neural network classifications for 390,000 galaxies, 31,000 quasars, and 20,000 stars, along with significantly improved photometric redshifts for 235,000 galaxies compared to previous J-PLUS DR3 and LoTSS DR2 estimates. We identify 831 candidate Galactic radio stars, which, if confirmed, would constitute a significant addition to the number of radio-emitting stars identified to date. Among radio-loud galaxies with spectroscopic observations, $\gtrsim$20% lack Seyfert or LINER signatures, indicating a substantial population of optically quiescent radio galaxies, in agreement with previous works. Spectral energy distribution fitting of their host galaxies using J-PLUS photospectra reveals systematically low specific star formation rates, consistent with quenched stellar populations. J-HERTz thus provides a powerful dataset to exploit radio-optical synergies, enabling studies that span from the origin of stellar radio emission to the AGN life cycle and the role of jet activity in shaping host galaxy evolution.

We use the VST-COSMOS survey to identify, via their optical broadband variability, 30 AGN in nearby (z&lt;0.4) dwarf (10^8 MSun &lt; M &lt; 10^10 MSun) galaxies. VST-COSMOS offers a 1 deg^2 survey footprint, a single visit depth of 24.6 mag and 68 r-band visits spanning an eleven-year temporal baseline. Compared to a control sample matched in stellar mass and redshift, the dwarf AGN population shows an elevated fraction of early-type galaxies but a similar fraction of interacting objects, suggesting that interactions do not play a significant role in triggering these AGN. Dwarf AGN hosts do not show strong differences in their distances to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies compared to the controls, which indicates that AGN triggering, at least in this sample, is not strongly correlated with environment. Finally, by combining the true number of galaxies, the detectability of AGN and the measured numbers of variable sources in dwarf and massive (M &gt; 10^10 MSun) galaxies, we estimate the relative frequency of AGN in these two mass regimes. Our results suggest that the incidence of AGN in dwarfs and massive galaxies is similar (within less than a factor of 2 of each other), with some evidence that the AGN fraction increases with stellar mass in the dwarf population.  

Mixing between AGN winds and ISM clouds produces luminous X-ray emission

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive powerful, multiphase outflows that are thought to play a key role in galaxy evolution. The hot, shocked phase of these outflows ($T \gtrsim 10^{6} \rm{\ K}$) is expected to dominate the energy content, but is challenging to observe due to its long cooling time and low emissivity. The cool phase ($T \lesssim 10^{4} \rm{\ K}$) is easier to detect observationally, but it traces a less energetic outflow component. In prior simulations of the interaction between an energy-driven AGN outflow and a clumpy ISM, we found that mixing between hot wind and cool ISM clouds produces a new, highly radiative, phase at $T \approx 10^{6-7} \rm{\ K}$ which fuels the formation of a long-lived ($\geq 5\ \rm{Myr}$) cool outflow. We investigate the X-ray emission generated by thermal Bremsstrahlung and high-ionisation metal line emission in this mixing phase, finding that it could contribute significantly to the X-ray output of the outflow. This mixing-induced X-ray emission is strongest in the part of the outflow propagating equatorially through the disc, and is extended on scales of $D\simeq 3-4\ \rm{kpc}$. For quasar luminosities of $L_{\rm{AGN}}\simeq 10^{45-46}\rm{\ erg\ s^{-1}}$, the resulting X-ray luminosity is equivalent to that expected from star formation rates $\rm{SFR}\simeq 10-200\ \rm{M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$, showing that it could be an important source of soft X-rays in AGN host galaxies. Our results suggest that this extended emission could be resolvable in local quasars ($z\lesssim 0.11$) using high spatial-resolution X-ray observatories such as Chandra, or proposed missions such as AXIS and Lynx.
