  The XLF of AGN offers a robust tool to study the evolution and the growth of SMBHs over cosmic time. Owing to the limited area probed by X-ray surveys, optical surveys are routinely used to probe the accretion in the high redshift Universe $z\geq 3$. However, optical surveys may be incomplete because they are strongly affected by dust redenning. In this work, we derive the XLF and its evolution at high redshifts using a large sample of AGNs selected in different fields with various areas and depths covering a wide range of luminosities. Additionally, we put the tightest yet constraints on the absorption function in this redshift regime. In particular, we use more than 600 soft X-ray selected high-z sources in the Chandra Deep fields, the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey and the XMM-XXL northern field. We derive the X-ray spectral properties for all sources via spectral fitting, using a consistent technique and model. For modeling the parametric form of the XLF and the absorption function, we use a Bayesian methodology allowing us to correctly propagate the uncertainties for the observed X-ray properties of our sources and also the absorption effects. The evolution of XLF is in agreement with a pure density evolution model similar to what is witnessed at optical wavelengths, although a luminosity dependent density evolution model cannot be securely ruled out. A large fraction ($60\%)$ of our sources are absorbed by column densities of $\rm N_H \geq 10^{23} cm^{-2} $, while $17$\% of the sources are CTK. Our results favor a scenario where both the ISM of the host and the AGN torus contribute to the obscuration. The derived BHAD is in agreement with the simulations, if one takes into account that the X-ray AGN are hosted by massive galaxies, while it differs from the one derived using JWST data. The latter could be due to the differences in the AGN and host-galaxy properties.

  We report the direct detection of Lyman Continuum (LyC) emission from 9 galaxies and 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at $z$ $\sim$ 1.1-1.6 in the GOODS-North field using deep observations from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. The absolute escape fraction of the sources estimated from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) and H$\alpha$ line luminosities using Monte Carlo (MC) analysis of two Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM) models span a range $\sim$ 10 - 55 $\%$. The restframe UV wavelength of the sources falls in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) regime $\sim$ 550-700 \AA, the shortest LyC wavelength range probed so far. This redshift range remains devoid of direct detections of LyC emission due to the instrumental limitations of previously available facilities. With UVIT having a very low detector noise, each of these sources are detected with an individual signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;$ 3 while for the stack of six sources, we achieve an SNR $\sim$ 7.4. The LyC emission is seen to be offset from the optical centroids and extended beyond the UVIT PSF of 1.$^{\prime\prime}6$ in most of the sources. This sample fills an important niche between GALEX and Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) at low-$z$, and HST WFC3 at high-$z$ and is crucial in understanding the evolution of LyC leakers.

  A fundamental question in galaxy and black-hole evolution remains how galaxies and their supermassive black holes have evolved together over cosmic time. Specifically, it is still unclear how the position of X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies with respect to the star-forming main sequence (MS) may change with the X-ray luminosity ($L_\mathrm{X}$) of the AGN or the stellar mass ($M_\star$) of the host galaxy. We use data from XMM-SERVS to probe this issue. XMM-SERVS is covered by the largest medium-depth X-ray survey (with superb supporting multiwavelength data) and thus contains the largest sample to date for study. To ensure consistency, we locally derive the MS from a large reference galaxy sample. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the turnover of the galaxy MS does not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn for high-mass AGNs, and we establish a robust safe regime where the results do not depend upon the choice of MS definition. Under this framework, our results indicate that less-massive AGN host-galaxies ($\log M_\star\sim9.5-10.5$ $M_\odot$) generally possess enhanced SFRs compared to their normal-galaxy counterparts while the more-massive AGN host galaxies ($\log M_\star\sim10.5-11.5$ $M_\odot$) lie on or below the star-forming MS. Further, we propose an empirical model for how the placement of an AGN with respect to the MS (SFR$_{norm}$) evolves as a function of both $M_\star$ and $L_\mathrm{X}$.

  We present HOMERUN (Highly Optimized Multi-cloud Emission-line Ratios Using photo-ionizatioN), a new approach to modelling emission lines from photoionized gas that can simultaneously reproduce all observed line intensities from a wide range of ionization levels and with high accuracy. Our approach is based on the weighted combination of multiple single-cloud photoionization models and, contrary to previous works, the novelty of our approach consists in using the weights as free parameters of the fit and constraining them with the observed data. One of the main applications of HOMERUN is the accurate determination of gas-phase metallicities and we show that a critical point is to allow for a variation of the N/O and S/O abundance ratios which can significantly improve the quality of the fit and the accuracy of the results. Moreover, our approach provides a major improvement compared to the single-cloud, constant-pressure models commonly used in the literature. By using high-quality literature spectra of H ii regions where 10 to 20 emission lines (including several auroral lines) are detected with high signal-to-noise ratio, we show that all lines are reproduced by the model with an accuracy better than 10%. In particular, the model is able to simultaneously reproduce [O i], [O ii], [O iii], [S ii], and [S iii] emission lines which, to our knowledge, is an unprecedented result. Finally, we show that the gas metallicities estimated with our models for HII regions in the Milky Way are in agreement with the stellar metallicities than the estimates based on the Te-method. Overall, our method provides a new accurate tool to estimate the metallicity and the physical conditions of the ionized gas. It can be applied to many different science cases from HII regions to AGN and wherever there are emission lines from photoionized gas.
