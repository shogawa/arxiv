  Broad absorption line (BAL) outflows are commonly detected in active galactic nuclei (AGN), but their driving mechanism remains poorly constrained. Here we investigate whether radiation pressure on dust can adequately explain the BAL phenomenon observed in quasars. In the framework of our AGN radiative dusty feedback scenario, we show that dust-driven outflows can reach BAL wind-like velocities ($v \sim 10^4$ km/s) on galactic scales ($r \lesssim 1$ kpc). This is consistent with recent observations indicating that BAL acceleration typically occurs on scales of $\sim 10$ pc, and that the majority of BAL outflows are located at galactocentric radii greater than $\sim 100$ pc. We derive the outflow radial velocity profile and compute the associated outflow momentum rate and kinetic power, which are found to be in agreement with the outflow energetics measured in BAL quasars. Therefore radiation pressure on dust may account for the observed BAL outflow dynamics and energetics. Furthermore, we consider BAL clouds/clumps (leading to a clumpy BAL flow characterised by a wide range of outflowing velocities), and we analyse how the resulting covering factors affect the shape of the absorption line profiles. We conclude that dust-driven BAL outflows may provide a significant contribution to AGN feedback on galactic scales.

  We present a multi-wavelength analysis of MCG+11-11-032, a nearby AGN with the unique classification of both a binary and a dual AGN candidate. With new Chandra observations we aim to resolve any dual AGN system via imaging data, and search for signs of a binary AGN via analysis of the X-ray spectrum. Analyzing the Chandra spectrum, we find no evidence of previously suggested double-peaked Fe K$\alpha$ lines; the spectrum is instead best fit by an absorbed powerlaw with a single Fe K$\alpha$ line, as well as an additional line centered at $\approx$7.5 keV. The Chandra observation reveals faint, soft, and extended X-ray emission, possibly linked to low-level nuclear outflows. Further analysis shows evidence for a compact, hard source -- MCG+11-11-032 X2 -- located 3.27'' from the primary AGN. Modeling MCG+11-11-032 X2 as a compact source, we find that it is relatively luminous ($L_{\text{2$-$10 keV}} = 1.52_{-0.48}^{+0.96}\times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and the location is coincident with an compact and off-nuclear source resolved in Hubble Space Telescope infrared (F105W) and ultraviolet (F621M, F547M) bands. Pairing our X-ray results with a 144 MHz radio detection at the host galaxy location, we observe X-ray and radio properties similar to those of ESO 243-49 HLX-1, suggesting that MCG+11-11-032 X2 may be a hyper-luminous X-ray source. This detection with Chandra highlights the importance of a high-resolution X-ray imager, and how previous binary AGN candidates detected with large-aperture instruments benefit from high-resolution follow-up. Future spatially resolved optical spectra, and deeper X-ray observations, can better constrain the origin of MCG+11-11-032 X2.
