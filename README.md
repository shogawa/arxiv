  We report on a detailed study of a luminous, heavily obscured ($N_{\rm H} \sim 2 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), radio-loud quasar SRGAJ230631.0+155633, discovered in the 4--12 keV energy band by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope aboard the SRG observatory during the first two years of its all-sky X-ray survey in 2020--2021. The object is located at $z=0.4389$ and is a type 2 AGN according to optical spectroscopy (SDSS, confirmed by DESI). Our analysis combines data from the radio to the X-ray energy range, including quasi-simultaneous pointed observations with the SRG/ART-XC and Swift/XRT telescopes, conducted in June 2023. During these follow-up observations, the source was found in a significantly fainter but still very luminous state ($L_{\rm X}=1.0^{+0.8}_{-0.3} \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, absorption corrected, 2--10 keV) compared to its discovery during the all-sky survey ($L_{\rm X}=6^{+6}_{-3}\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$), which indicates significant intrinsic variability on a rest-frame time scale of $\sim 1$ year. The radio data show a complex morphology with a core and two extended radio lobes, indicating a giant FRII radio galaxy. Using multiwavelength photometry and the black hole--bulge mass scaling relation, we estimate the bolometric luminosity of the quasar at $\sim 6\times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the mass of its central black hole at $\sim 1.4 \times 10^9$ $M_\odot$. This implies that the black hole is accreting at $\sim 30$ of the Eddington limit. Overall, SRGAJ230631.0+155633 proves to be one of the most luminous obscured quasars in the observable Universe out to $z=0.5$ (i.e. over the last 5 billion years of cosmic time). As such, it can serve as a valuable testbed for in-depth exploration of the physics of such objects, which were much more abundant in the younger Universe.

  Supermassive black hole mergers with spin-flips accelerate energetic particles through their precessing relativistic jets, producing high energy neutrinos and finally gravitational waves. In star formation massive stars come in pairs, triplets and quadruplets, allowing second generation mergers of the remnants with discrepant spin directions. The Gravitational Wave (GW) data support such a scenario. Earlier we suggested that stellar mass black hole mergers (visible in M82) with an associated spin-flip analogously allow the acceleration of energetic particles, with ensuing high energy neutrinos and high energy photons, and finally producing gravitational waves. At cosmic distances only the gravitational waves and the neutrinos remain detectable. Here we generalize the argument to starburst and normal galaxies throughout their cosmic evolution, and show that these galaxies may dominate over Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the flux of ultra-high energy particles observed at Earth. All these sources contribute to the cosmic neutrino background, as well as the gravitational wave background (they detected the lower frequencies). We outline a search strategy to find such episodic sources, which requires to include both luminosity and flux density.

  The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.
