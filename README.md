  We present observations of the type-2 Seyfert NGC7172 obtained with the medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. This galaxy hosts one of the lowest ionised gas mass outflow rates (Mout~0.005 M/yr) in a sample of six AGN with similar bolometric luminosities (log Lbol~44erg/s) within the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We aim to understand the properties of the ionised gas outflow, mainly using the emission lines from the neon transitions, that cover a broad range of ionisation potentials (IP) from ~20 eV to ~130 eV. We applied parametric and non-parametric methods to characterise the line emission and kinematics. The low excitation lines (IP&lt;25eV, e.g.[NeII]) trace the rotating disc emission. The high excitation lines (IP&gt;90eV, e.g.[NeV]), which are likely photoionised exclusively by the AGN, are expanding in the direction nearly perpendicular to the disc of the galaxy, with maximum projected velocities of ~350-500 km/s. In particular, [NeV] and [NeVI] lines reveal a biconical ionised gas outflow emerging N-S from the nuclear region, extending at least ~2.5"N and 3.8"S (projected distance of ~450 and 680 pc). Most of the emission arising in the northern part of the cone was not previously detected due to obscuration. Given the almost face-on orientation of the outflow and the almost edge-on orientation of the galaxy, NGC7172 may be a case of weak coupling. Nevertheless, we found evidence for positive feedback in two distinct outflowing clumps at projected distances of 3.1" and 4.3" (i.e. ~560 and 780 pc) SW from the AGN. We estimated a star formation rate in these regions using the [NeII] and [NeIII] luminosities of 0.08 M/yr, that is ~10% of that found in the circumnuclear ring. The star formation activity might have been triggered by the interaction between the ionised gas outflow and the ISM of the galaxy.

  We present in this paper the discovery, properties, and a catalog of 1165 high redshift $6.5 &lt; z &lt; 18$ galaxies found in deep JWST NIRCam imaging from the GTO PEARLS survey combined with data from JWST public fields. We describe our bespoke homogeneous reduction process and our analysis of these areas including the NEP, CEERS, GLASS, NGDEEP, JADES, and ERO SMACS-0723 fields with over 214 arcmin$^{2}$ imaged to depths of $\sim 30$ mag. We describe our rigorous methods for identifying these galaxies, involving the use of Lyman-break strength, detection significance criteria, visual inspection, and integrated photometric redshifts probability distributions predominately at high redshift. Our sample is a robust and highly pure collection of distant galaxies from which we also remove brown dwarf stars, and calculate completeness and contamination from simulations. We include a summary of the basic properties of these $z &gt; 6.5$ galaxies, including their redshift distributions, UV absolute magnitudes, and star formation rates. Our study of these young galaxies reveals a wide range of stellar population properties as seen in their colors and SED fits which we compare to stellar population models, indicating a range of star formation histories, dust, AGN and/or nebular emission. We find a strong trend exists between stellar mass and $(U-V)$ color, as well as the existence of the `main-sequence' of star formation for galaxies as early as $z \sim 12$. This indicates that stellar mass, or an underlying variable correlating with stellar mass, is driving galaxy formation, in agreement with simulation predictions. We also discover ultra-high redshift candidates at $z &gt; 12$ in our sample and describe their properties. Finally, we note a significant observed excess of galaxies compared to models at $z &gt; 12$, revealing a tension between predictions and our observations.

  Continuum reverberation mapping (CRM) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) monitors multiwavelength variability signatures to constrain accretion disk structure and supermassive black hole (SMBH) properties. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will survey tens of millions of AGN over the next decade, with thousands of AGN monitored with almost daily cadence in the deep drilling fields. However, existing CRM methodologies often require long computation time and are not designed to handle such large amount of data. In this paper, we present a fast and flexible inference framework for CRM using simulation-based inference (SBI) with deep learning to estimate SMBH properties from AGN light curves. We use a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) summary network to reduce the high-dimensionality of the light curve data, and then use a neural density estimator to estimate the posterior of SMBH parameters. Using simulated light curves, we find SBI can produce more accurate SMBH parameter estimation with $10^3-10^5$ times speed up in inference efficiency compared to traditional methods. The SBI framework is particularly suitable for wide-field RM surveys as the light curves will have identical observing patterns, which can be incorporated into the SBI simulation. We explore the performance of our SBI model on light curves with irregular-sampled, realistic observing cadence and alternative variability characteristics to demonstrate the flexibility and limitation of the SBI framework.

  (abridged)Photometric redshifts for AGN (galaxies hosting an accreting supermassive black hole in their center) are notoriously challenging and currently better computed via SED fitting, assuming that deep photometry for many wavelengths is available. However, for AGN detected all-sky, the photometry is limited and provided by different projects. This makes the task of homogenising the data challenging and is a dramatic drawback for the millions of AGN that wide surveys like SRG/eROSITA will detect. This work aims to compute reliable photometric redshifts for X-ray-detected AGN using only one dataset that covers a large area: the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey (LS10) for DESI. LS10 provides deep grizW1-W4 forced photometry within various apertures, thus avoids issues related to the cross-calibration of surveys. We present the results from CircleZ, a machine-learning algorithm based on a Fully Connected Neural Network. CircleZ uses training sample of 14,000 X-ray-detected AGN and utilizes multi-aperture photometry. The accuracy and the fraction of outliers reached in a test sample of 2913 AGN are 0.067 and 11.6%, respectively. The results are comparable to or better than those obtained previously for the same field but with much less effort. We further tested the stability of the results by computing the photometric redshifts for the sources detected in CSC2 and Chandra-COSMOS Legacy, reaching comparable accuracy as in eFEDS when limiting the magnitude of the counterparts with respect to the depth of LS10. The method applies to fainter samples of AGN using deeper optical data from future surveys (e.g., LSST, Euclid), granted LS10-like information on the light distribution beyond a morphological type is provided. With the paper, we release an updated version of the photometric redshifts (including errors and probability distribution function) for eROSITA/eFEDS.
