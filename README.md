  Context. AGNs are strong X-ray emitters shaped by disk-corona interactions. The soft excess (0.5-2.0 keV) reveals key information about the "warm corona" bridging the disk and hot corona. Yet, how this feature evolves with accretion properties remains poorly constrained, especially in large samples using spectral stacking. Aims. The eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS:5) provides an unprecedented sample. We investigate how the average AGN X-ray spectra evolve with accretion parameters, and explore disk-corona connection by further combining stacked UV data. Methods. We developed Xstack, a novel tool that stacks rest-frame X-ray spectra and responses while preserving spectral shape through optimized weighting. We stack 17929 AGNs ("spec-z" sample, 23 Ms) with similar X-ray loudness alpha_ox, UV luminosity L_UV, and 4159 AGNs ("BH-mass" sample, 3 Ms) with similar Eddington ratio lambda_Edd and black hole mass M_BH. The resulting stacked X-ray spectra are analyzed with a phenomenological model. We further fit the stacked optical-UV-Xray SED with AGNSED model. Results. Soft excess strengthens strongly with alpha_ox and lambda_Edd (~5), while the hard X-ray spectral shape remains largely unchanged, supporting that soft excess is dominated by warm corona rather than reflection. AGNSED modeling reveals that warm corona radius (R_g units) generally increases with lambda_Edd and decreases with M_BH, or equivalently the disk-to-warm-corona transition consistently occurs near 1e4 K. The hot corona contracts with lambda_Edd and is unaffected by M_BH, aligning with disk evaporation predictions. Conclusions. The soft excess likely originates from a warm corona, with the disk to warm corona transition tied to hydrogen ionization near 1e4 K - supporting earlier eFEDS-HSC stacking results (Hagen et al. 2024). This study shows the strength of spectral stacking in probing AGN disk-corona physics.

  Context. The classification of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a challenge in astrophysics. Variability features extracted from light curves offer a promising avenue for distinguishing AGNs and their subclasses. This approach would be very valuable in sight of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).   Aims. Our goal is to utilize self-organizing maps (SOMs) to classify AGNs based on variability features and investigate how the use of different subsets of features impacts the purity and completeness of the resulting classifications.   Methods. We derived a set of variability features from light curves, similar to those employed in previous studies, and applied SOMs to explore the distribution of AGNs subclasses. We conducted a comparative analysis of the classifications obtained with different subsets of features, focusing on the ability to identify different AGNs types.   Results. Our analysis demonstrates that using SOMs with variability features yields a relatively pure AGNs sample, though completeness remains a challenge. In particular, Type 2 AGNs are the hardest to identify, as can be expected. These results represent a promising step toward the development of tools that may support AGNs selection in future large-scale surveys such as LSST.

  We present the first band-2 (120 - 250 MHz) uGMRT (upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope) observations of the bimodal galaxy cluster Abell 1644 (z = 0.0471), complemented by Chandra X-ray data. While weak lensing measurements reveal a third substructure in Abell 1644, our radio analysis reveals only two compact sources coinciding with the respective brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of the northern (A1644N) and southern (A1644S) substructures, seen in the X-ray observations. Radio analysis yields compact active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered sources with radio power $P_{A1644S} = 1.1\times 10^{23} W/Hz$ and $P_{A1644N} = 7.3\times 10^{23} W/Hz$ at 200MHz. We find no evidence of non-thermal diffuse radio emission, such as halos or relics, within the sensitivity of our band-2 image. We measured the flux density of each radio source and performed spectral analysis. A1644N exhibits a synchrotron power law spectrum while A1644S shows spectral turnover suggestive of synchrotron self-absorption. X-ray analysis reveals two shock fronts at the southern substructure with a Mach number $M= 3.21 \pm 0.51$ and $M= 2.22 \pm 0.07$, indicating an ongoing merger. Our findings reinforce the complex dynamical nature of Abell 1644 and contribute to a deeper understanding of the cluster's thermodynamic state. Future deep radio observations with improved radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation will be crucial for probing non-thermal phenomena in this system.

  Recent analyses from the Pierre Auger Collaboration suggest correlations between the arrival directions of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) and catalogs of starburst galaxies (SGBs) and jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We revisit these analyses using the same methodology as \auger , but explicitly incorporating UHECR deflections in turbulent extragalactic magnetic fields (EGMFs). We demonstrate that while for SBGs the same sources as for the generic \auger\ analysis dominate the catalog correlations, jetted AGNs are dominated by Centaurus~A when accounting for source distances and deflections. Using our framework, we derive 90\% confidence level upper limits on the local EGMF strength of 4.4~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for SBGs and 6.7~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for jetted AGNs. Assuming instead that the UHECR deflections predominantly arise from the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), we obtain a GMF upper limit of $1.4 \, \mu$G~kpc$^{1/2}$ for a Galactic halo size of 30~kpc.   

Measurements of the z=4-10 X-ray Luminosity Function: the high space

  SMBHs are theorised to undergo significant growth in the early Universe, however, the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF), used as a principal tracer of the SMBH accretion density, lacks observational constraints at z&gt;6, until now. We present new measurements of the z=4-10 XLF at intermediate luminosities, taking advantage of recent deep near-IR imaging from UltraVISTA that enables us to identify galaxies and AGN at high redshifts within which we identify X-ray sources using Chandra COSMOS data. We first performed a cross-match to a deep Chandra source list, for which the X-ray sensitivity can be accurately quantified, before exploiting available X-ray data further through direct extraction of X-ray counts at the positions of COSMOS2020 galaxies. With the resulting z=4-10 X-ray AGN sample, comprised of 21 blind detections and 11 directly extracted detections, we have measured the early space density of AGN, at moderate-luminosities where the majority of early SMBH growth occurred. These measurements reveal higher space-densities than expected, based on the extrapolation of XLF models from lower redshifts. Whilst our measured space densities at z=4-5 are consistent with model predictions, at z=5-7 we find space densities of the order of 10$\times$ the extrapolated model predictions and could be as high as 220$\times$ the model extrapolations at z=7-10. In addition, we find evidence that a large fraction of the early AGN population are heavily obscured, with an obscured fraction of 0.982$^{+0.007}_{-0.008}$; correcting for this obscuration further increases the measured space densities. Comparing to recent JWST results, these measurements begin to bridge the gap between the bright-end of the quasar luminosity function and the latest JWST observations of very early, low-luminosity AGN, indicating a larger fraction of the first galaxies play host to rapidly growing SMBH than previously thought.

  The Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey with ASKAP is transforming our understanding of radio galaxies, AGN duty cycles, and cosmic structure. EMUCAT efficiently identifies compact radio sources, yet struggles with extended objects, requiring alternative approaches. The Radio Galaxy Zoo: EMU (RGZ EMU) project proposes a general framework that combines citizen science and machine learning to identify around 4 million extended sources in EMU. This framework is expected to enhance the EMUCAT cataloging on extended sources and can be further empowered with the introduction of cross-matched external data from surveys such as POSSUM and WALLABY.

  We apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the integrated intensity maps of 13 molecular lines of the nearby type-2 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 obtained by Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to objectively visualize the features of its center, (1) within a radius of about 2 kpc ($\sim$ 27".5; hereafter the "overall region") and (2) the ring shaped starburst region between 750 pc ($\sim$ 10") and 2 kpc ($\sim$ 27".5) of the galaxy (hereafter the "SB ring region"). PCA is a powerful unsupervised machine learning technique that extracts key information through dimensionality reduction. The PCA results for the overall region have a possibility to reconstruct a map representing the approximate H$_2$ column density and difference of volume density and/or chemical composition between the circumnuclear disk (CND) and the starburst ring (SB ring). Additionally, the PCA results for the SB ring region have a possibility to reconstruct a map representing the approximate H$_2$ column density and distinction between starburst dominated region and shock dominated region. Furthermore, the PCA results for the SB ring region indicate a possible interaction between the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) outflow and gas in the SB ring. Although further investigation is required, we suggest that the AGN outflow interacts with gas in the SB ring, as this feature is consistent with the direction of the AGN outflow and is contributed by CN, C$_2$H and HCN, which are known to be enhanced by the AGN outflow. These results demonstrate that PCA can effectively extract features even for galaxies with complex structures, such as AGN + SB ring. This study also implies that PCA has the potential to uncover previously unrecognized phenomena by visualizing latent structures in multi-line data.
