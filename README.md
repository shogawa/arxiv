  Context. A defining characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that distinguishes them from other astronomical sources is their stochastic variability, which is observable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Upcoming optical wide-field surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, are set to transform astronomy by delivering unprecedented volumes of data for time domain studies. This data influx will require the development of the expertise and methodologies necessary to manage and analyze it effectively. Aims. This project focuses on optimizing AGN selection through optical variability in wide-field surveys and aims to reduce the bias against obscured AGN. We tested a random forest (RF) algorithm trained on various feature sets to select AGN. The initial dataset consisted of 54 observations in the r-band and 25 in the g-band of the COSMOS field, captured with the VLT Survey Telescope over a 3.3-year baseline. Methods. Our analysis relies on feature sets derived separately from either band plus a set of features combining data from both bands, mostly characterizing AGN on the basis of their variability properties and obtained from their light curves. We trained multiple RF classifiers using different subsets of selected features and assessed their performance via targeted metrics. Results. Our tests provide valuable insights into the use of multiband and multivisit data for AGN identification. We compared our findings with previous studies and dedicated part of the analysis to potential enhancements in selecting obscured AGN. The expertise gained and the methodologies developed here are readily applicable to datasets from other ground- and space-based missions.

  We present velocity-resolved reverberation lags of H-beta for 20 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project. We detect unambiguous velocity-resolved structures in 12 AGNs, among which eight objects exhibit symmetric structures, two objects show inflow-like characteristics, and two objects display outflow-like signatures. For two AGNs, we successfully measure the velocity-resolved lags in different years, revealing evidence of evolving broad-line region (BLR) kinematics. By combining our sample with the literature velocity-resolved lags, we find that the symmetric velocity-resolved lags are the most common (40%) type among this sample. The frequency of inflow kinematics is also notable (20%), while outflow kinematics are less common (11%). Our sample significantly expands the previous velocity-resolved reverberation mapping sample in the high-luminosity regime, enabling us to constrain BLR kinematics across a large dynamic range of luminosity.

  Galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping develop gaseous tails that can extend several kiloparsecs outside the galaxy disc. We used far-ultraviolet and H$\alpha$ imaging from the GASP survey to investigate how different stages of stripping affect star formation properties in the tail and disc of 13 galaxies undergoing stripping. These galaxies have different stripping strengths, as identified from the MUSE integral field spectroscopy. The star-forming knots in the disc and tails show a good correspondence between the measured FUV and H$\alpha$ flux. This is especially true for strong and extreme cases of stripping, which have developed extended ionized gaseous tails featuring clumpy structures. The mechanism behind the H$\alpha$ emission on the tails of these regions, which correlates well with FUV emission, is photoionization caused by young massive stars. The optical emission line ratio maps enable us to understand the emission mechanism, which can be attributed to star formation, LINER activity, or a combination of both phenomena and AGN. The star-forming regions in the emission line maps correspond well to the areas with significant FUV flux in these galaxies. Six galaxies exhibit minimal star formation in their tails, with two cases star formation is limited to the central regions and their discs are truncated. In galaxies with truncated discs, star formation is confined to a smaller region on the disc, as indicated by the FUV flux, compared to H$\alpha$. Galaxies with strong stripping are undergoing recent star formation and are likely recent infalls. Galaxies with truncated discs confine star formation to the center, likely because they have completed a cluster crossing that depleted most of their outer gaseous disc. Galaxies with minimal FUV flux along their tails exhibit unresolved H$\alpha$ emission which may be attributed to processes other than star formation.

  Accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes can potentially form stars within the self-gravitating region. These stars undergo high accretion rates because of the dense environment of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disk. The vorticity of the AGN disk may influence the ultimate mass feeding rate toward the star. In our study, we simulate mass feeding rates onto stars at different AGN disk thicknesses through 3D numerical models to explore the relationship between feeding rates and the thermal mass of the star ($q_{\rm th}$), defined as the ratio of the star's Bondi radius to the AGN disk thickness. Our findings indicate that disk shearing with angular momentum can notably decrease the feeding rate, and we provide an approximate formula that links the feeding rate based on the angular momentum of the surrounding gas and the thermal mass $q_{\rm th}$. Lastly, we examine the potential feedback of the rapidly accreting stars on the AGN disk and their subsequent evolution.

  Galaxy evolution is driven by spatially distributed processes with varying timescales. Integral field spectroscopy provides spatially-resolved information about these processes. Nevertheless, disentangling these processes, which are related to both the underlying stellar populations and the interstellar medium can be challenging. We present a case study on NGC~613, observed with MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) for the TIMER (Time Inference with MUSE in Extragalactic Rings) project, a local barred galaxy, which shows several gas ionisation mechanisms and is rich in both large and inner-scale stellar structures. We develop a set of steps to overcome fundamental problems in the modelling of emission lines with multiple components, together with the characterisation of the stellar populations. That results in the disentanglement of the gas ionisation mechanisms and kinematics, along with an optimal parametrisation for star formation history recovery. Our analysis reveals evidence of gas inflows, which are associated with the bar dust lanes traced with \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope (HST). In addition, we show the gas kinematics in a central biconical outflow, which is aligned with a radio jet observed with Very Large Array (VLA). The emission line provides estimates of electron density, gas-phase metallicity, and the mass outflow rate, allowing us to distinguish intertwined ionisation mechanisms and to identify a part of the multiphase gas cycle in NGC 613. It traces the gas kinematics from the bar lanes to inner scale gas reservoirs, where it can eventually trigger star formation or AGN activity, as observed in the outflow.

  We have analyzed publicly available optical spectra of PMN J0948+0022 obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, X-Shooter, and the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Initially, PMN J0948+0022 was classified as a jetted narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, but X-Shooter and MUSE observations, which have better spectral resolution, revealed a different profile for the H$\beta$ line, from Lorentzian to a composite one (a combination of a broad and a narrow Gaussian), more typical of intermediate Seyfert galaxies. According to the unified model, intermediate Seyferts are viewed at larger angles. However, we show that, in this case, the composite line profile results from the interaction of the powerful relativistic jet with the narrow-line region. The jet transfers part of its kinetic energy to the narrow-line region, producing flux changes in the H$\beta$ narrow component (drop by a factor of 3.4 from SDSS to X-Shooter), [O III]$\lambda$5007 core component (which nearly doubled from X-Shooter to MUSE), and its blue wing ($\Delta$v$\sim$200 km s$^{-1}$), which we interpret as evidence of an outflow. We also recalculated the physical parameters of this AGN, obtaining a black hole mass of $10^{7.8}$ M$_{\odot}$ and an Eddington ratio of $\sim$0.21 (weighted mean).

  We present the X-ray analysis of seven local compact elliptical galaxies (cEGs), selected for their morphological resemblance to high-redshift red nuggets. As likely descendants of the red nugget population, cEGs offer a unique window into the early Universe, enabling the study of early galaxy evolution and the interplay between black holes, stellar bulges, and dark matter halos. Using data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we investigate the properties of the hot gaseous halos in cEGs. Two galaxies - MRK 1216 and PGC 32873 - host luminous, spatially extended X-ray atmospheres, allowing us to derive radial thermodynamic profiles. For MRK 1216, we performed high-resolution spectral modeling with RGS data, which hints at super-solar $\alpha/\rm{Fe}$ abundance ratios. The remaining galaxies show either faint or undetected X-ray halos, though several display AGN-like (active galactic nucleus) power-law emission. In the context of local scaling relations, cEGs show only mild deviations from the general galaxy population, exhibiting a slightly steeper $M_{\star}-L_{X}$ relation and occupying the lower boundary of the $M_{\star}$-$M_{\rm vir}$ relation. These trends suggest that high-redshift red nuggets may also host a diverse range of X-ray atmospheres. We speculate that the compactness of cEGs may trace back to the population of `little red dots' (LRDs), hinting at a potential link between LRDs, red nuggets, and compact relic galaxies in the local Universe.
