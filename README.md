  This paper explores the application of machine learning methods for classifying astronomical sources using photometric data, including normal and emission line galaxies (ELGs; starforming, starburst, AGN, broad line), quasars, and stars. We utilized samples from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 17 (DR17) and the ALLWISE catalog, which contain spectroscopically labeled sources from SDSS. Our methodology comprises two parts. First, we conducted experiments, including three-class, four-class, and seven-class classifications, employing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. This phase aimed to achieve optimal performance with balanced datasets. In the second part, we trained various machine learning methods, such as $k$-nearest neighbors (KNN), RF, XGBoost (XGB), voting, and artificial neural network (ANN), using all available data based on promising results from the first phase. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining optical and infrared features, yielding the best performance across all classifiers. Specifically, in the three-class experiment, RF and XGB algorithms achieved identical average F1 scores of 98.93 per~cent on both balanced and unbalanced datasets. In the seven-class experiment, our average F1 score was 73.57 per~cent. Using the XGB method in the four-class experiment, we achieved F1 scores of 87.9 per~cent for normal galaxies (NGs), 81.5 per~cent for ELGs, 99.1 per~cent for stars, and 98.5 per~cent for quasars (QSOs). Unlike classical methods based on time-consuming spectroscopy, our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using automated algorithms on carefully classified photometric data. With more data and ample training samples, detailed photometric classification becomes possible, aiding in the selection of follow-up observation candidates.

  We present an analysis of the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies ($M_* &gt; 10^{9.5} M_\odot$) within the first 0.5 - 3 Gyr of the Universe's history utilizing JWST-CEERS data. We utilize a combination of advanced statistical methods to accurately constrain the intrinsic dependence of quenching in a multi-dimensional and inter-correlated parameter space. Specifically, we apply Random Forest (RF) classification, area statistics, and a partial correlation analysis to the JWST-CEERS data. First, we identify the key testable predictions from two state-of-the-art cosmological simulations (IllustrisTNG &amp; EAGLE). Both simulations predict that quenching should be regulated by supermassive black hole mass in the early Universe. Furthermore, both simulations identify the stellar potential ($\phi_*$) as the optimal proxy for black hole mass in photometric data. In photometric observations, where we have no direct constraints on black hole masses, we find that the stellar potential is the most predictive parameter of massive galaxy quenching at all epochs from $z = 0 - 8$, exactly as predicted by simulations for this sample. The stellar potential outperforms stellar mass, galaxy size, galaxy density, and S\'ersic index as a predictor of quiescence at all epochs probed in JWST-CEERS. Collectively, these results strongly imply a stable quenching mechanism operating throughout cosmic history, which is closely connected to the central gravitational potential in galaxies. This connection is explained in cosmological models via massive black holes forming and growing in deep potential wells, and subsequently quenching galaxies through a mix of ejective and preventative active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback.
