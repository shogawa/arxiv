  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) exhibit excess mid-infrared H$_2$ emission compared to star-forming galaxies, likely driven by outflows and shocks inferred from integrated spectra. We present optical IFU observations of the central 2\,kpc of the AGN host CGCG 012-070, selected for its pronounced H$_2$ emission excess, to map stellar and gas kinematics. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disc with a line of nodes at $103^\circ \pm 4^\circ$, with the northwest side approaching and the southeast side receding. Gas kinematics, traced by strong emission lines, show two components: a narrow one ($\sigma \lesssim 200\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) in the disc plane following stellar motions, and a broad ($\sigma \gtrsim 300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) associated with outflows within the inner $\sim$1\,kpc. Disc gas emission is mainly driven by AGN photoionization, while the outflow also includes shock-heated gas, as indicated by flux ratio diagnostics. The outflows are radiatively driven, with a mass-outflow rate of $(0.067 \pm 0.026)\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and a kinetic coupling efficiency of 0.07%, potentially redistributing gas and contributing to maintenance-mode feedback in CGCG 012-070. Our results provide further evidence that the warm H$_2$ emission excess in nearby AGN is associated with shocks produced by outflows. Observations of other gas phases, such as cold molecular gas, are necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the outflows on the host galaxy.

  We present high-sensitivity follow-up observations of the giant fossil radio lobe in the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in the 125-250 MHz and 300-500 MHz frequency bands. The new data have sufficient angular resolution to exclude compact sources and enable us to trace the faint extended emission from the relic lobe to a remarkable distance of 820 kpc from the cluster center. The new images reveal intricate spatial structure within the fossil lobe, including narrow (5-10 kpc), long (70-100 kpc) radio filaments embedded within the diffuse emission at the bottom of the lobe. The filaments exhibit a very steep spectrum ($S_\nu\propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \sim 3$), significantly steeper than the ambient synchrotron emission from the lobe ($\alpha \sim 1.5-2$); they mostly disappear in recently-published MeerKAT images at 1.28 GHz. Their origin is unclear; similar features observed in some other radio lobes typically have a spectrum flatter than that of their ambient medium. These radio filaments may trace regions where the magnetic field has been stretched and amplified by gas circulation within the rising bubble. The spectrum of the brightest region of the radio lobe exhibits a spectral break, which corresponds to a radiative cooling age of the fossil lobe of approximately 174 Myr, giving a date for this most powerful AGN explosion.

  We analyze eight spectroscopically confirmed Little Red Dots (LRDs) at redshifts z = 5.1-8.7 with JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI data. The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W &gt; 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, -0.5 &lt; F444W - F770W &lt; 0.5, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have -1.0 &lt; F1000W - F1500W &lt; 1.1, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model can fully reproduce all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad H$_\alpha$ have SEDs that can be reproduced with hot, dense-gas (log T/K=5-5.7, log n/cm$^{-3}$ = 9-11) models with low dust attenuation (A(V)~ 0.5mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require log L$_{bol}$/L$_\odot$ &lt;12. These results suggest that our LRDs cannot be modeled entirely with standard templates, but instead require a novel treatment of gas conditions, AGN and star-formation.
