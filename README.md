  Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei (CL AGN) can be generally confirmed by the emergence (turn-on) or disappearance (turn-off) of broad emission lines, associated with a transient timescale (about $100\sim5000$ days) that is much shorter than predicted by traditional accretion disk models. We carry out a systematic CL AGN search by cross-matching the spectra coming from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Following previous studies, we identify CL AGN based on $\rm{H}\alpha $, $\rm{H}\beta$, and Mg\,{\sc ii} at $z\leq0.75$ and Mg\,{\sc ii}, C\,{\sc iii}], and C\,{\sc iv} at $z&gt;0.75$. We present 130 CL AGN based on visual inspection and three selection criteria, including 2 $\rm{H}\alpha$, 45 $\rm{H}\beta$, 38 Mg\,{\sc ii}, 61 C\,{\sc iii}], and 10 C\,{\sc iv} CL AGN. Twenty cases show simultaneous appearances/disappearances of two broad emission lines while three AGN exhibit the concurrent appearance of three broad emission lines. We also present 91 CL AGN candidates with significant flux variation of broad emission lines but remaining strong broad components. In the confirmed CL AGN, 42 cases show additional CL candidate features for different lines. In this paper, we find 1) a 95:35 ratio of a turn-on to turn-off CL AGN; 2) the highest redshift CL AGN ($z=3.56$) ever discovered; 3) an upper limit transition timescale ranging from 244 to 5762 days in the rest-frame; 4) the majority of CL AGN follow the bluer-when-brighter trend. Our results greatly increase the current CL census ($30\sim50\%$) and would be conducive to explore the underlying physical mechanism.

  High energies emissions observed in X-ray binaries (XRBs), active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are linearly polarized. The prominent mechanism for X-ray is the Comptonization process. We revisit the theory for polarization in Compton scattering with unpolarized electrons, and note that the ($k \times k'$)-coordinate (in which, ($k \times k'$) acts as a $z$-axis, here $k$ and $k'$ are incident and scattered photon momentum respectively) is more convenient to describe it. Interestingly, for a fixed scattering plane the degree of polarization PD after single scattering for random oriented low-energy unpolarized incident photons is $\sim$0.3. At the scattering angle $\theta$ = 0 or $\theta \equiv$ [0,25$^o$], the modulation curve of $k'$ exhibits the same PD and PA (angle of polarization) of $k$, and even the distribution of projection of electric vector of $k'$ ($k'_e$) on perpendicular plane to the $k$ indicates same (so, an essential criteria for detector designing). We compute the polarization state in Comptonization process using Monte Carlo methods with considering a simple spherical corona. We obtain the PD of emergent photons as a function of $\theta$-angle (or alternatively, the disk inclination angle $i$) on a meridian plane (i.e., the laws of darkening, formulated by Chandrasekhar 1946) after single scattering with unpolarized incident photons. To explore the energy dependency we consider a general spectral parameter set corresponding to hard and soft states of XRBs, we find that for average scattering no. $\langle N_{sc}\rangle$ $\sim$1.1 the PD is independent of energy and PA $\sim$90$^o$ ($k'_e$ is parallel to the disk plane), and for $\langle N_{sc}\rangle$ $\sim$5 the PD value is maximum for $i$=45$^o$. We also compare the results qualitatively with observation of IXPE for five sources.

  We studied the broadband X-ray spectra of {\it Swift}/BAT selected low-accreting AGNs using the observations from {\it XMM-Newton}, {\it Swift}, and {\it NuSTAR} in the energy range of $0.5-150$~keV. Our sample consists of 30 AGNs with Eddington ratio, $\lambda_{\rm Edd}&lt;10^{-3}$. We extracted several coronal parameters from the spectral modelling, such as the photon index, hot electron plasma temperature, cutoff energy, and optical depth. We tested whether there exists any correlation/anti-correlation among different spectral parameters. We observe that the relation of hot electron temperature with the cutoff energy in the low accretion domain is similar to what is observed in the high accretion domain. We did not observe any correlation between the Eddington ratio and the photon index. We studied the compactness-temperature diagram and found that the cooling process for extremely low-accreting AGNs is complex. The jet luminosity is calculated from the radio flux, and observed to be related to the bolometric luminosity as $L_{\rm jet} \propto L_{\rm bol}^{0.7}$, which is consistent with the standard radio-X-ray correlation.   

The Effect of Thermal Torques on AGN Disc Migration Traps and

  Accretion discs in active galactic nuclei (AGN) foster black hole (BH) formation, growth, and mergers. Stellar mass BHs migrate inwards under the influence of hydrodynamical torques unless they encounter a region where the torque flips sign. At these migration traps, BHs accumulate and merge via dynamical or gas-assisted interactions, producing high-frequency LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) sources and potentially cutting off the supply of extreme mass ratio inspirals that would otherwise make low-frequency, {\it LISA}-band GWs. In this paper, we study the interplay between different types of migration torques, focusing especially on the ``thermal torques'' generated by the thermal response of the AGN to embedded stellar-mass BHs that accrete through their own mini-discs.In contrast to previous work, we find that Type I torques cannot produce migration traps on their own, but thermal torques often do, particularly in low-mass AGN. The migration traps produced by thermal torques exist at much larger radii ($\sim 10^{3-5}$ gravitational radii) than do previously identified Type I traps, carrying implications for GW populations at multiple frequencies. Finally, we identify a bifurcation of AGN discs into two regimes: migration traps exist below a critical AGN luminosity, and do not at higher luminosities. This critical luminosity is fit as $\log_{10} L_{\rm AGN}^c = 45 - 0.32 \log_{10}{(\alpha/0.01)}$ where $\alpha$ is the AGN alpha viscosity parameter, a range compatible with recent claims that LVK GWs are not preferentially associated with high-luminosity AGN.

  We present an analysis of a sample of robust high redshift galaxies selected photometrically from the `blank' fields of the Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization Science (PEARLS) survey and Early Release Observations (ERO) data of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the aim of selecting candidate high redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN). Sources were identified from the parent sample using a threefold selection procedure, which includes spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to identify sources that are best fitted by AGN SED templates, a further selection based on the relative performance of AGN and non-AGN models, and finally morphological fitting to identify compact sources of emission, resulting in a purity-oriented procedure. Using this procedure, we identify a sample of nine AGN candidates at $6.5 &lt; z &lt; 12$, from which we constrain their physical properties as well as measure a lower bound on the AGN fraction in this redshift range of $5 \pm 1$\%. As this is an extreme lower limit due to our focus on purity and our SEDs being calibrated for unobscured Type 1 AGN, this demonstrates that AGN are perhaps quite common at this early epoch. The rest-frame UV colors of our candidate objects suggest that these systems are potentially candidate obese black hole galaxies (OBG), or AGN with very little galaxy component. We also investigate emission from our sample sources from fields overlapping with Chandra and VLA surveys, allowing us to place X-ray and 3 GHz radio detection limits on our candidates. Of note is a $z = 11.9$ candidate source exhibiting an abrupt morphological shift in the reddest band as compared to the bluer bands, indicating a potential merger or an unusually strong outflow.
