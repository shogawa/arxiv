  We present high-resolution e-MERLIN and EVN (e-VLBI) observations of a radio source associated with Dyson Sphere candidate G, identified as part of Project Hephaistos. The radio source, VLASS J233532.86-000424.9, is resolved into 3 compact components and shows the typical characteristics of a radio-loud AGN. In particular, the EVN observations show that it has a brightness temperature in excess of $10^{8}$~K. No radio emission is detected at the position of the M-dwarf star. This result confirms our earlier hypothesis, that at least some of the Dyson Sphere candidates of project Hephaistos are contaminated by obscured, background AGN, lying close to the line of sight of otherwise normal galactic stars. High-resolution radio observations of other Dyson Sphere candidates can be useful in distinguishing truly promising candidates from those contaminated by background sources.

  Radio observations can provide crucial insight into the nature of a new abundant and mysterious population of dust-reddened active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). In this study, we search for radio bright sources in a large sample of $\sim$700 JWST discovered AGN candidates ($z\sim2-11$) in the 0.144-3 GHz frequency range, utilizing deep radio imaging in COSMOS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S. Only one source is significantly detected in our radio surveys, which is PRIMER-COS 3866 at $z=4.66$. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation origin with a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ and a radio-loudness of $R\approx0.5$. The derived brightness temperature limit of PRIMER-COS 3866 of $T_b \gtrsim 10^{3}$ K is too low to confirm its AGN nature. Our stacking results yield non-detections in all fields with the most constraining 3$\sigma$ limit $L_{1.3\text{GHz}} &lt; 1.3\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (rms of $\sim$0.15 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at $z_{\text{median}}=6.1$) obtained for photometrically selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This result is still consistent with expectations from the empirical $L_X - L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ and $L_X - L_R$ correlations established for local AGN. We conclude that current radio observations have insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak. We project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able to obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial measurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for distinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant population.
